  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::header()] [Error handling bypass] Does the Result return type for header() allow error suppression where invalid headers fail silently, causing security configurations to be skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::api_key()] [Bearer token injection] Can the format!('Bearer {}', api_key) be exploited if api_key contains special characters or additional Bearer prefixes to inject malformed authorization headers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::api_key()] [API key validation bypass] Does api_key() validate that the provided key matches expected format/length, or can arbitrary strings be accepted as valid API keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::api_key()] [Empty key bypass] Can an empty string or whitespace-only api_key create a 'Bearer ' header that might bypass authentication checks expecting a missing header? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::api_key()] [Header value overflow] Can an extremely long api_key string cause HeaderValue::from_str() to fail or create truncated authorization headers? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::version_path_base()] [Path traversal] Can version_path_base accept values with ../ sequences that could be combined with base_url to access unauthorized API endpoints or server resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::version_path_base()] [API version bypass] Can an attacker set version_path_base to an empty string or '/' to bypass version-specific API validation and access deprecated or vulnerable endpoints?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Panic on build] Does the unwrap() on reqwest_builder.build() cause panic if the client configuration is invalid, potentially crashing applications during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Cookie persistence security] Does cookie_store(true) enable persistent cookies without HttpOnly/Secure flags validation, potentially exposing session tokens to XSS or downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Cookie injection] Can a malicious server set cookies that are automatically sent to all subsequent Aptos node requests, potentially leaking authentication state across different nodes?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [TLS validation bypass] Does the reqwest client builder enable TLS certificate validation by default, or can man-in-the-middle attacks intercept traffic to Aptos nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Version path override] Does get_version_path_with_base() override the manually set version_path_base, potentially causing unexpected API endpoint resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Header propagation] Are all custom headers including potentially malicious ones propagated to the final client without sanitization or validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::build()] [Default timeout override] Is the explicitly set timeout properly applied, or can the default 10s timeout be used instead due to configuration ordering issues? (Low)",
