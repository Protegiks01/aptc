  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Version Compatibility] If these types evolve with new fields, will old serialized data fail to deserialize or deserialize with incorrect default values causing execution errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: SubBlockIdx] [Invariant: Round Bounds] Is there an invariant that round_id must be < GLOBAL_ROUND_ID for sharded execution or == GLOBAL_ROUND_ID for global execution, and is this enforced? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: SubBlockIdx] [Invariant: Shard Bounds] Is there an invariant that shard_id must be < num_shards for sharded execution or == GLOBAL_SHARD_ID for global execution, and is this validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Invariant: Index Consistency] Should pre_partitioned_txn_idx always be consistent with the sub_block_idx's round and shard, and is this relationship validated anywhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Type: PrePartitionedTxnIdx] [Monotonicity] Must PrePartitionedTxnIdx values be monotonically increasing within a block, and is this property checked to prevent transaction reordering attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: SubBlockIdx] [Zero Values] Can round_id=0 and shard_id=0 create confusion with uninitialized or default values, causing the first sub-block to be skipped or executed incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: SubBlockIdx] [Maximum Values] When round_id or shard_id are near usize::MAX, can comparisons or arithmetic operations produce incorrect results due to overflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Empty Block] How are ShardedTxnIndexV2 instances handled for empty sub-blocks (no transactions), and can this cause off-by-one errors in index calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Single Transaction] When a sub-block contains only one transaction, are index boundaries calculated correctly, or can fencepost errors cause adjacent transactions to be incorrectly grouped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Impl Ord] [Comparison Complexity] Is the comparison operation O(1), or can deeply nested tuples or complex comparisons cause performance degradation when sorting large sets of indices? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone Cost] Can repeated cloning of ShardedTxnIndexV2 in hot paths cause performance issues, and should references be used instead to avoid unnecessary copies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Type: StorageKeyIdx] [Index Explosion] Can an attacker submit blocks with millions of unique storage keys causing StorageKeyIdx to grow unbounded and exhaust validator memory? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Dependency Cycles] Can circular dependencies between shards be represented using ShardedTxnIndexV2, causing deadlocks where each shard waits for another to complete? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Cross-Round Dependencies] Can dependencies span across rounds (e.g., transaction in round 2 depends on transaction in round 1), and does the ordering correctly enforce this? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Global to Shard Dependencies] Can transactions in the global round correctly express dependencies on transactions in earlier sharded rounds, or will ordering issues cause premature global execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Shard to Global Dependencies] Can sharded transactions correctly depend on global transactions from earlier blocks, ensuring cross-block dependency tracking works properly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [TODO: Line 11] [Enum Conversion] The TODO suggests converting SubBlockIdx to an enum to better represent global executor assignment - what security implications does the current struct-based approach have that motivated this TODO? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [TODO: Line 50] [Capacity Planning] The TODO about ensuring StorageKeyIdx can support max unique state keys suggests this wasn't validated - can worst-case blocks exceed usize capacity causing overflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [Contract Violation] The comment at line 58 mentions this is different from aptos_types::block_executor::partitioner::ShardedTxnIndex - can confusion between these two types cause incorrect cross-module usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Type Aliases] [Insufficient Documentation] Are the differences between OriginalTxnIdx, PrePartitionedTxnIdx, and FinalTxnIdx clearly documented, or can developers misuse these types causing index confusion bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [All Types] [External Usage] When these types are passed to external modules (executor, VM, storage), are proper bounds checks performed, or can out-of-bounds indices cause panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: SubBlockIdx] [Executor Integration] Does the sharded executor correctly handle the transition from sharded sub-blocks to the global sub-block, or can transactions be executed in the wrong phase? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/types.rs] [Struct: ShardedTxnIndexV2] [State Commitment] When computing state commitments after sharded execution, does the system correctly account for transaction ordering defined by ShardedTxnIndexV2, ensuring deterministic state roots?
