(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] When calculating num_threads + 2 on line 32, can integer overflow occur if num_threads is close to usize::MAX, leading to unexpected thread pool sizes or panics? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: execute_global_txns()] [Dependency Cycle] The TransactionWithDependencies vector on line 46 may contain circular dependencies - does the execution logic detect and reject cycles, or can attackers create infinite loops causing validator hang? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: execute_global_txns()] [Dependency Validation] Are cross-shard dependencies in TransactionWithDependencies validated before execution?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: execute_global_txns()] [Missing Dependency] If a transaction depends on data from a shard that hasn't completed execution, does the global executor properly wait or does it proceed with stale/missing data causing state divergence?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: new()] [Concurrency Mismatch] The concurrency_level field is stored but may differ from actual thread pool size (num_threads + 2) - can this mismatch cause incorrect parallelism assumptions in downstream execution logic?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/global_executor.rs] [Function: execute_global_txns()] [Error Propagation] VMStatus errors are propagated directly from ShardedExecutorService - can malicious transactions trigger specific VMStatus errors that are misinterpreted by callers, leading to incorrect state commits?
