  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Hash preimage attack] If an attacker can find two different Transaction objects that produce the same encode_value() bytes, can they exploit this to create hash collisions in TransactionByHashSchema, breaking transaction uniqueness guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Hash binding] Is the transaction hash computed over the BCS bytes from encode_value() or over the Transaction object directly, and could this mismatch allow an attacker to modify stored bytes without changing the hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Accumulator poisoning] Can an attacker modify stored transaction bytes in a way that doesn't affect the transaction accumulator hash, allowing them to alter historical transactions without breaking Merkle proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [State root manipulation] If transaction execution depends on decode_value() returning exact bytes, can an attacker modify those bytes post-storage to change execution outcomes while maintaining the same state root? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Version enumeration] Can an attacker use decode_key() error messages to enumerate which versions exist in the database, leaking information about transaction volume and timing that could be used for deanonymization attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Unbounded iteration] Does TransactionSchema enforce limits on get_transaction_iter() range queries, or can an attacker request millions of transactions causing memory exhaustion when all values are decode_value()'d? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Column family confusion] Can an attacker write to TRANSACTION_CF_NAME column family using a different schema, bypassing TransactionSchema's encode/decode logic and injecting malicious data that causes corruption when read? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Compaction policy exploitation] Could an attacker craft transactions that exploit RocksDB's compaction policy to cause excessive disk I/O, slowing down validators and affecting consensus participation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Migration corruption] During a protocol upgrade that changes Transaction enum structure, can old BCS-encoded transactions fail decode_value() catastrophically, preventing validators from reading historical transactions and breaking the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionSchema] [Rollback attack] If validators rollback to an old version after transactions are stored with new encode_value() format, can decode_value() in the old code produce different results, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Script payload injection] Can an attacker modify a stored UserTransaction's Script payload bytes after storage, causing decode_value() to return a transaction that executes different Move bytecode than originally signed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [EntryFunction manipulation] Can stored EntryFunction transaction bytes be tampered with to change the target module/function, allowing an attacker to redirect transaction execution to malicious Move code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Signature stripping] After a signed transaction is stored, can an attacker modify the BCS bytes to remove or alter the TransactionAuthenticator, causing decode_value() to return an unsigned transaction that bypasses authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Multi-agent forgery] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes for a multi-agent transaction with forged secondary_signer_addresses that pass decode_value() but weren't in the original signed transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Gas price manipulation] Can stored transaction bytes be modified to change max_gas_amount or gas_unit_price fields, allowing an attacker to alter transaction fees retroactively and affect validator rewards?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Sequence number modification] Can an attacker alter the sequence_number field in stored transaction bytes, breaking replay protection and allowing the same transaction to be executed multiple times with different sequences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Nonce manipulation] For transactions using ReplayProtector::Nonce, can stored bytes be modified to change the nonce value, bypassing nonce-based replay protection? (Critical)",
