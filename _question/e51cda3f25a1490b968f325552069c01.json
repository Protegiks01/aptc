  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Timestamp Absence] Does CollectionUriMutateEvent lack timestamp information, making it impossible to determine when URI mutations occurred, enabling time-based attacks or ambiguity in event ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Listener Exploitation] Can malicious contracts listening for CollectionUriMutateEvents be triggered by crafted events to execute unintended logic, enabling reentrancy-like attacks on event subscribers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Cross-Module Event Injection] Can events from other modules with similar structure be type-confused with CollectionUriMutateEvent, causing incorrect processing and potential security violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Circular Event Dependencies] Can emitting CollectionUriMutateEvents trigger cascading events that eventually loop back, creating infinite event emission loops that halt transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [API Query Injection] When CollectionUriMutateEvents are exposed through REST APIs, can the string fields be exploited for query parameter injection attacks affecting API consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Indexer State Corruption] Can malformed CollectionUriMutateEvents cause indexer state machines to enter invalid states, preventing processing of subsequent valid events and causing permanent indexer failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Cache Poisoning] If event data is cached by APIs or frontends, can attackers emit malicious CollectionUriMutateEvents that poison caches with incorrect URI data, affecting all users until cache expiry? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Front-Running] Can attackers monitor pending URI mutation transactions and front-run them with their own malicious URI changes, exploiting MEV opportunities in NFT metadata updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [URI Squatting] Can attackers emit events claiming popular or valuable URI patterns before legitimate creators, enabling URI namespace squatting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Spam Event Economics] What prevents attackers from emitting millions of CollectionUriMutateEvents to spam indexers and explorers, given that event emission may be cheaper than the damage caused? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Consensus Manipulation] Can malicious validators selectively include or exclude CollectionUriMutateEvents to manipulate which URI mutations are recorded on-chain, enabling censorship attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Fork Ambiguity] During chain reorganizations or forks, can CollectionUriMutateEvents be replayed or reordered in ways that create ambiguity about the correct current URI for collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Pruning Attack] If historical events are pruned from storage, can attackers exploit the lack of old_uri verification to falsify historical URI mutation records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: new_uri] [Content Injection] Can new_uri point to malicious content (malware, phishing, illegal content) that gets automatically fetched by indexers or wallets, exposing users to security risks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: new_uri] [Redirect Attacks] Can new_uri contain redirect chains that bypass content filtering, allowing attackers to switch collection metadata to malicious content after initial verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: collection_name] [Name Collision] Can different creators use identical collection_name values, causing ambiguity in which collection's URI was mutated and enabling impersonation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic Safety] Does try_from_bytes() guarantee panic-free operation for all possible input byte sequences, or can certain inputs cause panics that crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Empty Input] How does try_from_bytes() handle empty byte slices - does it return a proper error or potentially create an invalid event instance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Empty Strings] Can collection_name, old_uri, or new_uri be empty strings, and if so, how do downstream systems handle such events - could this enable deletion or corruption of collection metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Whitespace Attack] Can string fields contain only whitespace or control characters, bypassing validation while appearing empty, enabling stealth metadata mutations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Dependencies] [BCS Library Vulnerability] Does the dependency on the bcs crate introduce vulnerabilities if that library has deserialization bugs, allowing malicious events to exploit validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Dependencies] [Serde Vulnerability] Can vulnerabilities in the serde derive macros (Serialize, Deserialize) be exploited to bypass validation or cause unsafe behavior during event processing? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Repr Layout] Does the struct have a guaranteed memory layout (repr(C) or repr(packed)), or can Rust compiler optimizations reorder fields causing deserialization incompatibilities across compiler versions?
