  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-log-derive/src/lib.rs] [Function: derive()] [Key collision] Can duplicate field names cause Key::new() calls at lines 83 and 88 to create colliding keys, potentially causing log entries to overwrite each other and hide security events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-log-derive/src/lib.rs] [Function: derive()] [Ordering vulnerability] Does the order of visit_pair() calls match the struct field declaration order, or could field reordering cause inconsistent log output that obscures attack patterns? (Low)",
