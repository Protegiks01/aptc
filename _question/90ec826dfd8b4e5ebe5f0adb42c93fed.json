  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: path_to_string()] [Platform Differences] On non-Unix systems, path conversion behavior differs - can this cause inconsistent file references or broken links across platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: compute_output_file()] [File Extension] The code uses `.with_extension(\\",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_module()] [Empty Module] What happens when documenting completely empty modules with no functions, structs, or constants? Can this cause empty sections or broken HTML? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_index()] [Sorting Logic] The index sorts modules by simple name - can modules with identical names but different addresses cause incorrect ordering or duplicates? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: compute_declared_schemas()] [Schema Detection] Schema detection iterates spec blocks - can schemas defined in unexpected places be missed, causing broken cross-references? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Const MAX_SUBSECTIONS] [Hard Limit] The maximum subsection limit is 6 - is this sufficient for all documentation needs, or can legitimate deeply nested documentation trigger the panic? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: no_link_module()] [Autolink Heuristic] The code filters out 'result' module from autolinks - are there other common names that could cause false positive links? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_struct_fields()] [Field Display] When displaying struct fields, can extremely long field names or type names cause formatting issues or line breaks in unexpected places? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_enum_inner()] [Variant Display] For enum variants, nested collapsible sections are created - can deeply nested enum structures cause HTML nesting issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: named_constant_display()] [Const Display] Named constant values are displayed using `env.display()` - can extremely large constant values cause memory or formatting issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: ability_tokens()] [Ability Display] Ability set conversion to string tokens - can invalid or custom abilities cause incorrect display or missing information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Struct Docgen] [Thread Safety] The struct contains RefCell fields (label_counter, toc, section_nest, last_root_section_nest) - is this struct intended to be Send/Sync, and could concurrent access cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_toc()] [RefCell Borrowing] Multiple borrow_mut() calls on RefCell fields - can nested calls or unexpected control flow cause borrow checker panics at runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_toc()] [Label Insertion] The code uses `writer.insert_at_label()` to insert TOC - can incorrect label management cause content to be inserted in wrong locations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: expand_root_template()] [Writer State] The writer is replaced with `std::mem::replace()` during TOC generation - can this cause state inconsistencies if errors occur during processing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: resolve_to_label()] [Resolution Heuristic] The resolution uses heuristics and may not work in all cases - can ambiguous names cause wrong cross-references that mislead documentation readers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: resolve_to_label()] [Alias Handling] The comment says it ignores aliases - can this cause broken links when aliases are commonly used in the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: try_func_struct_or_const()] [Name Resolution] The closure checks multiple name types - can name collisions between constants, functions, and structs cause incorrect link targets? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Struct DocgenOptions] [Validation] Are option values validated before use? Can invalid combinations like negative section_level_start or toc_depth cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: is_mdx_compatible()] [Mode Detection] The MDX compatibility check uses is_some_and() - can the output_format being None cause subtle bugs in MDX-specific code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: get_source_with_indent()] [Source Extraction] The heuristic for guessing indentation looks back 60 characters - can this fail for unusual formatting or cause incorrect indentation in generated docs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: get_source_with_indent()] [Special Cases] Special case handling for 'spec ' keyword - are there other keywords or contexts that need special handling but are missing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Output Map] The output BTreeMap uses file paths as keys - can duplicate file paths cause documentation to be silently overwritten or merged incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_module()] [Filter Logic] Test-only functions and structs are filtered out - can the is_test_only() check be bypassed to include test code in production documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_module()] [Module Usage] Used modules are collected with include_specs=false - does this correctly handle all module dependency scenarios? (Low)"
