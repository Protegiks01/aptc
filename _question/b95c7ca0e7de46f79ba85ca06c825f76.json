  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/gas.rs] [Function: generate_gas_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash collision] Can an attacker craft two different GasScheduleV2 objects that produce the same Sha3-512 hash, allowing them to pass hash verification while deploying a malicious gas schedule with zero-cost operations that would enable unlimited transaction flooding? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/gas.rs] [Function: generate_gas_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash preimage attack] Can an attacker compute a preimage for a known old_hash value to bypass the set_for_next_epoch_check_hash validation in lines 132-139, allowing them to deploy an arbitrary gas schedule without proper authorization checks? (Critical)",

(High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/gas.rs] [Function: generate_gas_upgrade_proposal()] [BCS deserialization bomb] Can an attacker craft a malicious GasScheduleV2 with deeply nested structures that causes bcs::to_bytes at line 103 or line 124 to consume excessive memory, crashing the release builder process and preventing legitimate gas updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/gas.rs] [Function: generate_gas_upgrade_proposal()] [BCS non-determinism] Are there any edge cases where bcs::to_bytes produces different byte sequences for the same GasScheduleV2 object across different Rust versions or platforms, causing hash mismatches that permanently brick gas schedule updates?

(High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/gas.rs] [Function: generate_gas_upgrade_proposal()] [Panic-based DoS] The assertion at line 125 will panic if the size check fails - can an attacker intentionally trigger this panic during governance proposal generation to prevent legitimate gas updates and freeze gas costs at exploitable values?
