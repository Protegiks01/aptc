  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Configuration vulnerability] If the MAX_RANGE_BITS constant (64) is modified in a protocol upgrade to a value larger than what the underlying bulletproofs library supports, could this cause verification failures or consensus divergence across validators running different versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Integer overflow] Can the MAX_RANGE_BITS value of 64 cause integer overflow vulnerabilities when calculating 2^64 ranges in consuming code, potentially allowing values outside the valid range to pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Type safety] Is the usize type appropriate for MAX_RANGE_BITS on 32-bit architectures, or could casting between usize and u64 in verification functions cause truncation vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Cryptographic security] Does the 64-bit range limit provide sufficient security against brute-force attacks on bulletproof range proofs, or could attackers exploit the upper bound to create invalid proofs that appear valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Documentation accuracy] The comment states 'Might need to revisit this later' - if this constant needs to change in the future, is there a safe upgrade path that won't break existing proofs on-chain or cause chain splits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Boundary condition] Can attackers submit range proofs for exactly 2^64 or 2^64-1 values that might cause off-by-one errors in verification logic that uses this constant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Consistency check] Is MAX_RANGE_BITS consistently used across all bulletproofs-related code, or are there hardcoded '64' values elsewhere that could cause inconsistencies if this constant is changed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Generator capacity] Does the BulletproofGens initialization in consuming code properly use MAX_RANGE_BITS to ensure generator capacity matches the maximum range, or could mismatches cause verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Move VM integration] When this constant is used in Move native functions, are there checks to ensure Move contracts cannot request ranges larger than MAX_RANGE_BITS through gas exhaustion or abort code manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bulletproofs/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_RANGE_BITS] [Backwards compatibility] If MAX_RANGE_BITS were increased in a future version, would existing on-chain range proofs with smaller bit lengths remain valid, or could this break verification of historical transactions? (High)"
