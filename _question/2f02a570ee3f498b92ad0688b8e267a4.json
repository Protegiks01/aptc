  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker bypass token validation entirely by simply adding the X_IS_JWT_HEADER to their request without providing a valid JWT, allowing unlimited unauthorized faucet access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header case sensitivity] Does the X_IS_JWT_HEADER check use case-sensitive comparison, allowing attackers to bypass validation using 'X-IS-JWT', 'x-is-jwt', or 'X-Is-Jwt' header variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Logic flaw] Is there a race condition where an attacker can set X_IS_JWT_HEADER but the JWT validation in firebase_jwt.rs fails, yet this checker still allows the request through, bypassing all authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header injection] Can attackers inject multiple X_IS_JWT_HEADER entries to confuse the validation logic and bypass token checking through header duplication attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Authentication flow] Does the code verify that when X_IS_JWT_HEADER is present, a valid JWT was actually verified elsewhere, or does it blindly trust the header presence allowing unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Input validation] Can an attacker provide a malformed Authorization header like 'Bearer  ' (with only whitespace after Bearer) that passes split_whitespace().nth(1) but causes downstream issues or bypasses validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token extraction] Does split_whitespace().nth(1) properly handle Authorization headers with multiple spaces like 'Bearer    <token>' or tabs/newlines, potentially causing token extraction to fail or extract wrong data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header format] Can attackers bypass validation by using lowercase 'bearer <token>' instead of 'Bearer <token>', or does the code check the scheme case-insensitively as per HTTP standards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token boundaries] If Authorization header contains 'Bearer token1 token2 token3', does nth(1) extract only 'token1', and could this lead to accepting partial tokens or wrong token validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Unicode handling] Can attackers include Unicode whitespace characters (U+00A0, U+2000-U+200B) in the Authorization header to bypass split_whitespace() parsing and inject malicious tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing attack] Does the ListManager.contains() check execute in constant time, or can attackers use timing side-channels to enumerate valid tokens by measuring response times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Information disclosure] Does the error message on line 58-61 leak the exact token attempted, allowing attackers to confirm which tokens are being tested in brute-force attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Race condition] Can concurrent requests cause race conditions in ListManager.contains() if tokens are being reloaded, leading to valid tokens being temporarily rejected or invalid tokens being accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty token] What happens if an attacker provides 'Bearer ' with nothing after, causing auth_token to be an empty string - is this properly rejected or does it match an empty entry in the token list? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token normalization] Are tokens compared with exact string matching including case sensitivity, or could attackers bypass validation using case variations of valid tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [File parsing] Can attackers manipulate the token file to include special entries (like '..', '*', or regex patterns) that cause ListManager to accept unintended tokens during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory exhaustion] If the token file is extremely large (millions of entries), does ListManager.new() cause excessive memory consumption leading to DoS when loading the HashSet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization failure] If ListManager.new() fails during construction, is there proper error handling to prevent the checker from being created in an invalid state that accepts all tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [File reload] Since tokens are loaded once at startup, is there a mechanism to reload tokens, and if manually reloaded, could this cause race conditions with ongoing check() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Hash collision] Could attackers craft tokens that hash to the same value as valid tokens in the HashSet, allowing unauthorized access through hash collision attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Parameter misuse] The _dry_run parameter is not used in this checker - could this lead to inconsistent behavior where dry_run mode in other checkers conflicts with this checker's validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Logic gap] Since dry_run is ignored, does this mean token validation always happens even in is_eligible endpoint checks, potentially leaking information about valid tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: cost()] [Checker ordering] The cost() returns 2, but is this appropriate for an authentication checker that should run early, or could malicious actors exploit expensive checks running before authentication? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: cost()] [Execution order] If this checker runs after resource-intensive checkers, can attackers consume resources with invalid tokens before being rejected, enabling resource exhaustion DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header manipulation] Can attackers provide multiple Authorization headers to confuse the parsing logic, where data.headers.get(AUTHORIZATION) returns only the first occurrence? (Medium)"
