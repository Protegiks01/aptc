  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Field: distribute_rewards_events] Can distribute_rewards_events be emitted without actual reward distribution occurring, causing off-chain indexers to show inflated validator performance and attracting delegator stake based on false data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Field: add_stake_events] Can add_stake_events be emitted with amount_added exceeding u64::MAX through manipulation, causing event stream consumers to record incorrect stake totals that diverge from actual on-chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Field: withdraw_stake_events] If withdraw_stake_events are emitted but the actual withdrawal fails (e.g., due to timelock), can this cause indexers to show incorrect balances, enabling social engineering attacks on delegators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Field: rotate_consensus_key_events] Can rotate_consensus_key_events be replayed or forged to emit the same old/new key pair multiple times, causing confusion in validator monitoring systems about which key is currently active? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Field: set_operator_events] Can set_operator_events be manipulated to show operator changes that didn't actually occur, enabling phishing attacks where users trust an attacker-displayed operator address? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Deserialization] Can malicious BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization) data be crafted to deserialize a StakePool with inconsistent field values (e.g., pending_inactive > total stake) that bypass Move module validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Deserialization] Does the Deserialize trait implementation validate that EventHandle fields are properly initialized, or can deserialization produce a StakePool with null/invalid event handles that crash the validator when events are emitted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Serialization] Can extremely large values in EventHandle counters cause serialization to fail or produce oversized byte arrays that trigger denial-of-service in network transmission or storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Deserialization] If AccountAddress fields (operator_address, delegated_voter) are deserialized from malformed input, can this produce invalid addresses (e.g., addresses with special meaning in Move) that bypass access control checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: RegisterValidatorCandidateEvent] [Field: pool_address] Can pool_address in RegisterValidatorCandidateEvent be set to an address that doesn't actually contain a stake pool, causing indexers to track non-existent validators and corrupt off-chain validator registries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: SetOperatorEvent] [Fields: old_operator, new_operator] Can old_operator and new_operator be set to the same address in SetOperatorEvent, indicating a no-op operation that should be rejected but might be accepted, enabling event spam? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: AddStakeEvent] [Field: amount_added] Can amount_added in AddStakeEvent be set to zero or u64::MAX, either indicating spurious events or potential overflow attacks when aggregating stake additions across multiple events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: AddStakeEvent] [Field: amount_added] If amount_added is set to a very large value (e.g., u64::MAX - 1) that causes overflow when added to existing stake, will the event still be emitted, creating a mismatch between events and actual state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: ReactivateStakeEvent] [Field: amount] Can the amount field in ReactivateStakeEvent exceed the inactive stake available in the pool, indicating that the event was emitted for an invalid operation that should have been rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: RotateConsensusKeyEvent] [Fields: old_consensus_pubkey, new_consensus_pubkey] Can old_consensus_pubkey and new_consensus_pubkey in RotateConsensusKeyEvent be identical, indicating a spurious key rotation that wastes gas and could be used to spam the event log? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: RotateConsensusKeyEvent] [Fields: old_consensus_pubkey, new_consensus_pubkey] Are the Vec<u8> fields for consensus public keys validated for length and format, or can arbitrary byte arrays be emitted that crash validators attempting to parse them as BLS keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: UpdateNetworkAndFullnodeAddressesEvent] [Fields: old_network_addresses, new_network_addresses] Can the network address Vec<u8> fields contain malformed or oversized data that causes validators to crash when attempting to parse and connect to peer addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: UpdateNetworkAndFullnodeAddressesEvent] [Fields: old_fullnode_addresses, new_fullnode_addresses] Can fullnode address fields be set to attacker-controlled addresses that redirect full node connections to malicious nodes, enabling eclipse attacks on clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: IncreaseLockupEvent] [Fields: old_locked_until_secs, new_locked_until_secs] Can new_locked_until_secs be less than old_locked_until_secs in IncreaseLockupEvent, indicating that lockup was actually decreased rather than increased, violating the semantic meaning of the event? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: IncreaseLockupEvent] [Fields: old_locked_until_secs, new_locked_until_secs] If new_locked_until_secs is set to u64::MAX, does this permanently lock the stake in a way that prevents withdrawal even after the heat death of the universe, effectively burning the funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: DistributeRewardsEvent] [Field: rewards_amount] Can rewards_amount in DistributeRewardsEvent be set to exceed the actual inflation cap or available rewards pool, indicating reward calculation errors that could inflate the token supply? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: DistributeRewardsEvent] [Field: rewards_amount] If rewards_amount is u64::MAX or very large, can adding this to the active stake field cause overflow, making the event indicate a reward distribution that actually causes stake loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: UnlockStakeEvent] [Field: amount_unlocked] Can amount_unlocked exceed the active stake in the pool, indicating that the unlock operation violated invariants and more stake was unlocked than should be possible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: WithdrawStakeEvent] [Field: amount_withdrawn] Can amount_withdrawn be greater than pending_inactive + inactive, suggesting that the withdrawal bypassed lockup checks and withdrew active or pending_active stake prematurely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: LeaveValidatorSetEvent] [Field: pool_address] Can LeaveValidatorSetEvent be emitted for a pool_address that is still in the active validator set, indicating incomplete state transitions that leave the validator in an inconsistent state? (High)"
