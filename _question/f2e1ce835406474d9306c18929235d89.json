  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Graceful Shutdown] No explicit shutdown handling is shown - can server shutdown leave partial transactions or corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Resource Cleanup] When futures complete unexpectedly, are all resources (sockets, file handles, memory) properly cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Zombie Tasks] If periodic tasks are spawned but server exits, can they continue running as zombie processes consuming resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Struct: MintFunderConfig] [Chain ID Validation] At line 283, ChainId is configurable - can attackers trick the faucet into signing transactions for wrong chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [Gas Price Manipulation] At line 289, gas_unit_price_override is None by default - can network congestion cause transactions to fail, locking up faucet funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [Max Gas Amount] At line 290, max_gas_amount is 500,000 - is this sufficient for all transaction types, or can complex transactions fail midway? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: test_mint_funder()] [Transaction Success Verification] At line 858, transaction success is checked via success() method - can transactions appear successful but have partial state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: get_fund_request()] [Address Validation] When address is provided as String, is it properly validated to prevent invalid addresses causing transaction failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: test_transfer_health()] [Production Faucet Dependency] At line 736, test depends on production devnet faucet - can this create circular dependencies or test failures affecting production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Struct: HandlerConfig] [Early Return Logic] At line 47, return_rejections_early flag affects checker execution - can this be exploited to avoid detection by expensive security checkers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Checker Cost Exploitation] Checkers are sorted by cost - can an attacker craft requests that pass low-cost checkers but fail expensive ones, wasting resources? (Medium)"
