(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: asset_uri] [SQL Injection] Does the asset_uri String field validate and sanitize URIs before database operations, or can attackers inject malicious SQL through crafted URIs with SQL metacharacters in query string parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Diesel Primary Key] [Key Collision] Can attackers craft colliding composite primary keys by exploiting case sensitivity, Unicode normalization, or whitespace handling differences between Rust strings and PostgreSQL VARCHAR, causing data corruption or unauthorized overwrites? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: status_code] [Integer Overflow] The status_code field is i64, but HTTP status codes are u16 - can casting from i64 to u16 cause integer overflow or underflow when negative values or values > 65535 are stored, leading to incorrect status interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: status_code] [Type Coercion] Can attackers manipulate the i64 status_code field to store invalid HTTP status codes (negative numbers, or > 599) that bypass validation logic expecting standard HTTP status ranges, causing undefined behavior in status checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: num_failures] [Integer Overflow] Can the num_failures i64 field overflow through repeated failure increments, wrapping to negative values and bypassing retry limit checks, allowing infinite retries or incorrect failure tracking?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: num_failures] [Negative Value Attack] Can attackers directly insert negative values into num_failures through malicious database updates, causing logic errors in retry mechanisms that check 'num_failures < threshold' conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: asset_uri] [URI Validation] Does the asset_uri String field validate URI format, length, and scheme before storage, or can attackers store arbitrarily long URIs causing buffer overflows, or malicious schemes (javascript:, data:, file:) enabling XSS or SSRF attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: asset_uri] [Path Traversal] Can the asset_uri contain path traversal sequences (../, ..\\, %2e%2e/) that when processed by downstream systems lead to unauthorized file access or directory traversal attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: asset_uri] [SSRF Attack] Can attackers store internal network URIs (http://localhost, http://169.254.169.254, http://internal-service) in asset_uri that trigger Server-Side Request Forgery when the crawler attempts to fetch metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: cdn_image_uri] [CDN Hijacking] Can attackers manipulate the cdn_image_uri Optional field to point to malicious CDN endpoints, enabling content poisoning attacks or redirect users to phishing sites when NFT images are displayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: cdn_image_uri] [URL Validation] Does cdn_image_uri validate that stored CDN URLs match expected Cloudflare domain patterns, or can attackers store arbitrary URLs bypassing CDN integrity checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [Information Disclosure] Can the error_messages array leak sensitive system information (stack traces, file paths, database connection strings, internal IPs) when Cloudflare API errors are stored directly without sanitization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [Array Injection] The error_messages field is Option<Vec<Option<String>>> with nested nullability - can attackers inject malicious payloads or excessively long error strings causing memory exhaustion or log injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [XSS via Errors] When error_messages are displayed in web interfaces, are they properly HTML-escaped, or can attackers inject JavaScript code through crafted error messages containing <script> tags or event handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [Unbounded Array] Does the error_messages Vec have size limits enforced, or can attackers cause memory exhaustion by triggering thousands of failures that each append error messages, growing the array unbounded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: request_received_at] [Time Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate the request_received_at timestamp through direct database writes or timezone confusion attacks to bypass rate limiting or reorder request processing queues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: inserted_at] [Race Condition] The inserted_at timestamp is auto-generated but included in the struct - can race conditions between concurrent inserts cause timestamp collisions or incorrect ordering in the processing queue?
