  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Struct: OrderedBlockStore] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker exploit the unbounded BTreeMap storage at line 28 to cause memory exhaustion by inserting blocks with maximum epoch/round values, bypassing the max_num_pending_blocks limit through epoch manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Struct: OrderedBlockStore] [State inconsistency] Does the dual storage of highest_committed_epoch_round (line 24) and ordered_blocks (line 28) create race conditions where commits are acknowledged but blocks remain in storage, causing state desynchronization across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Struct: OrderedBlockStore] [Key collision] Can a malicious validator craft blocks with identical (epoch, round) tuples at line 28 to overwrite legitimate blocks in the BTreeMap, causing consensus divergence or block loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Struct: OrderedBlockStore] [Denial of service] Does the lack of individual block size validation in the ordered_blocks field (line 28) allow attackers to insert enormous blocks that pass the count limit but cause OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Struct: OrderedBlockStore] [Consensus bypass] Can the Optional highest_committed_epoch_round field (line 24) remain None indefinitely in certain edge cases, causing validation failures or allowing replay of old committed blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration bypass] Does the constructor at line 32 validate that max_num_pending_blocks is non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can zero/extreme values cause division-by-zero or immediate block rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: new()] [State initialization] Does initializing highest_committed_epoch_round to None at line 35 create vulnerabilities during the first block insertion where validators accept arbitrarily old blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration tampering] Can a malicious node modify consensus_observer_config after instantiation to bypass block limits, since the config is stored directly without validation at line 34? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: clear_all_ordered_blocks()] [State corruption] Does calling clear_all_ordered_blocks() at line 42 without also resetting highest_committed_epoch_round create an inconsistent state where committed tracking exists but no blocks remain? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: clear_all_ordered_blocks()] [Consensus halt] Can an attacker trigger clear_all_ordered_blocks() during critical consensus phases to cause loss of unprocessed blocks, halting consensus progress or causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: clear_all_ordered_blocks()] [Memory leak] Does the clear() operation at line 42 properly drop all Arc references within ObservedOrderedBlock, or can reference cycles cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: clear_all_ordered_blocks()] [Race condition] If clear_all_ordered_blocks() is called concurrently with insert_ordered_block(), can it cause partial clears leaving the BTreeMap in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_all_ordered_blocks()] [Performance DoS] Does the clone() operation at line 49 allow attackers to trigger expensive deep copies of large block collections, causing CPU/memory exhaustion on validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_all_ordered_blocks()] [Information leak] Can calling get_all_ordered_blocks() expose uncommitted blocks to unauthorized observers, leaking consensus state before finalization? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_all_ordered_blocks()] [TOCTOU race] Does the snapshot at line 49 create time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities where returned blocks become stale immediately, causing validation errors in consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_all_ordered_blocks()] [Memory amplification] Can repeated calls to get_all_ordered_blocks() by multiple threads cause exponential memory growth through simultaneous cloning operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_highest_committed_epoch_round()] [Replay attack] Does returning None from line 54 allow attackers to replay ancient blocks when no commits have occurred, bypassing freshness checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_highest_committed_epoch_round()] [Epoch rollback] Can the returned tuple at line 54 be manipulated during epoch transitions to report lower epochs, enabling epoch rollback attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/ordered_blocks.rs] [Function: get_highest_committed_epoch_round()] [Stale data] Does the lack of timestamp information in the returned value allow validators to accept commits from arbitrarily old epochs? (Medium)",
