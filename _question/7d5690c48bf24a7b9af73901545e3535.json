  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Endianness] Does the serialization format specify byte order, or can big-endian vs little-endian confusion cause parameters to deserialize incorrectly on different platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Version compatibility] If the encryption_elgamal::g1::PUBLIC_PARAMS_NUM_BYTES constant changes in future versions, will old serialized parameters still deserialize correctly or cause breaking errors?
