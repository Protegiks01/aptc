  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 28-44] [Command Enum Exhaustiveness] Does the Command enum match handle all possible command variants, or can future additions without updating run() method cause unhandled command execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 88-107] [BackupType Enum Security] In BackupType enum, do all variants properly initialize their storage fields, or can uninitialized storage in some variants cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 228-234] [Cache Sync Race] In cache::sync_and_load(), if metadata is modified during sync operation, can race conditions cause view.get_storage_state() to return inconsistent or partially updated state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 228-234] [Cache Poisoning Persistence] If an attacker poisons the metadata cache, does the poisoned data persist across multiple invocations, allowing sustained attacks on backup operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 228-234] [Cache Invalidation] Does cache::sync_and_load() properly invalidate stale cache entries, or can old metadata cause backups to be taken of outdated state snapshots? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 231, 242] [Download Limit Bypass] Can concurrent_downloads.get() return values that bypass intended download limits, allowing download exhaustion attacks on backup storage or network bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 231, 242] [Zero Download Deadlock] When concurrent_downloads.get() returns 0, does this cause deadlock in operations requiring at least one download thread, halting backup/restore operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 231, 242] [Excessive Parallelism] Can concurrent_downloads be set to extreme values (e.g., u64::MAX) that spawn excessive download tasks, causing resource exhaustion and node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 163-165] [Path Traversal] In output_transaction_analysis Option<PathBuf>, does verification properly validate the output path to prevent writing analysis files outside intended directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 163-165] [Output File Overwrite] Can output_transaction_analysis path be set to overwrite critical system files or existing backup data, causing data loss or system compromise? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 163-165] [Symlink Attack] If output_transaction_analysis points to a symbolic link, does the verification follow the link, potentially writing sensitive transaction analysis to attacker-controlled locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 78, 112] [Global Option Inheritance] Do GlobalBackupOpt settings properly propagate to all backup controllers, or can mismatched global options cause controllers to operate with different security configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 78, 112] [Global Option Override] Can command-specific options override GlobalBackupOpt security settings, potentially weakening authentication or encryption requirements? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 129, 241] [Waypoint Validation] Does TrustedWaypointOpt validation ensure waypoints are cryptographically signed and chain to genesis, or can attacker-provided waypoints be accepted without validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 129, 241] [Waypoint Rollback] Can an attacker provide old waypoints that cause verification to accept outdated backup state, enabling rollback attacks on the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 129, 241] [Multiple Waypoint Confusion] When TrustedWaypointOpt contains multiple waypoints, is there proper ordering and conflict resolution, or can conflicting waypoints cause verification inconsistencies? (High)",
