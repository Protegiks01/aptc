  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: AggregateSignatureWithRounds::get_voters_and_rounds()] [Vector cloning] Does cloning the entire rounds vector at line 387 for every query cause performance degradation in high-throughput scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Struct: PartialSignaturesWithRound] [Signature storage] Can the BTreeMap storage at line 290 grow unbounded if validators continually send new timeout messages, causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutWithPartialSignatures::signers()] [Iterator safety] Does the signers iterator properly handle concurrent modification of the underlying signatures map? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Struct: TwoChainTimeout] [Network message size] Can malicious validators create timeouts with embedded QCs that are gigabytes in size to cause network bandwidth exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Struct: TwoChainTimeoutCertificate] [Propagation attack] Can Byzantine validators create valid timeout certificates and selectively share them with only some honest validators to partition the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutWithPartialSignatures::add()] [Message ordering] Does add() handle out-of-order delivery of timeout messages correctly, or can message reordering cause incorrect HQC selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutCertificate::verify()] [Verification caching] Is verification result cached, or can attackers force repeated expensive verification of the same timeout certificate? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeout::sign()] [Key management] Does the signing process ensure the ValidatorSigner has the correct key for the current epoch, or can old keys be used to sign timeout messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/timeout_2chain.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutWithPartialSignatures::aggregate_signatures()] [Aggregate security] Does BLS signature aggregation properly handle the case where some signatures are on different messages due to Byzantine behavior?
