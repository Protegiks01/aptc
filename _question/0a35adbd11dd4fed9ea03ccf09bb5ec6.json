  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Async Cancellation] If the async send_rpc() task is cancelled mid-execution, can this leave partial DKG state or orphaned network connections, breaking subsequent DKG ceremonies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: RPC] [Protocol Mismatch] Can validators negotiate different RPC protocols (DKGRpcCompressed vs DKGRpcBcs vs DKGRpcJson) causing serialization inconsistencies in DKG transcript data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: DIRECT_SEND] [Protocol Confusion] Are DIRECT_SEND protocols properly separated from RPC protocols, or can confusion between them cause DKG messages to be sent via wrong protocol breaking request-response semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: RPC] [Protocol Enumeration] With three different RPC protocol variants, can an attacker cause protocol downgrade by forcing use of less efficient/secure Json encoding over Compressed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol Selection Logic] How does to_bytes_by_protocol() select which protocol to use per peer - can Byzantine validators manipulate this to cause heterogeneous encoding across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Replay Attack] Does send_rpc() include any replay protection mechanism (nonces, timestamps), or can a Byzantine validator replay old DKG transcript requests causing validators to re-send transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Message Ordering] Can out-of-order delivery of DKG messages cause validators to process TranscriptResponse before TranscriptRequest, breaking DKG state machine logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw Replay] Does send_rpc_raw() allow replay of raw byte messages, enabling attackers to replay malicious payloads that were previously rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Deterministic Serialization] Are the byte representations produced by to_bytes_by_protocol() deterministic, or can non-determinism cause validators to generate different hashes/signatures for the same DKG message? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Selective Message Drop] Can a Byzantine validator selectively fail send_rpc() calls to specific honest validators while succeeding for others, partitioning the DKG participant set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Asymmetric Network View] If network_client has different connectivity to different validators, can this cause asymmetric DKG transcript collection where some validators have complete transcripts while others don't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Partial Serialization Failure] If to_bytes_by_protocol() fails for a subset of peers in the vector, are the successful serializations rolled back, or do some peers receive messages while others don't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate latency measurements to always be sorted first, gaining unfair advantage in leader selection or message processing priority? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Byzantine Latency] Does sort_peers_by_latency() handle Byzantine validators that report fake latency metrics, or can they bias peer ordering to favor malicious nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker send extremely large DKGMessage payloads causing memory exhaustion when send_rpc() buffers the entire message before transmission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw Bytes Size] Does send_rpc_raw() enforce size limits on the Bytes parameter, or can attackers send gigabyte-sized payloads causing memory DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Batch Serialization DoS] Can providing a massive peers vector (thousands of PeerIds) to to_bytes_by_protocol() cause memory/CPU exhaustion during serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent Request Limit] Is there a limit on concurrent send_rpc() calls, or can an attacker spawn thousands of RPC requests causing connection pool exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Error Propagation] Does send_rpc() properly propagate all error types from the underlying network_client, or can certain errors be silently swallowed causing DKG to hang? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization Panic] Can malformed DKGMessage values cause to_bytes_by_protocol() to panic during serialization, crashing the DKG process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [HashMap Conversion] The conversion from PeerNetworkId to PeerId in the HashMap could lose data if multiple PeerNetworkIds map to same PeerId - can this cause transcript loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Deserialization Error] When send_rpc_raw() receives a response, what happens if the response cannot be deserialized to DKGMessage - does it crash or return an error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Empty Slice] What happens if sort_peers_by_latency() is called with an empty slice - does it handle this gracefully or cause index out of bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Struct: DKGNetworkClient] [Generic Constraint] The NetworkClient generic is constrained to NetworkClientInterface<DKGMessage> - can type confusion allow substitution with incompatible network client implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization Safety] Does the new() constructor validate the provided network_client, or can an uninitialized/corrupted network client be wrapped causing crashes? (Medium)"
