  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric: network_handler_timer] [Performance masking] Can a validator deliberately record normal timing metrics while actually delaying consensus messages, hiding its Byzantine behavior from performance monitoring and slashing detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Labels: node_addr, name] [Identity spoofing] Can attackers record metrics with spoofed node_addr labels to frame honest validators as slow performers, potentially triggering false slashing penalties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric: network_handler_timer] [Storage exhaustion] If metrics are persisted to disk or exported to monitoring systems, can unbounded metric accumulation from high-frequency network operations exhaust storage and crash the node? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Static: NETWORK_HANDLER_TIMER] [Memory leak] Is there proper cleanup of histogram data, or can long-running validators accumulate unbounded metric observations in memory, eventually causing OOM conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric: network_handler_timer] [CPU exhaustion] Can extremely high-frequency metric recording (millions of observations per second) during network attacks consume CPU resources needed for consensus message processing, degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric: network_handler_timer] [Missing validation] Are callers of this metric required to validate timing measurements, or can negative, zero, or extremely large duration values corrupt histogram buckets and cause incorrect performance analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Labels: node_addr, name] [Inconsistent labeling] If different parts of the codebase use inconsistent label values for the same logical operations, can this fragment metrics data and make Byzantine behavior detection impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric purpose] [Monitoring gap] Does this single metric provide sufficient granularity to detect sophisticated timing attacks where Byzantine nodes selectively delay specific message types while appearing normal overall? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Metric: network_handler_timer] [Production exposure] Are these metrics exposed on public endpoints in production deployments, allowing external attackers to gather real-time performance intelligence to plan targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/metrics.rs] [Static initialization] [Configuration hardening] Are the bucket parameters (1e-3, 2.0, 20) hardcoded and immutable, or can they be modified through configuration injection to break monitoring and hide malicious behavior? (Low)"
