  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Struct: JellyfishMerkleIterator] [Thread safety] The iterator holds an Arc<R> reader at line 100 - if the iterator is shared across threads (sent via channels), can concurrent access to parent_stack cause data races even though Arc provides thread safety for the reader? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Struct: JellyfishMerkleIterator] [Version consistency] At line 103, the version is stored and used throughout iteration - can an attacker cause the underlying storage to be modified for this version during iteration, causing inconsistent reads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Struct: JellyfishMerkleIterator] [Parent stack exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a tree that causes parent_stack to grow unboundedly, consuming excessive memory and causing OOM conditions on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [State root mismatch] If the iterator reads from a Merkle tree with an inconsistent or corrupted state root, can it iterate over entries that don't match the committed state root, causing validators to execute transactions based on wrong state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [Concurrent modifications] If the tree is modified while an iterator is active (new version created), can this cause the iterator to read a mix of old and new state, violating snapshot isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [Key ordering] The iterator relies on keys being properly ordered (using NibblePath) - can hash collisions or malicious keys with specific bit patterns cause incorrect ordering and skip entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [TreeReader errors] Throughout the file, TreeReader::get_node() is called - can malicious or buggy TreeReader implementations return inconsistent results causing the iterator to produce invalid state reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: NodeVisitInfo::new()] [Bitmap edge case] If children_bitmap is 0x0001 (only LSB set), trailing_zeros() returns 0 and next_child_to_visit becomes 1 - can this edge case cause issues when combined with other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: NodeVisitInfo::new()] [Bitmap edge case] If children_bitmap is 0xFFFF (all bits set), what happens when advancing through all 16 children - can the final advance operation cause overflow issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: NodeVisitInfo::is_rightmost()] [Leading zeros edge case] When both values have 0 leading zeros (both are 0x8000 or higher), can the equality check at line 84 give false positives or negatives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: JellyfishMerkleIterator::new()] [Nibble height boundary] At ROOT_NIBBLE_HEIGHT (typically 64 for 256-bit hashes), can edge cases near this boundary cause incorrect tree navigation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: JellyfishMerkleIterator::new_by_index()] [Index boundary] If start_idx is usize::MAX, can this cause overflow in comparisons or arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: JellyfishMerkleIterator::skip_leaves()] [Leaf count overflow] If multiple children each have large leaf counts, can their sum overflow usize when accumulated in leaves_skipped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [General] [Panic safety] Multiple functions use expect(), assert!, and unreachable!() - can any of these be triggered by malicious input or storage corruption to crash validator nodes during critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [General] [Clone operations] InternalNode is cloned at lines 139 and 245 - are these clones deep copies, and can large nodes cause excessive memory consumption leading to DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [General] [Error propagation] The ? operator is used throughout for error propagation - can partial state modifications occur before errors are returned, leaving the iterator in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [General] [Borrowed references] Functions like skip_leaves() return references into internal_node - can lifetime issues or use-after-free occur if the caller doesn't handle these properly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [General] [Non-deterministic iteration] If different validators have slightly different tree structures due to storage issues, can the iterator produce different sequences of key-value pairs, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: Iterator::next()] [Ordering guarantee] The iterator should return keys in sorted order - can any code path cause keys to be returned out of order, breaking assumptions of code that uses this iterator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: JellyfishMerkleIterator::new()] [Starting position] If two validators call new() with the same starting_key but slightly different tree states, can they begin iteration at different positions, causing divergent state reads?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Function: Iterator::next()] [Slow iteration] Can an attacker craft a tree structure that causes next() to require many storage reads and loop iterations per call, slowing down state queries and affecting validator performance?
