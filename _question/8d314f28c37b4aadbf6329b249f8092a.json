  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Equality Implementation] At line 29, does the derived PartialEq correctly handle all edge cases, or can two semantically different waypoints compare as equal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Hash Implementation] Is there a derived or manual Hash implementation, and does it match PartialEq semantics to prevent HashMap/HashSet corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: version() & value()] [Getter Safety] At lines 54-60, do the simple getter functions expose internal fields that should be immutable but could be modified if Waypoint isn't properly encapsulated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Arbitrary Derive] [Fuzzing Coverage] At line 30, does the proptest Arbitrary implementation generate sufficiently diverse waypoints to find edge cases, including boundary values for version and hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: epoch_change_verification_required()] [Always Verify] Does always requiring epoch change verification (returning true) prevent optimization opportunities and cause unnecessary verification overhead that could be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Verification Order] Should waypoint verification happen before or after signature verification in the overall validation pipeline, and can incorrect ordering be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Immutability] Are waypoints immutable after creation, or can they be modified through unsafe code or other means, potentially invalidating trust assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_any()] [No Validation] At lines 40-46, does new_any() perform ANY validation on the input LedgerInfo, or blindly accept any values including potentially malicious ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Field Validation] At lines 140-148, does the new() function validate that epoch, root_hash, version, timestamp_usecs, and next_epoch_state are within expected bounds or can they be arbitrary values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Side Effects] Does the verify function have any side effects (logging, metrics, state changes) that could be exploited through repeated verification attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Constant: WAYPOINT_DELIMITER] [Delimiter Choice] At line 23, could the ':' delimiter conflict with other formats (URLs, file paths) where waypoints might be used, causing parsing ambiguities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Leading/Trailing Whitespace] Does from_str properly trim or reject waypoint strings with leading/trailing whitespace that could cause confusion in config files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Hash Encoding] At line 104, does to_hex() produce lowercase or uppercase hex, and could case sensitivity issues cause waypoint comparison problems? (Low)"
