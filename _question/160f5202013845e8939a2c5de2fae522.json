  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: maximum_number_of_gas_units] [Liveness attack] Can reducing this parameter to very small values through governance make legitimate complex transactions impossible to execute, effectively halting all DeFi operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_price_per_gas_unit] [Economic attack] The TODO comment at line 59 suggests changing from 0 - if min_price remains 0, can attackers execute transactions without paying any fees by setting gas_price=0? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_price_per_gas_unit] [Validator revenue] Can setting min_price_per_gas_unit too low allow spam transactions that cost validators more to process than they earn in fees, leading to validator attrition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_price_per_gas_unit] [Integer overflow] With max at 10,000,000,000 (line 69), when multiplied by maximum_number_of_gas_units, can this exceed u64::MAX or Fee type maximum, causing overflow in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_price_per_gas_unit] [Economic censorship] Can validators collude to only accept transactions at max_price_per_gas_unit, effectively pricing out normal users and enabling censorship? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameters: min/max gas price] [Range validation] If governance updates set min_price_per_gas_unit > max_price_per_gas_unit, would all transactions become invalid, causing total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_transaction_size_in_bytes] [Limit bypass] Standard limit is 64KB (line 74) but governance transactions get 1MB (line 79) - can attackers abuse governance transaction types to submit oversized payloads without governance authority? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_transaction_size_in_bytes] [Storage bloat] Can repeated maximum-size transactions (64KB each) fill validator disk storage faster than pruning can clear it, eventually causing storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_transaction_size_in_bytes_gov] [Governance privilege escalation] The _gov suffix indicates privileged limit - can non-governance transactions be misclassified to use the 1MB limit, enabling 16x larger payloads than intended? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_transaction_size_in_bytes] [Network amplification] If size limit is increased through governance without corresponding gas price increases, can attackers amplify network bandwidth consumption by 100x with minimal cost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: max_transaction_size_in_bytes] [Version-specific attack] Parameter uses RELEASE_V1_13 versioning (line 78) - can attackers exploit version transition periods where different validators enforce different size limits, causing consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: storage_io_per_state_slot_read] [Gas underpricing] Value 302,385 assumes 'most levels of JMT nodes in cache' (line 90) - can adversaries craft access patterns that force cache misses, consuming more validator resources than gas paid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: storage_io_per_state_slot_read] [State bloat attack] Can attackers create millions of state slots then read them repeatedly to exhaust validator I/O capacity while paying insufficient gas? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: storage_io_per_state_byte_read] [Integer precision] At 151 gas per byte, reading 1MB would cost 151,000,000 gas - can this exceed InternalGas type limits causing overflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: load_data_failure] [Free failure exploit] Set to 0 gas (line 104), meaning failed reads cost nothing - can attackers spam failed reads to probe state structure without cost, enabling state fingerprinting attacks? (Medium)",
