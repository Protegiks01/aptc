  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum file size] Is there a maximum file size check, or can arbitrarily large bytecode files (e.g., 10GB) be loaded into memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Edge case] [Line number at u16::MAX] If a user scrolls to line 65,535 (u16::MAX), can the bound_line() arithmetic cause integer overflow? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Edge case] [Line ending inconsistency] If bytecode_text is split by \\\\n but source code uses \\\\r\\\\n, can this cause line number mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Performance] [Repeated cloning] Every redraw clones all bytecode_text strings - can rapid scrolling cause CPU exhaustion or lag? (Low)",
