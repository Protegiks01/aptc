  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/error.rs] [Module: re-exports] [Dependency risk] Does the use of anyhow::Error as the primary error type for crypto operations lose type-safety information that could be critical for distinguishing between different failure modes (e.g., signature verification failure vs. key generation failure vs. malformed input), potentially allowing attackers to exploit error handling paths that treat all errors identically? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/error.rs] [Module: re-exports] [Information leakage] When crypto operations fail and return anyhow::Error with detailed error messages via bail!(), could these error messages leak sensitive cryptographic material, internal state information, or timing details that enable side-channel attacks or provide reconnaissance information to attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/error.rs] [Module: re-exports] [Error propagation] Does the lack of a strongly-typed custom error enum mean that critical cryptographic failures (like signature verification failures in consensus) could be confused with non-critical errors (like formatting errors), allowing Byzantine validators to bypass safety checks by triggering error paths that are incorrectly categorized? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/error.rs] [Module: re-exports] [Type erasure] Since anyhow::Error uses type erasure via dynamic dispatch, could this prevent proper error matching in critical consensus or validation code, where distinguishing between recoverable and irrecoverable errors is essential for maintaining safety and liveness guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/error.rs] [Module: re-exports] [Dependency security] Is the anyhow crate version pinned and audited, or could a compromised/malicious version of anyhow be introduced that manipulates error handling behavior in cryptographic operations, potentially suppressing signature verification failures or causing validators to accept invalid cryptographic proofs? (Critical)"
