  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Field: allow_overwrite] [Flag inconsistency] Can allow_overwrite be changed after construction, or is it immutable? If mutable, could concurrent threads observe different flag values causing inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Field: allow_overwrite] [Test/production mismatch] Is allow_overwrite=true only used in tests, or can production code accidentally enable it, allowing state corruption by permitting duplicate node insertions? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Field: allow_overwrite] [Overwrite without tracking] When allow_overwrite is true, does write_node_batch() at line 62 discard the old node without marking it stale, causing memory leaks and preventing proper pruning? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Field: allow_overwrite] [Silent corruption] Can allow_overwrite=true mask critical bugs by silently replacing nodes that should never be duplicated, hiding state corruption until production deployment? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Implementation: Default] [Flag default] Does defaulting allow_overwrite to false at line 22 prevent legitimate use cases where overwrites are needed, or is this the correct security-first default? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Implementation: Default] [Empty initialization] Can calling Default::default() and immediately using the store without proper initialization cause panics in downstream operations expecting certain invariants? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor validation] Does new(allow_overwrite=true) bypass critical validation that Default provides, allowing creation of stores with dangerous configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Cross-function] [Write-read race] Can write_tree_update_batch() insert nodes that get_rightmost_leaf() immediately returns before stale indices are processed, causing rightmost leaf queries to return soon-to-be-stale nodes? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Cross-function] [Purge during read] Can purge_stale_nodes() delete a node that get_node_option() has already looked up but not yet cloned, returning None when the node should exist? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Cross-function] [Batch vs single] Can interleaved calls to write_node_batch() and put_node() violate the assert_eq! at line 64, even though both are legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Cross-function] [Stale index orphan] If write_tree_update_batch() fails after inserting nodes but before adding stale indices, can orphaned nodes accumulate without pruning indices, causing unbounded storage growth? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Cross-function] [Count divergence] Can concurrent purge_stale_nodes() and write_node_batch() operations cause num_nodes() to return counts that never reflect actual stored nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [State consistency] [HashMap-BTreeSet sync] Can the HashMap and BTreeSet in the data tuple fall out of sync if one operation succeeds but its pair fails, causing stale indices to point to non-existent nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [State consistency] [Version ordering] Does MockTreeStore enforce that all nodes at version V are inserted before any nodes at version V+1, or can out-of-order inserts corrupt version-based queries? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [State consistency] [Root node handling] Does MockTreeStore specially validate root nodes (empty nibble path), or can malformed root nodes break the entire tree structure? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [State consistency] [Leaf vs internal] Can Internal nodes be stored with NodeKeys that should contain Leaf nodes, violating Merkle tree structure invariants? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Memory] [Unbounded growth] Can an attacker insert nodes faster than purge_stale_nodes() removes them, causing unbounded HashMap and BTreeSet growth until validators run out of memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Memory] [Clone amplification] Does the clone() operation at line 61 in write_node_batch() and line 46 in get_rightmost_leaf() amplify memory usage, enabling OOM attacks with moderately-sized inputs? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Memory] [Hash collisions] Can deliberately crafted NodeKeys with hash collisions degrade HashMap performance to O(n), causing validator slowdowns during node lookups? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Memory] [BTreeSet overhead] Does the BTreeSet at line 14 have significant memory overhead compared to alternatives, unnecessarily consuming validator memory? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Error handling] [Panic propagation] Do the assert_eq! at line 64 and ensure! at lines 94, 128 properly propagate errors, or can panics escape and crash validator processes? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Error handling] [Error types] Are all error returns of type Result<T> properly mapped to AptosDbError, or can type mismatches cause compilation errors in production code? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Error handling] [Context loss] Do error messages at lines 84, 94, 128 provide sufficient context for debugging, or can cryptic errors hide the root cause of state corruption? (Low)",
