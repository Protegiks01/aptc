  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Empty File] If source_code contains an empty string, can operations like slicing and context calculation handle it gracefully or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Zero-Width Span] If loc_start equals loc_end (zero-width location), does the highlight at line 67 become empty, and is this handled correctly by the viewer UI? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Full File Span] If loc covers the entire file, can the context calculation and string allocations handle this without performance issues or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Boundary Alignment] At lines 66-68, if context_start, loc_start, loc_end, and context_end are not properly ordered, can this cause slice panics or reversed ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Index Calculation] At line 36, file_index = source_code.len() - 1 assumes source_code is non-empty after push - but if push somehow fails silently, is this assumption violated? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Min Operation] At line 63, cmp::min() is used to cap context_end - if both arguments are large, can this cause unexpected truncation of the context window? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Loc Type] The Loc type returned from get_code_location() - what are its internal representations (u32, u64, usize), and can conversions cause data loss? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [SourceContext Construction] The SourceContext struct at lines 70-74 - does it perform any validation on the left, highlight, remainder fields, or can invalid states be created? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: backing_string()] [Full Source Exposure] The backing_string() method returns the entire source file - can this unintentionally expose sensitive comments, private functions, or credentials embedded in source files? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Context Leakage] The CONTEXT_SIZE of 1000 characters may reveal more code than intended - can this expose security-sensitive logic or commented-out vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Module Safety] The #![forbid(unsafe_code)] directive at line 5 prevents unsafe blocks - but can safe code still cause memory unsafety through incorrect API usage (unwrap, indexing, slicing)? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Import Safety] The imports at lines 7-14 - can malicious versions of move_binary_format, move_bytecode_source_map, or std modules introduce vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Hard-coded Assumptions] The code assumes source_code vector has exactly one element after construction - if future changes add multiple files, can this break existing functionality? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Constant: CONTEXT_SIZE] [Magic Number] The CONTEXT_SIZE constant is hard-coded to 1000 - should this be configurable to prevent future issues with very large or small values? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Error Cases] Are there tests covering all error paths from get_code_location(), including invalid function indices, out-of-range offsets, and empty source maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Edge Case Testing] Are there tests for empty files, very large files, files with only multi-byte UTF-8 characters, and malformed source maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Unwrap Chain] At line 63, checked_add().unwrap() can panic - should this use saturating_add() or return a Result instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Multiple Unwraps] The function has unwrap() calls at lines 30 and 32 - can these be replaced with proper error handling using Result/Option? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Module-Source Mismatch] If the CompiledModule was compiled from different source than the one provided in source_location, can this create misleading debugging information? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Bytecode-Source Mapping] Can optimizations, code transformations, or obfuscation in the compiler cause bytecode locations to map to incorrect source locations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [File Lock DoS] If the source file is locked by another process during read, does fs::read_to_string block indefinitely or timeout appropriately? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [CPU Exhaustion] Can rapid repeated calls to source_for_code_location() with maximum-size context windows cause CPU exhaustion through excessive string operations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [File Modification] After the file is read and validated, if the file is modified on disk, does this create inconsistency with the in-memory source_code? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Serialization Safety] Can ModuleViewer be serialized/deserialized, and if so, can malicious deserialization bypass the validation in new()? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Module: source_viewer] [Unused Code] The module field is unused - does this indicate incomplete functionality or technical debt that could hide bugs? (Low)"
