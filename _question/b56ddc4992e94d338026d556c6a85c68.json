  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [Struct: NewTransactionOutputsWithProofRequest] [Version Consistency] Does known_version for outputs match the version used for transactions, or can version desynchronization cause state divergence between transaction-syncing and output-syncing nodes?
