  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_error_code_map()] [Output Path Traversal] Can the output_path parameter be exploited to write error maps to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical system files or validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_doc()] [Unchecked Input] Are the sources and dep_paths vectors validated for maximum length, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by providing extremely large file lists? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_error_code_map()] [Information Disclosure] Can verbose error messages in move_prover output expose internal system paths, dependency versions, or other metadata useful for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_doc()] [Log Injection] Can attacker-controlled file names or paths be logged in a way that enables log injection attacks, corrupting audit trails or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_doc()] [Error Suppression] Does the unwrap() on line 107 properly propagate errors, or could failed documentation builds silently mask underlying Move module compilation failures that should halt validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_error_code_map()] [Error Masking] Can errors during error map generation be hidden, causing validators to run with incomplete error descriptions that hamper security incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_files()] [Error Recovery] If find_filenames() encounters permission errors or I/O failures, does the unwrap() cause immediate panic, or should there be graceful degradation to prevent validator downtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Constants: MODULES_DIR, NURSERY_DIR] [Directory Constant Hardening] Can the hardcoded directory names 'sources' and 'nursery' be exploited if an attacker gains write access to the crate root, planting malicious modules in predictable locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Constant: ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS] [Data Integrity] Is the included error_description.errmap file verified with a cryptographic signature or hash, or can tampering with this embedded data cause validators to display misleading error information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Constant: ERRMAP_FILE] [File Inclusion] Can the build system be manipulated to include a malicious .errmap file that exploits parsing vulnerabilities in error map readers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_named_addresses()] [Race Condition] If this function is called concurrently from multiple threads during validator initialization, can race conditions in BTreeMap construction lead to inconsistent address mappings across threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: path_in_crate()] [Thread Safety] Is the PathBuf construction from CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR thread-safe when multiple compilation units call this function simultaneously during parallel builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_doc()] [Concurrent Writes] Can concurrent calls to build_doc() with the same output_path cause file corruption or race conditions in documentation file writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_files()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker create millions of .move files in the sources directory to cause find_filenames() to allocate unbounded memory, triggering OOM crashes on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: error_descriptions()] [Memory Safety] Is the static byte array ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS properly bounds-checked when accessed, or could buffer overruns occur if the included data is malformed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_doc()] [Leak Potential] Does the move_prover invocation properly clean up temporary files and resources, or can repeated calls leak file handles or memory over time? (Low)",
