  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_ACCOUNT_DATA] [Information Disclosure] Does the error message 'can't find account data' reveal too much information about the internal state of the API to potential attackers, allowing them to enumerate valid vs invalid accounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_BALANCE] [Information Disclosure] Can the error 'can't find account balance' be used by malicious actors to differentiate between non-existent accounts and accounts with zero balance, enabling reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_TOKEN_DATA] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing 'can't find token data' provide attackers with information about which token IDs exist vs don't exist, potentially revealing token minting patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_MODULE] [Information Disclosure] Can the 'can't find module' error be exploited to enumerate which Move modules are deployed on specific accounts, revealing contract deployment patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_VERSION] [Information Disclosure] Does the 'can't find transaction version' error leak information about transaction sequencing that could be used to infer network state or timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [Log Injection] Are these string constants properly sanitized when used in logging contexts, or could newline characters in concatenated user input cause log injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [Format String] When these constants are used with format macros in consuming code, could format string vulnerabilities occur if user-controlled data is improperly interpolated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_BAD_BALANCE_STRING] [Input Validation] Does the 'bad balance string' error indicate insufficient validation of balance inputs that could lead to integer overflow or parsing vulnerabilities in balance handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_CREATE_ACCOUNT] [Error Handling] Is the generic 'failed to create account' error message used consistently, or could timing differences or detailed error variations reveal whether account creation failed due to duplicate addresses vs other reasons? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_FUND_ACCOUNT] [Error Handling] Does the 'failed to fund account' message mask the underlying reason (e.g., faucet rate limiting vs insufficient faucet balance), potentially allowing attackers to distinguish between different failure modes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_FINISH_TRANSACTION] [Error Handling] Can the 'failed to finish transaction' error be used to differentiate between transactions that failed execution vs those that timed out, leaking network performance information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_BALANCE] [Test Logic] When 'wrong balance' is used in test assertions, could improper comparison logic in consuming code fail to catch balance manipulation attacks due to integer precision issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_TOKEN_BALANCE] [Test Logic] Does the 'wrong token balance' failure string indicate potential issues with token balance validation that could miss integer overflow in token transfer operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_ACCOUNT_DATA] [Test Logic] Can the 'wrong account data' failure mask critical differences between expected and actual account states, potentially missing authentication key manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constants: CHECK_* step names] [Test Orchestration] Are the check step names used in a way that ensures all security-critical validations run atomically, or could race conditions between steps lead to TOCTOU vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [Constant Integrity] Are these string constants guaranteed to be immutable at runtime, or could memory corruption or unsafe code elsewhere modify them, leading to confusing or misleading error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [String Length] Do any of these string constants exceed reasonable length limits that could cause buffer issues when used in fixed-size logging buffers or UI displays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_CHECK] [Usage Context] When 'persistency check never started' is used in persistent_check.rs, could the default error be returned in cases where actual checks did run but failed, masking the real failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_SERIALIZE] [Serialization] Does the 'failed to serialize' error indicate potential panics or crashes in serialization code that could be triggered by malformed API responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_VIEW] [View Function] Can the 'view function failed' error hide security-critical issues in view function execution, such as unauthorized data access or incorrect state reading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constants: ERROR_NO_* series] [Error Discrimination] Are the 'can't find X' errors distinct enough to differentiate between temporary unavailability vs permanent non-existence, preventing false negatives in tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_MESSAGE] [Message Validation] Does the generic 'wrong message' failure provide sufficient detail to identify whether message content, format, or authentication failed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_MODULE] [Module Validation] Can the 'wrong module' failure distinguish between incorrect module code vs incorrect module metadata, missing potential code injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Step Constants] [Metrics Labeling] Are step name constants used as metrics labels, and could their static nature prevent proper granularity in monitoring security-critical test failures? (Low)",
