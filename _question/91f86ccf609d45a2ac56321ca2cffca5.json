  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Enum: AggregatorChangeV1] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft a transaction that causes type confusion between Write(u128), Merge(DeltaOp), and Delete variants during deserialization, potentially allowing arbitrary state manipulation or bypassing aggregator limits? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Enum: AggregatorChangeV1::Merge] [Delta manipulation] Can a malicious transaction create a DeltaOp with manipulated limit or history fields that bypasses aggregator maximum value checks, allowing unlimited token minting?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: AggregatorChangeSet] [BTreeMap ordering] Do the BTreeMap structures maintain deterministic ordering across all validators, or can different insertion orders cause state divergence and consensus failure?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: AggregatorChangeSet] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker create unbounded growth in the BTreeMaps by generating unique StateKeys or DelayedFieldIDs, causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: NativeAggregatorContext::session_hash] [Hash collision] Can session_hash collisions occur across concurrent transactions, causing state from one transaction to leak into another and breaking transaction isolation?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: NativeAggregatorContext::delayed_field_data] [RefCell panic] Can multiple mutable borrows of delayed_field_data cause RefCell panic at runtime, leading to transaction execution failure and potential loss of liveness?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: NativeAggregatorContext] [Lifetime safety] Are the lifetime bounds on aggregator_v1_resolver and delayed_field_resolver properly enforced, or can use-after-free occur if resolvers are dropped while context is still active?
