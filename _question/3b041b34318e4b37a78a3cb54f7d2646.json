  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: process_account_address()] [Lines: 163-170] [Address Format] The function tries AccountAddress::from_str() at line 165 - does this support all valid address formats (0x prefix optional, padded vs unpadded, etc.), or could valid addresses be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: process_account_address()] [Lines: 163-170] [Empty String] What happens if an empty string (after trim) is passed to this function - does AccountAddress::from_str() handle it gracefully with an error, or does it panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: process_account_address()] [Lines: 163-170] [Address Validation] After successfully parsing the address, is there any validation that it's not a reserved system address (0x0, 0x1, etc.) that should not receive faucet funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: process_account_address()] [Lines: 163-170] [Unicode Handling] If the input contains Unicode characters or null bytes, does from_str() handle them correctly, or could they bypass validation and cause issues downstream? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Overall] [Race Condition] If multiple instances of this CLI are run concurrently with the same key_file_path, could they interfere with each other's sequence numbers, causing transaction failures and account state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 103-107] [RwLock Contention] The RwLock wrapping faucet_account at line 106 - in a concurrent scenario, could write lock contention cause some transactions to be delayed or fail due to lock timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 122-131] [Async Race] Between use_delegated_account() and update_asset_account(), if another async operation accesses the original account, could this cause a race condition with inconsistent account state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 74-80] [Key Derivation] The Ed25519PublicKey::from(&key) derivation at line 76 - is this using secure cryptographic libraries, or could weak implementations allow key recovery from public keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 74-80] [Authentication Key] The AuthenticationKey::ed25519() call at line 76 - does this use a secure hash function for deriving the authentication key, or could collisions enable address spoofing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Line: 71] [Key Storage] After get_key() loads the private key, is it stored securely in memory with proper zeroing after use, or could it remain in memory and be extracted through memory dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 141-144] [Replay Attack] Are there any replay protection mechanisms beyond sequence numbers, such as transaction expiration timestamps or chain ID validation, to prevent replay attacks if transactions are intercepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 83-92] [Transaction Ordering] With transaction_expiration_secs set to 25 seconds and wait_for_outstanding_txns_secs at 30 seconds, could transaction ordering issues arise where newer transactions are processed before older ones expire? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 141-156] [Partial Success] If minting to multiple accounts and some transactions succeed while others fail, is there a mechanism to retry only the failed ones without re-minting to successful accounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 122-125] [Delegation Failure] If use_delegated_account() fails, does the .context() provide enough information to debug the issue, or could vague error messages hide critical security problems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 128-131] [Update Failure] If update_asset_account() fails after successful delegation, could this leave the system with a delegated account that has mint capabilities but isn't being used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Line: 158] [Final Ok()] The function returns Ok(()) at line 158 even if some minting operations failed - should it return an error to indicate partial failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 83-92] [Gas Depletion] If the faucet account runs out of gas funds for paying transaction fees, do subsequent transactions fail gracefully with clear error messages, or could they cause sequence number issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 141-156] [Gas Consumption Attack] Can an attacker specify many small-value mints to waste the faucet's gas budget on transaction fees rather than actually distributing meaningful amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Struct: FaucetCliArgs] [Field: amount] [Precision Loss] Since amount is specified in OCTA (smallest unit), can there be precision loss or rounding errors when converting to larger units during transaction processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/cli/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Lines: 110-119] [API Version] Is there any validation that the node_url points to a compatible API version, or could API version mismatches cause silent failures or incorrect transaction formats?
