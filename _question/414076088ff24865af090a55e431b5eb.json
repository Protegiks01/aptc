  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Missing validation] Does the ExecutedChunk struct enforce any validation that the output field's PartialStateComputeResult is in a valid/complete state before being used in the commit pipeline, or can malformed execution outputs cause state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [State inconsistency] Can an ExecutedChunk be constructed with a PartialStateComputeResult that has incomplete OnceCell fields (state_checkpoint_output or ledger_update_output unset), leading to panics or state corruption during commit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Epoch boundary attack] Can an attacker craft an ExecutedChunk with ledger_info_opt set for a non-epoch-ending chunk, or vice versa, causing consensus confusion and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Signature forgery] Does the optional ledger_info_opt field validate that LedgerInfoWithSignatures contains sufficient validator signatures (>2/3 stake), or can chunks with insufficient signatures be committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Version mismatch] Can the output.execution_output and ledger_info_opt reference mismatched versions or state roots, causing validators to commit divergent states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Double construction] Can an ExecutedChunk be constructed multiple times from the same PartialStateComputeResult, potentially allowing duplicate commits or state replay? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Ownership violation] Since ExecutedChunk takes ownership of PartialStateComputeResult and LedgerInfoWithSignatures, can there be use-after-move bugs where these fields are accessed after the chunk is consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Clone safety] Does ExecutedChunk implement Clone, and if so, can cloning cause issues with the OnceCell semantics in PartialStateComputeResult where cells should only be set once? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Debug trait leak] Since ExecutedChunk derives Debug, could sensitive cryptographic material or validator signatures in ledger_info_opt be inadvertently logged, creating security risks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Pipeline ordering] In the two-stage commit pipeline, can ExecutedChunk instances be processed out-of-order in the to_commit queue, causing non-sequential version commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Queue corruption] Can concurrent access to ExecutedChunk in ChunkCommitQueue's VecDeque lead to chunks being dequeued before they're fully processed, resulting in incomplete commits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Option unwrapping] When ExecutedChunk is stored as Option<ExecutedChunk> in the queue and taken via take(), can race conditions cause multiple threads to attempt to take() the same chunk? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Memory leak] If an ExecutedChunk in the commit queue is never dequeued (e.g., due to error), could this cause unbounded memory growth and resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: ledger_info_opt] [Reconfiguration bypass] Can ledger_info_opt be Some() for non-reconfig chunks, allowing attackers to trigger premature epoch changes and validator set manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: ledger_info_opt] [Missing quorum] Does the system validate that ledger_info_opt contains valid quorum certificates before committing epoch-ending chunks, or can invalid QCs cause consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: ledger_info_opt] [Replay attack] Can an old LedgerInfoWithSignatures from a previous epoch be reused in ledger_info_opt to cause rollback or state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: ledger_info_opt] [Timestamp manipulation] If ledger_info_opt is present, are the timestamps validated to be monotonically increasing, or can time-travel attacks succeed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: ledger_info_opt] [Validator signature] Does the system verify that signatures in ledger_info_opt come from the correct validator set for the current epoch, preventing signature reuse across epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: output] [Incomplete computation] Can output.execution_output have next_epoch_state set without a corresponding ledger_info_opt, creating epoch transition inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: output] [State root mismatch] If output's state_checkpoint_output and ledger_update_output produce different state roots, which one is used for commitment, and can this cause divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: output] [Transaction count] Can output.execution_output.num_transactions_to_commit() return 0 for a chunk with ledger_info_opt=Some(), potentially committing empty epoch-ending blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: output] [OnceCell panic] Since output contains OnceCell fields that panic on double-set, can concurrent or repeated processing of an ExecutedChunk cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Field: output] [Result completeness] Does the system verify that output.get_complete_result() returns Some before committing, or can incomplete results be persisted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Send/Sync safety] Is ExecutedChunk properly Send+Sync for multi-threaded environments, or can shared access to output's OnceCell cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Mutex contention] When ExecutedChunk is accessed through ChunkCommitQueue's Mutex, can lock contention or deadlocks prevent timely commits and affect liveness? (Medium)"
