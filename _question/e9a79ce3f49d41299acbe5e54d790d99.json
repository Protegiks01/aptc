  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Invariant: max_weight >= min_weight] Could corrupted state violate this? Would it break reconstruction logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Invariant: sum(weights) == tc.get_total_num_shares()] If this is violated, reconstruction will fail. Is it checked anywhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [All Functions] [Invariant Preservation] Are all functions that modify or create WeightedConfig instances guaranteed to maintain all invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Integration: ThresholdConfig] If TC::new() at line 85 has bugs, could invalid ThresholdConfig instances be embedded in WeightedConfig? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Integration: Player] Are Player IDs validated by the Player struct, or could invalid IDs bypass validation and cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Integration: ShamirShare] Could malformed ShamirShare objects in reconstruct() bypass cryptographic validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Integration: EvaluationDomain] Could mismatched evaluation domain sizes between WeightedConfig and PVSS transcript cause decryption failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Propagation] The anyhow::Result errors at lines 58 and 64 are generic. Could callers properly distinguish between different failure modes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Error Handling] Does reconstruct() return detailed error information when it fails, or could silent failures occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_share_index()] [None Handling] Callers of get_share_index() must handle None. Could missing checks cause unwrap panics elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: sort_players_by_weight()] [Non-Deterministic Sorting] If the sort is unstable and players have equal weights, could validators produce different orderings causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [RNG Determinism] Must all validators use the same RNG seed? If not, they'll select different subsets and fail to reconstruct. (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Iteration Order] Does the iteration order over shares at line 361 need to be deterministic? Could different orders produce different results? (High)"
