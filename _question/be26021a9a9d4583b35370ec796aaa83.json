  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [SSRF Attack] Can an attacker provide a malicious URL in the UploadRequest that points to internal network resources (localhost, 169.254.169.254, private IP ranges), causing the Cloudflare API to fetch sensitive internal data or metadata from AWS/GCP instances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [SSRF Attack] Does the url parameter validation prevent file:// protocol URLs that could expose local filesystem contents when Cloudflare attempts to fetch the asset? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [SSRF Attack] Can an attacker use URL redirection chains to bypass any URL filtering, where an initially safe URL redirects to internal network resources during Cloudflare's fetch operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [SSRF Attack] Is there validation to prevent URLs with @ symbols that could be interpreted as authentication credentials (e.g., http://attacker.com@internal.host), potentially exposing internal services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_upload()] [Input Validation] Does the Json extractor validate the UploadRequest structure, or can malformed JSON payloads cause panics or unexpected behavior in the upload flow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [SSRF Attack] Can an attacker provide URLs with exotic protocols (gopher://, dict://, ftp://) that might be supported by underlying HTTP clients, enabling protocol smuggling attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [SSRF Attack] Can an attacker query for malicious URLs through the get_existing endpoint to probe internal network topology by observing timing differences or error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_upload()] [Missing Authentication] Are the POST / and GET /get_existing endpoints publicly accessible without any authentication, allowing arbitrary users to upload assets and consume Cloudflare API quota? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Credential Exposure] Is the cloudflare_auth_key properly secured, or can it leak through error messages, logs, or debug output if Cloudflare API calls fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Credential Exposure] Are the Authorization header and API key transmitted securely, or could they be exposed through request logging, debugging tools, or network monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: build_router()] [Missing Rate Limiting] Does the router implement rate limiting on upload endpoints, or can an attacker spam the service to exhaust Cloudflare API quota and incur excessive costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: AssetUploaderWorkerContext] [Configuration Exposure] Is the Arc<AssetUploaderWorkerConfig> properly protected, or can the cloudflare_auth_key be accessed through unsafe memory operations or debug output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_get_by_asset_uri()] [Missing Authorization] Can unauthenticated users query for existing assets to enumerate all uploaded NFT metadata, potentially exposing private or unreleased NFT collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Hash Collision] Does the SHA256 hashing of URLs provide sufficient collision resistance, or can an attacker craft two different URLs that produce the same hash, causing asset overwrites? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Hash Collision] Can URL normalization issues cause different representations of the same URL (with/without trailing slashes, query parameter order) to produce different SHA256 hashes, leading to duplicate uploads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [Hash Collision] If two different URLs hash to the same SHA256 digest, can an attacker retrieve the wrong asset by querying with a collision URL? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Predictable IDs] Are the SHA256-based IDs predictable, allowing attackers to pre-compute hashes and check for existence of specific NFT assets before they are publicly announced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [Infinite Loop] Does the pagination loop have an upper bound, or can it run infinitely if Cloudflare API continues returning exactly 10000 images per page, causing memory exhaustion and service crash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause the service to paginate through millions of Cloudflare images by querying for non-existent assets, consuming excessive API calls and memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does the parallel iteration with par_iter() consume unbounded memory when processing 10000 images per page, potentially causing OOM crashes on large Cloudflare accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: upload_asset()] [Large File Upload] Is there a size limit on uploaded assets, or can attackers upload extremely large files to exhaust Cloudflare storage quota and incur massive costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: get_by_asset_uri()] [Integer Overflow] Can the page counter overflow if pagination continues indefinitely, causing page to wrap to 0 or negative values and breaking the pagination logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/mod.rs] [Function: reqwest_response_to_axum_response()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does reading the entire response body into memory with bytes().await pose a DoS risk if Cloudflare returns extremely large responses? (Medium)",
