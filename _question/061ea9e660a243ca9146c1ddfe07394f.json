  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: ReceivedMessage] [Network ID Boundary] PeerNetworkId contains both PeerId and NetworkId. Can messages cross network boundaries inappropriately if network IDs are not validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: dial_peer()] [PeerId Validation] Is the PeerId validated to be a known validator before dialing, or can arbitrary peers be dialed causing resource waste or connection to malicious nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: Event::RpcRequest] [Response Timeout] If the application never responds through the oneshot::Sender, does the sender side timeout or can this leak channels indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: Event::RpcRequest] [Multiple Sends] Can the oneshot::Sender be cloned before wrapping in Arc, allowing multiple responses to be sent for a single RPC request, causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent RPC Limit] Is there a limit on concurrent outstanding RPCs per peer? Can unlimited concurrent RPCs cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Request-Response Matching] How are RPC responses matched to requests? Can response spoofing occur if matching is done by request ID that attackers can predict? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: NetworkEvents::new()] [Filter_map None Loss] Messages that fail deserialization return None and are filtered out. Can this cause critical messages to be silently dropped, creating validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: received_message_to_event()] [Selective Message Loss] Only RpcRequest and DirectSendMsg are converted to events. Can attackers exploit this by sending Error or RpcResponse messages that should be handled but are ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkSender] [Clone Safety] NetworkSender derives Clone. Can cloning create issues with shared PeerManagerRequestSender state or lead to message duplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkSender] [Send Bound] TMessage must be Send + 'static. Can this be violated through type erasure or unsafe code, causing thread safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkEvents] [Sync Bound] The event_stream is Send + Sync + 'static. Are there hidden non-Sync types that could violate this bound through type parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkEvents] [Pin Projection] The pin_project macro generates projections. Can incorrect pin projections cause memory unsafety if the Stream is manually unpinned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Self Project] Using self.project() to access fields. Can this violate pin guarantees if fields are accessed after projection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Module: Overall] [aptos_channel Assumptions] The code assumes aptos_channel behaves correctly. Can bugs in aptos_channel cause message loss or ordering violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Module: Overall] [Tokio Runtime] spawn_blocking depends on tokio runtime. Can runtime shutdowns or panics cause deserialization tasks to be aborted mid-operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/network/mod.rs] [Module: Overall] [Futures Compatibility] The code uses futures crate types. Can version mismatches between futures and tokio cause subtle async bugs? (Low)"
