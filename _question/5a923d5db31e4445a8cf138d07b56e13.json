  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Case Sensitivity] Are cloudflare_account_id and cloudflare_account_hash case-sensitive comparisons enforced, or can case variations bypass authentication checks in Cloudflare API integration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Integer Overflow] Although all fields are String types, if cloudflare_account_id is later parsed as a number, can extremely large values cause integer overflow in downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [TOCTOU Race] Between config deserialization and actual use in AssetUploaderWorkerContext, can a time-of-check-time-of-use race condition allow credential substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Null Byte Injection] Can null bytes (\\0) in cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix or cloudflare_default_variant truncate strings in C FFI boundaries if Cloudflare API uses native libraries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Config Poisoning] If config files are dynamically reloaded, can an attacker inject malicious AssetUploaderConfig values through file system race conditions during reload operations?
