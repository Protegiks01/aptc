  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Module visibility bypass] Can other Move modules access or manipulate ExtendRef/ManagingRefs through struct packing/unpacking operations that bypass the intended access control boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Friend function abuse] If friend functions are used with the object_code_deployment module, can malicious friend modules misuse ManagingRefs to perform unauthorized code operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Generic type exploitation] Can attackers exploit generic type parameters in functions that operate on ManagingRefs to bypass type safety and perform unauthorized operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Script function bypass] Can direct script functions that operate on ManagingRefs bypass the entry function restrictions and security checks implemented in the object_code_deployment module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ManagingRefs] [Storage cost manipulation] Can attackers create numerous ManagingRefs instances to inflate storage costs for code object owners, potentially forcing them to abandon objects or making deployments economically infeasible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Gas estimation attack] Can the size or structure of ManagingRefs be manipulated to cause gas estimation failures, preventing legitimate users from upgrading their code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Fee bypass] Can operations involving ManagingRefs be structured to avoid storage fees or execution fees while still achieving code deployment, creating unfair economic advantages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Feature flag bypass] Can ManagingRefs created before the OBJECT_CODE_DEPLOYMENT feature flag was disabled be used to continue deploying code after the feature is turned off, bypassing governance decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Permission check bypass] Can direct manipulation of ManagingRefs bypass the check_code_publishing_permission check, allowing unauthorized accounts to deploy or upgrade code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Frozen code revival] After code is frozen, can the ManagingRefs be used to somehow unfreeze or modify the code by exploiting edge cases in the freeze/upgrade logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Signer authority confusion] When extend_ref is used to generate a signer, is there proper verification that the generated signer has authority over the object, or can address confusion lead to unauthorized signer generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ExtendRef] [Address verification] Is the address field in ExtendRef cryptographically verified to match the object's actual address, or can forged addresses bypass security checks during signer generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Serialization format change] If the serialization format of ManagingRefs changes in a protocol upgrade, can existing ManagingRefs become corrupted or misinterpreted, leading to security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Backward compatibility] Are ManagingRefs structures from older versions of the protocol compatible with newer versions, or can version mismatches create exploitable inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ManagingRefs] [Field corruption] Can partial writes or storage corruption affect the extend_ref field in ManagingRefs, and if so, how does the system handle corrupted extend references during upgrade operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Time-of-check time-of-use] Can there be a TOCTOU vulnerability where ManagingRefs is validated at one point but modified before being used for signer generation, allowing unauthorized upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Object address prediction] Can attackers predict future object addresses by analyzing the domain separator and sequence number pattern, creating ManagingRefs in advance to frontrun legitimate deployments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Supply chain attack] Can a compromised dependency inject malicious code into the ManagingRefs deserialization path, enabling arbitrary code execution during structure loading? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ExtendRef] [Side channel leak] Can the serialization or comparison operations on ExtendRef leak information about addresses through timing side channels, enabling address enumeration or privacy violations? (Low)"
