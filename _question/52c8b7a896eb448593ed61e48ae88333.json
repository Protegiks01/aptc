  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Protocol confusion] Does combining direct_send and rpc protocol preferences in supported_protocol_ids cause peers that only support one protocol type to be incorrectly included in availability checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Consensus view inconsistency] Can different validators get different available peer lists at the same moment due to race conditions, causing them to send proposals/votes to different peer subsets and breaking consensus synchronization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Empty peer set] If get_connected_supported_peers returns an empty list during critical consensus operations, does this cause immediate liveness failure without proper fallback mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Message reordering] Can messages sent through different protocol preferences arrive out of order, causing consensus to process proposals before prerequisite messages like sync info, leading to round advancement failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Protocol downgrade attack] Can a malicious peer force the sender to use a specific protocol by advertising limited support, enabling protocol-specific vulnerabilities like deserialization bugs or amplification attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Silent message drop] If get_preferred_protocol_for_peer fails, does the error get properly propagated to the caller (e.g., consensus), or can messages be silently dropped causing mysterious consensus timeouts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Double-send vulnerability] Can race conditions cause the same message to be sent twice to the same peer through different code paths, and does the receiving peer properly deduplicate to prevent double-processing of consensus votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_raw()] [Malformed bytes] Since this accepts raw Bytes without validation, can an attacker inject malicious serialized data that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities in the peer's protocol handler? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_raw()] [Protocol bypass] Can send_to_peer_raw bypass message size limits or serialization checks that send_to_peer enforces, allowing oversized or malformed messages that crash peer nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_raw()] [Type confusion] If the raw bytes don't match the expected Message type for the selected protocol, can this cause deserialization errors that crash the receiving node or allow type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Partial delivery failure] If send_to_many fails for one network_id after successfully sending to others, does the function return error or success, potentially causing inconsistent message delivery across the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Message cloning overhead] Does cloning the message for each protocol group and network introduce vulnerabilities where message modification during cloning causes different peers to receive different message contents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Protocol group partition] Can peers grouped by different protocols receive messages at significantly different times, causing validators to process proposals in different orders and violating consensus ordering assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Iterator invalidation] Can the chunk_by iterator over peers be invalidated by concurrent peer disconnections during iteration, causing panics or skipped peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Empty peer handling] If the peers vector is empty or all peers fail protocol selection, does the function silently succeed without error, making the caller think broadcast succeeded when no messages were sent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Timeout manipulation] Can a malicious peer exploit the rpc_timeout parameter by sending partial responses that keep the RPC alive but never complete, causing resource exhaustion from hanging futures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Response spoofing] If multiple RPCs are in-flight to the same peer, can the peer send responses out of order to cause request-response mismatching, confusing application state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Protocol preference attack] Can a Byzantine peer advertise support for higher-preference RPC protocols but intentionally timeout requests, forcing senders to retry with lower preferences and degrade performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Async cancellation safety] If the RPC future is cancelled mid-flight (e.g., during node shutdown), are there dangling references or resource leaks in the network sender that could cause crashes on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Timeout bypass] Can extremely large rpc_timeout values cause RPCs to hang indefinitely, blocking consensus operations and causing liveness failures when waiting for Byzantine peer responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc_raw()] [Deserialization vulnerability] Since raw bytes are sent, can an attacker craft malicious byte sequences that exploit vulnerabilities in the peer's RPC response deserialization logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc_raw()] [Response type confusion] Can the returned Message be of an unexpected type due to protocol confusion, causing type casting panics in the caller application? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc_raw()] [Size validation bypass] Does send_rpc_raw skip message size validation that send_to_peer_rpc performs, allowing attackers to send oversized RPC requests that exhaust peer memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization inconsistency] Can different protocols serialize the same message into different byte representations, causing validators using different protocols to compute different message hashes and fail cryptographic verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Bytes cloning vulnerability] Does cloning Bytes for each peer create shared references that could lead to data races if the underlying buffer is modified concurrently? (High)"
