  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Missing event emission] If code creates a WithdrawFAEvent instance but fails to emit it (e.g., due to gas exhaustion), does the actual withdrawal still proceed, creating a balance tracking discrepancy that attackers can exploit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Partial event emission] In parallel execution scenarios, can race conditions cause some DepositFAEvent instances to be created but not emitted, resulting in deposits that occur without corresponding event records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [BCS serialization failure] If bcs::to_bytes() fails during create_event_v2() for WithdrawFAEvent (e.g., due to stack exhaustion with deeply nested data), does the withdrawal abort safely, or can funds be withdrawn without events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Event ordering guarantees] Are DepositFAEvent emissions guaranteed to be atomic with the actual deposit operation, or can events be emitted before/after state changes, creating windows for balance inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Balance underflow] If event processors track balances by summing deposits and subtracting withdrawals, can attackers emit WithdrawFAEvent with amounts exceeding actual deposits, causing negative balances or underflow in tracking systems? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Duplicate event processing] If the same DepositFAEvent is processed multiple times by indexers (e.g., during blockchain reorganizations), can this lead to inflated balance calculations enabling phantom fund tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Withdraw-without-deposit] Can an attacker emit WithdrawFAEvent for a store that has never received deposits, causing negative balance tracking in systems that don't validate initial state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Cross-asset confusion] Since events don't contain asset type information (only amount), can deposits of different fungible asset types to the same store be incorrectly aggregated, causing balance tracking errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Event-state desync] If the actual on-chain FungibleStore balance diverges from the balance calculated from WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent history (e.g., due to direct state manipulation), how is this detected and reconciled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Concurrent event emission] In parallel transaction execution, can two transactions simultaneously emit WithdrawFAEvent for the same store with amounts that individually are valid but combined exceed the store balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Race condition in event processing] Can race conditions between event emission and event processing cause DepositFAEvent to be indexed before the actual deposit is committed, creating temporary phantom balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use gap between validating withdrawal availability and emitting WithdrawFAEvent, allowing attackers to double-spend by racing multiple withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Parallel execution anomalies] In Block-STM parallel execution, can speculative execution emit DepositFAEvent instances that are later aborted, but the events remain visible to indexers causing ghost balance increases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Event buffer overflow] If many WithdrawFAEvent instances are emitted in a single transaction, can event buffer limits be exceeded, causing some events to be silently dropped and creating balance tracking gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Gas exhaustion] Can an attacker intentionally cause gas exhaustion after creating but before emitting a WithdrawFAEvent, resulting in completed withdrawals without corresponding event records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Event spam] Can an attacker emit massive numbers of DepositFAEvent instances with tiny amounts to overwhelm event indexers, causing service degradation or incorrect balance calculations due to processing timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Serialization cost] Is there proper gas accounting for the bcs::to_bytes() operation in create_event_v2(), or can attackers create events with pathological serialization costs causing validator slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker craft withdrawal patterns that cause unbounded memory growth in systems tracking WithdrawFAEvent history, leading to out-of-memory conditions in indexers or validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Cross-module event injection] Can a malicious module call the fungible_asset module's internal functions to emit WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent without actually transferring assets, creating fake balance change records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Privilege escalation] Can an attacker exploit event emission from one fungible asset type to affect the balance tracking of a different asset type, causing cross-asset balance corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Module upgrade attack] If the fungible_asset module is upgraded via governance, can old WithdrawFAEvent formats become incompatible with new event processing logic, causing historical balance calculations to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event type substitution] Can an attacker deploy a module that re-exports WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent and emit events that appear legitimate but bypass validation checks in the original fungible_asset module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Indexer poisoning] Can an attacker craft WithdrawFAEvent data that exploits parsing vulnerabilities in event indexers (e.g., SQL injection in store address, overflow in amount field), compromising off-chain infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [API query manipulation] If indexers filter DepositFAEvent by store address, can attackers use address encoding tricks (e.g., leading zeros, case variations) to hide events from queries while still affecting on-chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Deserialization inconsistency] Can differences in BCS deserialization implementations between validators and indexers cause WithdrawFAEvent to be interpreted differently, leading to balance tracking discrepancies? (High)"
