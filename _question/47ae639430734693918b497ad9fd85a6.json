  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [InQuorumStore Processing] Does process_qs_payload() validate that all proofs in proof_with_data are valid and from authorized signers before fetching transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Transaction Limit Confusion] Different payload types return different transaction limits (max_txns_to_execute) - can validators with different payload interpretations execute different transaction counts, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Gas Limit Override] For QuorumStoreInlineHybridV2, execution_limits can override gas limits - can malicious proposers set gas limits to None to bypass gas metering? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [OptQuorumStore Order] Transactions are concatenated as [proof_batch_txns, opt_batch_txns, inline_batch_txns] - is this ordering guaranteed to be deterministic across all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Consensus Publisher Race] If consensus_publisher.publish_message() fails or is slow, can this delay block execution and affect consensus liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Block Info Construction] Does gen_block_info(HashValue::zero(), 0, None) with zero values cause validation issues in consensus observer nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Clone Overhead] Is transaction_payload.clone() for consensus publishing causing significant memory overhead for large blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_inline_transactions()] [Transaction Cloning] Transactions are cloned with txns.clone() - can this be exploited with extremely large transaction payloads to cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_inline_transactions()] [Payload Type Coverage] Does get_inline_transactions() correctly handle all payload types, or can new payload variants be added that bypass inline transaction extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_inline_transactions()] [Empty Vector Confusion] For non-inline payload types, empty vec![] is returned - can this be confused with genuinely empty inline batches, causing validation logic to be skipped? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_inline_transactions()] [Flat_map Ordering] Does flat_map preserve the ordering of transactions within and between batches, or can transaction ordering vary between validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Signer Construction] Signers are collected from additional_peers_to_request BitVec and block author - can incorrect BitVec indices cause requests to non-validator peers or missing requests to valid peers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Index Out of Bounds] If BitVec.iter_ones() returns indices >= ordered_authors.len(), can ordered_authors.get(i) return None, causing signers to be silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Author Duplication] If block.author() is already in additional_peers_to_request BitVec, can the author be added twice to signers, causing duplicate network requests? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Signer Ordering] Does the order of signers (BitVec peers first, then block author, then summary signers) affect batch retrieval success or create non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Batch Summary Iteration] Can malicious batch_summary entries cause the map() operation to produce invalid BatchInfo objects that fail validation later? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Timestamp Reuse] Using block.timestamp_usecs() for all batch requests - can this cause issues if batches have different expiration times or require different timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_qs_payload()] [Deprecated Warning] The function is marked deprecated - can inconsistencies between this and newer payload processing cause state divergence if some validators use old code? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_qs_payload()] [Shuffled Signers] Does shuffled_signers() produce deterministic results across all validators, or can different shuffling lead to different batch retrieval order and potential timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_qs_payload()] [Proof Validation] Are proofs in proof_with_data validated for signatures and quorum requirements before calling shuffled_signers(), or can invalid proofs be processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_qs_payload()] [Migration Risk] As code migrates from process_qs_payload() to OptQuorumStore processing, can mixed usage cause validators to process different transaction sets? (Critical)",
