  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [Protobuf varint overflow] Can malicious varint-encoded fields in protobuf messages overflow during decoding, causing integer wraparound vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [Default value confusion] Do optional fields with default values create ambiguity between 'not set' and 'set to default', allowing security checks to be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [Message size limits] Are there global message size limits enforced during protobuf deserialization, or can arbitrarily large messages cause OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [Repeated field limits] Are repeated field counts bounded to prevent memory exhaustion from messages with millions of repeated elements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [String length limits] Are string field lengths bounded, or can multi-megabyte strings in address/module/function fields cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.indexer.v1.rs] [General] [Oneof exhaustiveness] Does pattern matching on oneof enums handle all variants exhaustively, or can new variants added in protobuf updates cause panics? (Medium)",
