  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune() via TransactionAccumulatorDb::prune()] [Odd version assumption] The code comment states 'The even version will be pruned in the iteration of version + 1' - can the loop terminating at an even end version violate this assumption and leave even versions unpruned?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Batch explosion] Can carefully chosen version ranges cause the pruning algorithm to generate exponentially many delete operations per version, exhausting memory in the SchemaBatch?
