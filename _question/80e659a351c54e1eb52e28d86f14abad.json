(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: new()] [Refund carry-over] When creating a new EpilogueSession, could storage_refund from a previous session inadvertently carry over, giving undeserved refunds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Struct: EpilogueSession] [Refund immutability] Is storage_refund immutable after session creation, or could it be modified through interior mutability or unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: finish()] [Status downgrade] Could execution_status be downgraded from failure to success between epilogue execution and VMOutput creation, hiding transaction failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: finish()] [Keep vs Discard manipulation] Since finish() always wraps execution_status in TransactionStatus::Keep, could this force keeping of transactions that should be discarded?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: finish()] [Fee statement bypass] Could the fee_statement parameter be a zero-valued FeeStatement allowing free transaction execution despite actual resource consumption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: finish()] [Gas component manipulation] Could individual components of FeeStatement (execution_gas, io_gas, storage_fee) be manipulated to pay less than actual consumption? (High)",

(Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/epilogue.rs] [Function: finish()] [Empty change set handling] Does finish() handle empty change sets correctly, or could transactions with no state changes bypass important epilogue checks? (Medium)",
