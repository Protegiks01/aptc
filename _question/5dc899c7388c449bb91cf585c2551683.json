  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Error Message Disclosure] When the function returns errors (line 23), do error messages contain sensitive information about internal network topology, paths, or configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Context Propagation] The function uses .context() for error wrapping - can error chains leak sensitive information about internal state or processing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Async Cancellation] Since this is an async function, can cancellation (e.g., tokio task abort) leave the reqwest client in an inconsistent state or leak resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [DNS Cache Poisoning] Does the reqwest client cache DNS results, and if so, can an attacker poison the cache to redirect subsequent requests to malicious servers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [HTTP/2 Vulnerabilities] Does reqwest use HTTP/2 by default, and are there protocol-level vulnerabilities (e.g., rapid reset, stream multiplexing attacks) that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Proxy Configuration] If the environment has proxy settings (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY), can an attacker manipulate these to route requests through malicious proxies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Content-Length Mismatch] Can a server return a CONTENT_LENGTH header that doesn't match the actual body size in a subsequent GET request, causing downstream issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Chunked Encoding] Does the function properly handle Transfer-Encoding: chunked responses that don't have CONTENT_LENGTH headers, or will it return size=0 incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [HEAD Request Limitations] Some servers respond differently to HEAD vs GET - can this cause metadata extraction to succeed but actual download to fail with different content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [IP Address Resolution] For domains with multiple A/AAAA records, does reqwest try all IPs, and can an attacker register a domain with one safe IP and multiple malicious IPs to bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Rate Limiting Bypass] Can an attacker use URL variations (query params, fragments, case differences) to bypass rate limiting while still hitting the same endpoint? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide many unique URLs that each take MAX_HEAD_REQUEST_RETRY_SECONDS to timeout, exhausting worker threads or async runtime resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [URL Fragment Handling] Does the function strip URL fragments (#) before making requests, or can fragments be used to create unique cache keys while hitting the same resource? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Punycode/IDN Homograph] Can an attacker use internationalized domain names (IDN) with Punycode to create visually similar domains that bypass allowlists (e.g., 'аpple.com' with Cyrillic 'а')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Client Memory Leak] Does creating a new Client for each request leak memory over time, especially if requests are cancelled before completion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Status Code Handling] The function doesn't check HTTP status codes - can an attacker return 4xx/5xx errors with crafted CONTENT_TYPE/CONTENT_LENGTH headers to manipulate metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Compression Headers] Does the function handle Content-Encoding headers (gzip, deflate, br), and can compressed content size differ from CONTENT_LENGTH causing validation bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Modules: asset_uploader, config, models, parser, schema, utils] [Module Security] Are there security vulnerabilities in how the exported modules interact with get_uri_metadata(), such as improper input sanitization before calling this function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [HTTP Request Smuggling] Can carefully crafted URLs with spaces, tabs, or newlines cause HTTP request smuggling when combined with certain proxy configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Trailing Dot Bypass] Can an attacker use trailing dots in domain names (e.g., 'evil.com.' vs 'evil.com') to bypass DNS-based filtering while still resolving to the same IP? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_uri_metadata()] [Open Redirect Chain] Can an attacker chain multiple redirects through different domains to eventually reach an internal resource, bypassing single-hop redirect checks? (Medium)"
