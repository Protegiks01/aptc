  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() compilation] [Address manipulation] Can the compiler generate bytecode with manipulated addresses that bypass access control checks or allow impersonation of system accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() compilation] [Nonce bypass] Can compiled scripts bypass sequence number (nonce) checks, enabling transaction replay attacks or out-of-order execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() output] [VM incompatibility] Can the compiler generate bytecode that's incompatible with the Move VM version used by validators, causing runtime failures or undefined behavior during transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() output] [Instruction encoding] Can malformed instruction encoding in compiled bytecode cause the Move VM to enter undefined states or bypass safety checks during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() output] [Gas calculation inconsistency] Can discrepancies between compile-time gas estimates and runtime gas consumption cause transactions to fail unexpectedly or enable gas manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() output] [Module compatibility] Does the compiler enforce compatibility rules for module updates? Can incompatible updates be compiled that break existing code depending on the module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: verify_tool test] [Test bypass] Does the verify_tool test at line 179 adequately test security-critical paths, or can vulnerabilities exist that aren't covered by clap's debug_assert()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Development vs production] Is this compiler tool properly isolated from production validator nodes, or can attackers exploit it as an attack vector against running validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Case sensitivity] Can case-insensitive filesystems cause security issues where malicious.mvir and Malicious.mvir are treated as the same file in some contexts but different in others? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Special filenames] Does the compiler properly handle special filenames like CON, PRN, NUL on Windows that could cause unexpected behavior or DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path length limits] Can extremely long paths on Windows (>260 characters) cause compilation failures or bypass path validation checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Temporary file security] Does the compiler create any temporary files during compilation? Are they created securely to prevent race conditions or information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Empty file handling] Can an empty source file or dependency file cause panics or undefined behavior during parsing or deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Zero-byte output] Can compilation produce zero-byte output files that could cause issues when loaded by validators or other tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode handling] Are all string operations (paths, identifiers, error messages) properly handling Unicode, or can invalid UTF-8 sequences cause panics or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Module name collision] Can two different source files compile to modules with identical fully-qualified names, causing namespace conflicts or module substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Repeated compilation] If the same source is compiled multiple times in rapid succession, can race conditions in file I/O or caching cause inconsistent results? (Medium)"
