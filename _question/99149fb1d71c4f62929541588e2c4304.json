  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/prefix.rs] [Error handling: Panic safety] [Unwrap/expect absence] While the code doesn't use unwrap(), could panics in called functions (encode(), state_key.encoded()) cause validator crashes during prefix matching? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/prefix.rs] [Error handling: Error propagation] [Silent failures] If encode() or is_prefix() returns Err, are calling contexts properly handling these errors, or could silent failures lead to incomplete query results appearing valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/prefix.rs] [Error handling: Partial results] [Iterator early termination] If is_prefix() fails mid-iteration through state keys, does the iterator properly terminate or can it return partial results that violate atomicity guarantees? (Medium)"
