  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Constants: LRU_CACHE_HIT, LRU_CACHE_PROBE] [Value validation] Are these string constants properly validated when used as labels, or can typos or modifications cause metrics to be recorded under wrong labels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Constants: RESULT_SUCCESS, RESULT_FAILURE] [Enumeration completeness] Are all possible result states covered by these constants, or can unexpected results be recorded under arbitrary strings causing metric fragmentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Constants: SUBSCRIPTION_* events] [Event coverage] Do the subscription event constants cover all possible subscription states, or can unknown events be recorded causing monitoring blind spots? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Constants: TRUNCATION_* reasons] [Truncation completeness] Are all truncation scenarios covered, or can new truncation reasons be added without updating these constants causing fragmented metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [All Metrics] [Prometheus scraping] Can an attacker exploit the Prometheus scraping endpoint to cause excessive metric serialization CPU usage when cardinality is very high, degrading validator performance during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [All Metrics] [Metric retention] Are old metric labels properly cleaned up, or can historical network_id values accumulate forever causing unbounded memory growth over time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [All Metrics] [Alert correlation] If metrics become corrupted or inaccurate due to race conditions, can this prevent proper alerting on actual attacks or system failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [All Metrics] [Monitoring blindness] If metric collection fails silently, can attackers operate undetected by exploiting the lack of visibility into storage service operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [All Latency Histograms] [Percentile accuracy] Can high-cardinality labels cause histogram memory pressure that degrades percentile calculation accuracy, hiding performance degradation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: STORAGE_REQUESTS_RECEIVED] [Attack detection bypass] Can an attacker send malicious storage requests with crafted request_type values that don't increment this counter, avoiding detection while exploiting storage vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: STORAGE_ERRORS_ENCOUNTERED] [Error masking] Can attackers cause metrics registration to fail so that storage errors are not tracked, allowing them to exploit vulnerabilities without triggering alerts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: OPTIMISTIC_FETCH_COUNT] [Resource tracking bypass] Can malicious actors create optimistic fetches that aren't properly tracked by this gauge, enabling unbounded resource consumption without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: SUBSCRIPTION_COUNT] [Subscription flooding] If subscription count tracking fails, can attackers create unlimited subscriptions to exhaust validator resources without triggering monitoring alerts? (Critical)",
