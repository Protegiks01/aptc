  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Recovery confusion] Can an attacker emit fake KeyRotation events that cause wallet recovery tools to derive incorrect account addresses, leading to fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Historical replay] Can historical KeyRotation events be replayed or reordered during wallet recovery to confuse the key derivation chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Partial recovery] If some KeyRotation events are missing or corrupted, can wallet recovery still work correctly, or will it derive wrong addresses? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Feature flag exploitation] Can the module_event_migration_enabled() feature flag be manipulated to cause inconsistent event emission between validators? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Version confusion] Can clients or indexers get confused between KeyRotationEvent (legacy) and KeyRotation (v2), processing the same rotation twice? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Backward compatibility] Are there any breaking changes in KeyRotation compared to KeyRotationEvent that could cause issues with existing tooling? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Timestamp/ordering] Does KeyRotation include timestamp information, and if not, can events be reordered in ways that break causal ordering? (Medium)",
