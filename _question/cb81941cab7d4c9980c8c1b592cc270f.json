  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_size] [Null pointer] Can passing None to resource_size() cause any unexpected behavior in size calculations used for gas metering? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Stack overflow] Can deeply nested resource loading (resources referencing other resources) cause stack overflow in recursive implementation patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_bytes_with_metadata_and_layout] [Heap fragmentation] Can repeated calls with varying resource sizes cause heap fragmentation that degrades validator performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Gas metering bypass] Can implementations return resources with incorrect sizes that bypass gas metering checks, allowing transactions to consume more resources than paid for? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Deserialization failure] When the returned Bytes fail to deserialize in the VM, does the trait guarantee proper error propagation, or can deserialization errors be silently ignored leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Type safety violation] Can implementations return data that deserializes successfully but violates Move's type invariants (e.g., resource duplication), breaking Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Transaction isolation] Can implementations violate transaction isolation by allowing one transaction to see uncommitted changes from another concurrent transaction? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Non-deterministic reads] Can implementations use non-deterministic sources (timestamps, random numbers, etc.) when resolving resources, causing validators to produce different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Version skew] Can implementations return resources from different storage versions or snapshots inconsistently, causing state divergence across validators? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: ResourceResolver] [Write-read consistency] After a resource is written in a transaction, can subsequent reads return stale data instead of the updated value, violating write-read consistency? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_bytes_with_metadata_and_layout] [Framework resource protection] Can implementations properly distinguish between user resources and Aptos framework system resources, preventing unauthorized modifications to critical system state?
