  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Gas bypass] Can an attacker pass maliciously crafted NativeGasParameters with zero or extremely low gas costs to bypass gas metering during execution, enabling DoS attacks through infinite loops in native functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Economic exploit] Can manipulated MiscGasParameters be provided to alter storage gas costs, allowing attackers to write unlimited data to state storage without proper economic constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Gas inconsistency] If native_gas_parameters contain inconsistent or contradictory gas costs between related operations, can this lead to deterministic execution failures across validators causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Integer overflow] Can extremely large gas parameter values cause integer overflow when multiplied during gas calculations in the returned NativeFunctionTable, leading to negative or zero gas charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Privileged operation exposure] Since this function returns natives built with the 'testing' feature including debug functions, can attackers access create_signers_for_testing to forge arbitrary account signatures in production if this function is mistakenly used outside testing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Cryptographic bypass] Does the testing feature enable generate_keys_internal and sign_internal natives that could be exploited to generate predictable cryptographic keys or forge signatures, breaking the security of the entire blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Event manipulation] Can the emitted_events_internal debug native be exploited to read or manipulate event emissions in ways that violate event ordering guarantees or leak sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Test-production confusion] If this function is accidentally called in production validator code instead of the production aptos_natives function, what is the security impact of having debug natives available to all transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Feature flag bypass] By using TimedFeaturesBuilder::enable_all().build(), does this unconditionally enable all timed features regardless of activation timestamps, potentially exposing unaudited or unfinished features that could contain vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Consensus divergence] If enable_all() enables features with different behavior than production networks, can this cause test transactions to execute differently than production, leading to incorrect test results that miss critical bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Protocol violation] Can TimedFeaturesBuilder::enable_all() enable incompatible feature combinations that violate protocol invariants, such as enabling features that should be mutually exclusive? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Determinism break] If timed features affect gas costs or execution paths, does enable_all() create non-deterministic behavior across different test runs depending on which features are enabled in each version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Version skew] Since LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION is hardcoded, can mismatches between the test gas version and production gas versions cause tests to miss gas-related DoS vulnerabilities that only appear in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Gas schedule bypass] If LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION enables gas features not yet activated on production networks, can this mask gas vulnerabilities in code that will later be deployed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Backward compatibility] If the gas feature version changes between test and production, can this cause transactions that passed testing to fail in production due to different gas calculation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Feature configuration] Does Features::default() match production feature flags, or does it use different defaults that could hide bugs in feature-gated code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Security feature bypass] If Features::default() disables important security features that are enabled in production (like signature verification or access controls), can this lead to vulnerable code passing tests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Feature flag injection] Can an attacker who controls the test environment manipulate Features::default() to enable dangerous feature combinations that expose vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Global state modification] Since natives::configure_for_unit_test() is called as a side effect, can race conditions occur if multiple threads simultaneously call aptos_debug_natives(), corrupting the global unit test configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Extension hook override] If configure_for_unit_test() sets a global extension hook via set_extension_hook, can malicious code override this hook to inject malicious native contexts into test execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [State pollution] Are the side effects of natives::configure_for_unit_test() properly cleaned up, or do they persist across test runs potentially causing non-deterministic test failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Initialization order] If aptos_debug_natives() is called before proper initialization of other system components, can this lead to partially initialized state that causes crashes or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Validation bypass] Can the validation hook set by set_validation_hook be overridden by malicious code to disable extended_checks, allowing buggy Move code to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Race condition] If multiple threads call configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test() concurrently, can this cause race conditions in set_validation_hook leading to undefined hook state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Validation skip] If extended_checks::run_extended_checks panics or errors, are these errors properly propagated, or can buggy code silently pass validation? (High)"
