  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Zero duration edge case] Does passing Duration::ZERO cause state sync to return immediately without any actual syncing, allowing consensus to make decisions on stale state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: respond_to_sync_duration_notification()] [None ledger info semantics] What does None for latest_synced_ledger_info mean - no sync occurred, or sync failed, and can this ambiguity be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Single transaction performance] Does sending many single-transaction notifications vs one multi-transaction notification cause different behavior or performance, creating attack vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationResponse] [Default values] Can ConsensusNotificationResponse be constructed with invalid default values (Ok with None ledger info for sync operations)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Transaction vector reuse] Can the same Vec<Transaction> be shared across multiple notifications, causing one notification's modifications to affect others? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Callback channel exhaustion] Can creating thousands of oneshot channels for callbacks cause file descriptor exhaustion or kernel resource limits to be hit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Ledger info reference lifetime] Is the LedgerInfoWithSignatures target consumed or cloned, and can this lead to use-after-move errors if accessed later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Mutable access prevention] Does returning immutable reference prevent modification, or can unsafe code or interior mutability allow transaction tampering after notification is sent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Async task spawning] If consensus spawns this as async task without awaiting, can tasks queue up unboundedly causing task scheduler exhaustion? (High)",
