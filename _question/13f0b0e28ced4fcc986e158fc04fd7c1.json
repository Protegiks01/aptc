  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Non-Deterministic Ordering] If HashMap iteration order in delayed_queue (used for accounts and use_cases) is non-deterministic, can this cause different validators to produce different transaction orderings from the same input, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Timing Dependency] If the logic at line 47 where bump_output_idx is called depends on wall-clock time or non-deterministic factors, can validators disagree on when delayed transactions become ready? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Floating Point Arithmetic] If Config spread factors involve any floating-point calculations (cast to/from f64), can rounding differences across CPU architectures cause validators to compute different try_delay_till values? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: new()] [Config Serialization] If Config is deserialized differently across validators (e.g., due to endianness or version differences), will this cause transaction ordering divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Parse Function Determinism] Are parse_sender() and parse_use_case() guaranteed deterministic, or can differences in Transaction parsing logic cause validators to categorize transactions differently? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Unwrap Panics] If delayed_queue.pop_head() or delayed_queue.queue_or_return() panic due to internal assertion failures, does this crash the validator node, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [VecDeque Empty Panic] If input_queue.pop_front() is called when empty due to logic errors, can this cause panics? (Low - the loop condition should prevent this)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn()] [Partial Update Panic] If select_next_txn_inner() returns Some(txn) but panics before line 41 can increment output_idx, is the transaction lost and output_idx left incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [DelayedQueue Invariant Panic] If delayed_queue has internal invariant violations (e.g., expect() calls failing), can this cascade to panics in select_next_txn_inner() halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Extension Panic] If the IntoIterator passed to extended_with() panics during iteration, is the ShuffledTransactionIterator left in a corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [FIFO Violation] The three-stage selection logic (delayed ready, input queue scan, delayed not ready) may violate FIFO ordering - can later transactions bypass earlier ones, enabling front-running or MEV attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Starvation Attack] Can an attacker continuously submit transactions that populate delayed_queue such that transactions in input_queue never get selected (starved), violating liveness for specific accounts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Priority Manipulation] By controlling the timing and use_case of their transactions, can an attacker manipulate the order in which transactions are returned relative to a target victim transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Batch Bias] If extended_with() is called multiple times with different transaction batches, does the order in which batches are added affect final transaction ordering in ways that attackers can exploit? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Use Case Favoritism] Can the use_case_spread_factor be configured such that Platform transactions always get prioritized over ContractAddress transactions, creating unfair advantages? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Duplicate Transactions] Does extended_with() check for duplicate transactions, or can the same transaction be added multiple times leading to double-execution and state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Transaction Validation] Are transactions validated before being added to input_queue, or can malformed transactions cause parse_sender()/parse_use_case() to panic during select_next_txn_inner()? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: new()] [Config Bounds] Does new() check that Config values are within reasonable bounds, or can u64::MAX spread factors cause arithmetic overflow in delay calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Invalid Input Idx] If input_idx is corrupted (e.g., decremented somehow), can this cause delayed_queue to violate its ordering invariants based on DelayKey comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Output Idx Bounds] Is there any check that output_idx remains less than or equal to input_idx, or can bugs cause output_idx > input_idx leading to underflow in delayed_queue calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Validator Divergence] If two validators start with the same transaction list but one has different delayed_queue state from processing previous blocks, will they produce identical orderings, or can this cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: new()] [State Initialization] When creating a new iterator for each block, is delayed_queue state properly reset, or can state leak from previous blocks affect current block ordering inconsistently across validators?
