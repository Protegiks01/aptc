  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Observability] [Performance tracking] Without metrics on send latency and success rates per peer, can performance degradation or Byzantine behavior go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Security] [Authentication bypass] Does the interface assume that NetworkSender performs authentication, or can unauthenticated messages be injected through raw send functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Security] [Authorization checks] Are there authorization checks to ensure applications can only send messages appropriate for their role (e.g., consensus can't send mempool messages)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Security] [Rate limiting] Is there any rate limiting on send operations to prevent a compromised application from flooding the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Security] [Message size limits] Are message sizes validated before sending to prevent amplification attacks where small requests generate large responses? (High)"
