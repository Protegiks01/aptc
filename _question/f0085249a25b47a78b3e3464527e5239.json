  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Overall] [Optimization safety] If pure functions are optimized differently (e.g., memoization, reordering), can incorrect purity classification lead to optimization bugs where side effects occur in unexpected order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Overall] [Gas metering] If gas calculations assume pure functions have no side effects, can incorrect purity classification lead to wrong gas estimates and potential DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Overall] [Parallel execution] If Aptos parallel execution relies on purity information to determine transaction independence, can incorrect purity classification lead to race conditions or non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Overall] [State commitment] If pure functions are assumed to not affect state commitment, can incorrect purity classification lead to state tree inconsistencies across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Multi-stage attack] Can an attacker first deploy a function F that appears pure during initial checking, then later deploy function G that calls F, where the combination triggers impurity that wasn't detected in isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Timing-based attack] Can an attacker exploit the order of function checking to ensure impure functions are checked before their callers, causing the optimistic 'true' insertion at line 163 to persist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Cache poisoning chain] Can an attacker craft a series of function definitions that poison the pureness cache in a specific order, causing downstream functions to be incorrectly classified? (High)"
