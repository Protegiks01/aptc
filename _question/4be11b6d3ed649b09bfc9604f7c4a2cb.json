  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS bomb] Can an attacker provide malicious BCS bytes that deserialize to a NewBlockEvent with previous_block_votes_bitvec or failed_proposer_indices containing billions of elements, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS malformation] If BCS bytes are truncated or contain invalid length prefixes, does bcs::from_bytes() fail safely without panicking or causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization DoS] Can a Byzantine validator broadcast NewBlockEvent BCS bytes that take exponential time to deserialize (e.g., deeply nested structures), causing consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can BCS bytes deserialize to a structurally-valid NewBlockEvent but with semantically invalid data (e.g., epoch=0, round=MAX) that bypasses downstream validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Arbitrary field values] Does try_from_bytes() perform ANY validation on deserialized fields, or can all fields have arbitrary values including contradictory consensus metadata? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] If deserialization fails, does the Result propagate properly through consensus/storage layers, or can errors be silently ignored causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Version compatibility] If the Move struct NewBlockEvent adds/removes fields in future upgrades, will try_from_bytes() fail gracefully or cause deserialization errors breaking backward compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Side channel] Can timing differences in bcs::from_bytes() execution leak information about NewBlockEvent field values to attackers monitoring validator nodes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] If MODULE_NAME='block' doesn't match actual Move module name, can this cause deserialization failures or wrong event routing in storage? (High)",
