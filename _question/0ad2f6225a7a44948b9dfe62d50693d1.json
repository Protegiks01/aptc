  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that bypass validation in bcs::from_bytes() to create TokenWithdraw events with arbitrary account addresses, potentially allowing unauthorized withdrawal event emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion] Does try_from_bytes() have length limits on the input bytes slice, or can an attacker provide extremely large byte arrays causing memory exhaustion and validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic safety] Can malformed BCS bytes trigger panics in the deserialization process that are not caught by the Result wrapper, causing validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide BCS bytes that deserialize into a valid TokenWithdraw but with type-confused TokenId fields, allowing withdrawal events for non-existent or wrong tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] During BCS deserialization of the amount field (u64), can specially crafted bytes cause integer overflow that wraps around to small values, allowing large withdrawals to be recorded as tiny amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation bypass] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on the account parameter, or can arbitrary AccountAddress values (including system addresses like 0x0 or 0x1) be used to create fake withdrawal events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [TokenId validation] Is the TokenId parameter validated in new() to ensure it references an existing token, or can attackers create withdrawal events for non-existent tokens causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Amount validation] Does new() validate that amount is non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can zero-amount or MAX_U64 withdrawals be created causing integer overflow in downstream balance calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Field visibility] Are the account, id, and amount fields private enough to prevent external modification after construction, or can they be mutated through unsafe code or trait implementations leading to event tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: amount()] [Integer overflow] When amount() returns u64 values that are then used in arithmetic operations, can the lack of overflow checking cause balance calculations to wrap around, enabling unlimited token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Zero amount] Can TokenWithdraw events with amount = 0 be emitted and processed, potentially bypassing withdrawal fee calculations or causing division-by-zero errors in fee computation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [MAX_U64 amount] If amount is set to u64::MAX, can downstream operations that add to this value cause overflow panics or silent wrapping, allowing attackers to drain token supplies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: amount()] [Type coercion] When amount() returns u64, are there implicit conversions to smaller integer types (u32, u16) in calling code that could truncate large withdrawal amounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: account()] [System address bypass] Can the account field be set to system-reserved addresses (0x0, 0x1, 0x3, etc.), potentially allowing withdrawal events that bypass normal token ownership checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: account()] [Invalid address] Does AccountAddress validation occur during TokenWithdraw construction, or can malformed/invalid addresses cause validator crashes when processing withdrawal events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [Address collision] If two different TokenWithdraw events reference the same account but different tokens, can event ordering issues cause one withdrawal to be applied twice or skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: id()] [Non-existent token] Can TokenWithdraw events be created with TokenId values that don't correspond to any existing token in the system, causing state corruption or panics during event processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: id()] [Token ownership bypass] Does the TokenId reference include ownership verification, or can withdrawal events be emitted for tokens not owned by the specified account? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: id] [TokenDataId validation] Since TokenId contains TokenDataId with creator, collection, and name fields, can malicious values in these nested fields bypass validation and reference unauthorized tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: id] [Property version manipulation] Can the property_version field in TokenId be manipulated to reference a non-existent token version, causing withdrawal from wrong token states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Replay attack] Are TokenWithdraw events protected against replay attacks, or can an attacker re-emit old withdrawal events to duplicate token withdrawals and steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Event sequencing] If multiple TokenWithdraw events for the same account and token are emitted in a single transaction, is the ordering guaranteed, or can race conditions cause incorrect final balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Cross-transaction ordering] Can TokenWithdraw events from different transactions be reordered during parallel execution, causing non-deterministic withdrawal processing and state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Event duplication] Can the same TokenWithdraw event be emitted multiple times (either accidentally or maliciously), causing double-withdrawal and fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] Can MODULE_NAME or STRUCT_NAME constants be spoofed or manipulated to make TokenWithdraw events appear as different event types, bypassing validation? (High)"
