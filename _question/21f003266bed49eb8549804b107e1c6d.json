  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.amount] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft a WithdrawFAEvent with amount field set to u64::MAX, causing integer overflow when aggregating multiple withdrawal events for balance tracking, potentially leading to incorrect balance calculations and fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent.amount] [Integer overflow] If multiple DepositFAEvent instances with large amount values (near u64::MAX) are processed sequentially, can the cumulative addition overflow u64 limits, causing balance inconsistencies and allowing attackers to bypass maximum balance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.amount] [Underflow attack] Can an attacker emit a WithdrawFAEvent with amount=0 repeatedly to trigger edge cases in balance tracking systems that assume non-zero withdrawals, potentially causing denial of service or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent.amount] [Arithmetic manipulation] If event processors subtract withdrawal amounts from deposit amounts for net balance calculation, can an attacker craft events where withdrawal > deposit causing underflow, resulting in incorrect positive balances and potential fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: Serialize/Deserialize] [BCS injection] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that deserialize into valid WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent structures but contain poisoned data (e.g., modified amount or store fields), bypassing validation during event emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Deserialization bomb] Can an attacker create a malformed BCS payload that causes excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption during deserialization of WithdrawFAEvent, leading to validator slowdown or denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Type confusion] Since WithdrawFAEvent and DepositFAEvent have identical field layouts (store, amount), can an attacker deserialize a WithdrawFAEvent as DepositFAEvent (or vice versa), causing incorrect balance updates where withdrawals are counted as deposits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [BCS canonicalization] Does the Serde Serialize implementation guarantee canonical BCS encoding for these events, or can attackers create multiple distinct byte representations for the same logical event, breaking event deduplication and causing double-counting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Malformed data handling] If a DepositFAEvent is deserialized with extra trailing bytes or missing fields, does the deserializer fail safely, or can partial deserialization lead to corrupted event data being processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.store] [Address spoofing] Can an attacker emit a WithdrawFAEvent with a store address that doesn't match the actual FungibleStore being withdrawn from, allowing them to attribute withdrawals to arbitrary accounts and potentially frame innocent users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent.store] [Invalid address] Is there validation that the store field in DepositFAEvent points to a valid FungibleStore object address, or can attackers create events with non-existent/invalid addresses causing indexers to track phantom balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.store] [Address collision] If two FungibleStores somehow have the same AccountAddress (e.g., due to address collision or object reuse), can events targeting one store be incorrectly applied to the other, leading to balance corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent.store] [System address abuse] Can an attacker emit DepositFAEvent events with store addresses pointing to system accounts (0x1, 0x2, etc.), potentially causing indexers to incorrectly track system account balances or trigger privileged operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.store] [Zero address] Is there any protection against events with store=0x0 (zero address), and if not, can this cause null pointer-like bugs in event processing systems that assume valid addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Event replay] Do WithdrawFAEvent instances contain any sequence numbers, timestamps, or unique identifiers, or can an attacker replay the same withdraw event multiple times across different transactions to cause double-counting of withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Replay attack] If DepositFAEvent lacks transaction-specific binding (txn hash, sequence number), can a malicious validator re-emit the same deposit event in multiple blocks, inflating account balances and enabling unlimited minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Event reordering] Can an attacker manipulate the ordering of WithdrawFAEvent and DepositFAEvent within a transaction or block to cause balance inconsistencies, such as processing withdrawals before deposits to trigger underflow conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Cross-transaction replay] If identical DepositFAEvent data appears in separate transactions (same store, same amount), how do event indexers distinguish legitimate duplicate events from replays, and can attackers exploit ambiguity for balance inflation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Missing nonce] Since WithdrawFAEvent contains no nonce or counter field, can parallel transactions emitting identical withdrawal events (same store, same amount) be incorrectly deduplicated, causing legitimate withdrawals to be ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name validation] The MODULE_NAME is hardcoded as 'fungible_asset', but is there runtime verification that events are only emitted from the legitimate fungible_asset module, or can attacker modules emit spoofed events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name forgery] Can an attacker create a custom Move module with structs named 'Withdraw' and 'Deposit' that serialize identically to WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent, causing type confusion in event processing systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Const: MODULE_NAME] [Hardcoded string] The MODULE_NAME constant uses ident_str!('fungible_asset'), but if the actual on-chain module name changes (e.g., through governance upgrade), will the event type tag mismatch cause processing failures or silent data loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Const: STRUCT_NAME] [Name collision] If multiple modules define structs with names 'Withdraw' or 'Deposit', can events from different modules be incorrectly parsed as fungible asset events, causing cross-module data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [V2 event hijacking] Can an attacker exploit the MoveEventV2Type trait implementation to emit events with the fungible_asset type tag but from unauthorized modules, bypassing event emission authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event creation failure] The create_event_v2() method returns Result, but are failures handled safely? Can an attacker cause systematic event creation failures (e.g., through serialization errors) to hide withdrawals while deposits succeed? (High)"
