  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [State Divergence] Can inconsistent application of standardize_address across different indexer components cause the same address to be indexed with different formats, leading to duplicate records and query inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Timestamp Inconsistency] Does the indexer consistently use parse_timestamp vs parse_timestamp_secs, or can mixing these functions cause timestamp precision mismatches across indexed transaction data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Type System Bypass] Can property maps use both old (convert_bcs_hex with string types) and new (convert_bcs_hex_new with u8 codes) type systems simultaneously, causing type confusion in indexed NFT properties? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Error Handling Inconsistency] Do different utility functions use inconsistent error handling patterns (panic vs Option vs Result), causing non-deterministic failure modes across indexer components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Hash Collision Domain] Can hash_str() be used for different data types (addresses, token URIs, account names) without domain separation, enabling cross-context hash collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Truncation Before Hashing] If truncate_str() is applied before hash_str(), can attackers craft long strings that collide after truncation, bypassing uniqueness constraints in indexed data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [BigDecimal Conversion Chain] Can chaining u64_to_bigdecimal() and bigdecimal_to_u64() without ensure_not_negative() checks allow negative values to propagate through, causing integer underflow when converted back to u64? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Deserialization Fallback Chains] When deserialize_property_map_from_bcs_hexstring falls back to original value, then convert_hex is called on it separately, can this create multiple fallback layers masking deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Type Code Mismatch] Can token properties use type code 7 (address) in convert_bcs_hex_new but fail to apply standardize_address, resulting in non-standard address formats in indexed token metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Error Handling] [Unwrap Chain] Does the chain of unwrap() calls in remove_null_bytes (line 68, 70) create multiple panic points that can crash the indexer when processing malformed transaction payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Error Handling] [Expect Panic] Can the expect() calls in bigdecimal_to_u64 and parse_timestamp functions be triggered by malicious on-chain data, causing indexer to panic and halt processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Message Leakage] Do panic messages in parse_timestamp (lines 48-50, 55) leak sensitive version numbers or timestamp values that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Error Handling] [Silent Option Failures] Can the extensive use of ? operator and unwrap_or() throughout the file mask critical errors that should halt indexing, causing corrupted data to be stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Error Handling] [No Error Context] Do conversion functions return None without error context, making it impossible to debug why BCS deserialization or hex decoding failed for specific transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Memory Safety] [String Allocation Attack] Can an attacker cause excessive memory allocation in standardize_address by providing hex strings that require padding from length 2 to length 64, when processing millions of addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone Before Truncate] Does the clone() operation in truncate_str (line 24) cause unnecessary memory duplication when processing large metadata strings repeatedly? (Low)",
