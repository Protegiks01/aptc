  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: HappySlowPathMismatchError] [Cryptographic Key Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the happy path MPK vs slow path MPK mismatch by submitting malformed setup parameters that pass initial validation but fail during threshold decryption, potentially causing denial of service or fund locking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: HappySlowPathMismatchError] [State Inconsistency] If the happy path and slow path use different MPKs, can an attacker create ciphertexts that decrypt correctly on some validators but fail on others, leading to consensus divergence or validator set partitioning? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: HappySlowPathMismatchError] [Timing Attack] Does the error handling for MPK mismatches reveal timing information about which path (happy vs slow) was attempted, allowing attackers to infer private system state or validator configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: VKMSKMismatchError] [Key Material Leakage] When VK doesn't match MSK share, does the error handling inadvertently leak information about the MSK share structure or VK format that could aid in cryptographic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: VKMSKMismatchError] [Threshold Scheme Bypass] Can a malicious validator provide an intentionally mismatched VK during setup to corrupt the threshold encryption scheme, potentially allowing them to decrypt ciphertexts without sufficient threshold shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: VKMSKMismatchError] [Setup Phase Attack] During distributed key generation, can Byzantine validators trigger VKMSKMismatchError repeatedly to prevent honest validators from completing setup, causing permanent loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SerializationError] [Malformed Data Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious cryptographic objects that fail serialization in a way that bypasses upstream validation, potentially allowing invalid ciphertexts or keys to persist in state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SerializationError] [Consensus Divergence] If serialization is non-deterministic or platform-dependent, can different validators produce different serialized outputs, leading to divergent state roots and chain splits?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: DeserializationError] [Input Validation Bypass] Can malformed serialized data bypass type safety checks and cause DeserializationError only after partial processing, leaving the system in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: DeserializationError] [Code Execution Risk] Does deserialization of untrusted encrypted data perform unsafe operations that could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution if triggered before proper validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: DeserializationError] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker resubmit previously serialized ciphertexts that fail deserialization on newer protocol versions to cause validator disagreement or rollback attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricEncryptionError] [Nonce Reuse] If symmetric encryption fails, are nonces or IVs properly rotated before retry attempts, or can SymmetricEncryptionError lead to catastrophic nonce reuse breaking confidentiality? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricEncryptionError] [Side-Channel Leakage] Does the handling of SymmetricEncryptionError reveal plaintext length, encryption parameters, or key material through timing or error message differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricEncryptionError] [Failed Transaction State] When symmetric encryption fails during transaction processing, are partial encryptions properly cleaned up, or can they leak sensitive plaintext data to logs or error handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricDecryptionError] [Padding Oracle Attack] Can an attacker trigger SymmetricDecryptionError repeatedly with modified ciphertexts to perform a padding oracle attack and recover plaintext without the decryption key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricDecryptionError] [Authentication Bypass] If symmetric decryption fails, is message authentication still validated, or can attackers inject unauthenticated ciphertext that fails decryption but bypasses MAC verification?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: SymmetricDecryptionError] [Decryption Oracle] Can Byzantine validators intentionally trigger SymmetricDecryptionError and observe system behavior to function as a decryption oracle for other attackers? (High)",
