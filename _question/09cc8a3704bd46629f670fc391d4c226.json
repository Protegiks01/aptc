  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [All structs] [Parser injection] Can an attacker inject malicious clap attributes through environment variables or config files that override the hard-coded validators and defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: NodeAddressArgs] [Long option abuse] Does clap properly limit the length of --address and --chain_id arguments, or could extremely long values cause buffer overflows in terminal handling or logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Default value parsing] At lines 28 and 29, do the default_value_t and serde default use the same parsing logic, or could type confusion arise from different parsers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: NetworkAddress] [Upstream validation gaps] Does NetworkAddress::from_str() in aptos_types perform sufficient validation, or does this file incorrectly assume the type is already fully validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: ChainId] [Chain ID exhaustion] If ChainId is a finite type, can an attacker enumerate all possible values to probe for information about which chains are configured on the validator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: NetworkId] [Network ID injection] Does NetworkId properly restrict values to known variants, or can attackers craft custom NetworkId values through deserialization that access undocumented network interfaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Semantic validation] Does is_aptosnet_addr() check at line 65 verify semantic correctness (e.g., noise key matches expected validator key), or only syntactic correctness, allowing semantically invalid but syntactically correct addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Flag contradiction] Can no_handshake=true at line 34 be combined with specific network_id or timeout values that assume handshaking occurs, creating contradictory behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: CheckEndpointArgs] [Implicit assumptions] Does the flattened structure at lines 53-60 make implicit assumptions about field initialization order that could be violated when constructed programmatically vs via CLI? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Specification drift] Does the validation at lines 65-67 match the current Aptos network protocol specification, or could spec updates make previously valid addresses invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Timeout standards] Is the 5-second default timeout at line 28 compliant with Aptos network timing requirements, or could it be too short/long for certain network conditions causing false positives/negatives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Mutation after validation] After validate_address() returns Ok at line 68, is the returned NetworkAddress immutable, or can it be mutated to bypass validation constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: NodeAddressArgs] [Field visibility] Are the address and chain_id fields properly encapsulated with controlled access, or can external code directly modify them after validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Boolean coercion] Does no_handshake at line 34 properly handle only true/false values, or could integer values (0, 1, 2+) be coerced causing unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [All structs] [Macro expansion safety] Are the derive macros at lines 11, 21, and 53 (Parser, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug) from trusted sources and cannot be hijacked to inject malicious code? (Low)"
