  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Contract violation] Does the implementation properly fulfill the DBSubPruner trait contract, or could violations cause the parent pruner to make incorrect assumptions about pruning completion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [No batch size limit] The function creates a single SchemaBatch for the entire range - should there be a maximum batch size to prevent memory issues when pruning large ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [No timeout] The catch-up pruning has no timeout - can this cause indefinite blocking during initialization if the range is extremely large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Key collision] Could DbMetadataKey::PersistedAuxiliaryInfoPrunerProgress collide with other metadata keys, causing the progress to overwrite unrelated metadata or vice versa? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Version wrapping] The DbMetadataValue::Version stores a Version (u64) - if this wraps around or is corrupted to a very small value, could it cause the pruner to incorrectly restart from version 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Cross-pruner race] If multiple sub-pruners (e.g., TransactionPruner, EventStorePruner, PersistedAuxiliaryInfoPruner) are pruning concurrently, can race conditions occur in the shared ledger_db that corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Struct: PersistedAuxiliaryInfoPruner] [Shared resource contention] Multiple pruners share the same Arc<LedgerDb> - could this cause lock contention or deadlocks if they all try to write_schemas() simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Snapshot corruption] If a database snapshot is taken while prune() is executing, can the snapshot contain partially pruned data where some versions are deleted but the progress metadata is not yet updated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Backup inconsistency] If pruning happens during a backup operation, can this cause the backup to be inconsistent where it includes versions beyond the pruner progress, leading to restore failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Historical query failure] After pruning, if a client requests PersistedAuxiliaryInfo for a pruned version, does the system properly return an error, or could it return stale/incorrect data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/persisted_auxiliary_info_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Replay protection] If transaction replay requires PersistedAuxiliaryInfo for old versions, can aggressive pruning prevent legitimate replay operations needed for dispute resolution? (Low)"
