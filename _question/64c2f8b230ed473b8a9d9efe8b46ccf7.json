  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Module: pub mod error] [Access Control] Are the error types exported as public interfaces sufficiently restrictive to prevent external attackers from crafting malicious error states that could bypass consensus observer validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Module: pub mod logging] [Information Disclosure] Does the public export of logging module allow external code to inject false log entries that could mislead consensus observer diagnostics, potentially masking Byzantine validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Module: pub mod metrics] [Metrics Manipulation] Can the public metrics interface be exploited to artificially inflate or deflate consensus observer performance metrics, hiding malicious subscription patterns or validator misbehavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Module Structure] [Dependency Injection] Does the module's public API allow external components to inject malicious implementations of error handlers, loggers, or metric collectors that could compromise consensus observer security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] [Type Safety] Are there any unsafe type conversions or public re-exports that could allow attackers to bypass Rust's type system when interacting with consensus observer common utilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: InvalidMessageError] [Consensus Bypass] Can an attacker craft messages that trigger InvalidMessageError in a way that causes the consensus observer to incorrectly accept invalid blocks, potentially leading to safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: NetworkError] [Denial of Service] Can Byzantine validators intentionally trigger NetworkError conditions to force consensus observers into repeated reconnection loops, causing liveness degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: ObserverFallingBehind] [State Inconsistency] Can the ObserverFallingBehind error be exploited to cause consensus observers to skip critical block validation, accepting blocks without proper verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: ObserverProgressStopped] [Liveness Attack] Can malicious validators deliberately trigger ObserverProgressStopped errors to halt consensus observer participation, reducing network resilience? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: RpcError] [Error Propagation] Does the RpcError conversion from aptos_network::protocols::network::RpcError preserve sufficient context to prevent error masking attacks where Byzantine nodes hide malicious behavior behind generic RPC failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: SubscriptionDisconnected] [Subscription Attack] Can attackers force repeated SubscriptionDisconnected errors to cause consensus observers to repeatedly resubscribe, wasting resources and potentially missing critical consensus messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: SubscriptionProgressStopped] [Validator Censorship] Can malicious validators selectively trigger SubscriptionProgressStopped for specific observers to censor their participation in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: SubscriptionsReset] [State Reset Attack] Can the SubscriptionsReset error be exploited to force consensus observers to discard valid block data, causing them to request already-validated blocks again and creating resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: SubscriptionSuboptimal] [Performance Degradation] Can Byzantine validators manipulate network conditions to repeatedly trigger SubscriptionSuboptimal errors, forcing observers into degraded subscription modes that miss time-critical consensus messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: SubscriptionTimeout] [Timing Attack] Can attackers exploit SubscriptionTimeout errors to desynchronize consensus observers from the main consensus protocol, potentially causing them to lag behind and miss epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error: UnexpectedError] [Error Handling Bypass] Does the catch-all UnexpectedError variant allow critical security-relevant errors to be silently swallowed, potentially masking consensus safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error::get_label()] [Metrics Correlation] Can the error label mapping be exploited to misclassify critical errors as benign ones in monitoring systems, hiding Byzantine validator attacks from operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error::from(aptos_network::application::error::Error)] [Error Conversion] Does the error conversion from network errors lose critical security context, potentially allowing network-layer attacks to appear as harmless errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [Error enum] [Error Type Exhaustiveness] Are all possible consensus observer error conditions covered by the error enum, or could unhandled error paths lead to panic conditions that halt observer nodes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/mod.rs] [LogSchema] [Information Leakage] Does the LogSchema structure expose sensitive consensus observer internal state (like peer IDs, request IDs) that could help attackers map network topology for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
