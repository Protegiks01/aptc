  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Consensus Publisher Optional] If maybe_consensus_publisher is None on some validators but Some on others, can this cause inconsistent block propagation and fork detection issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Async Error Handling] Throughout async functions, errors are propagated with '?' operator - can partial failures leave the system in inconsistent state where some validators execute more transactions than others? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Batch Reader Interface] Does BatchReader trait properly validate batch digests, authors, and signatures, or can malicious batches bypass validation if they pass digest checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Transaction Determinism] Are all transaction retrieval paths (InQuorumStore, OptQuorumStore, InlineHybrid) guaranteed to produce identical transaction ordering on all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Gas Metering] When max_txns_to_execute or block_gas_limit are None, are there fallback limits to prevent unlimited execution, or can this cause validator resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Expiration Consistency] Are batch expiration checks performed consistently across all payload processing functions, or can some paths skip expiration validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Proof Validation] Throughout the file, ProofWithData and BatchInfo are used - are cryptographic proofs validated before transactions are fetched, or only during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Memory Bounds] Can a Byzantine proposer include thousands of tiny batches or a few massive batches to cause memory exhaustion during transaction aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Metrics Gaming] Can validators manipulate CONSENSUS_PROPOSAL_PAYLOAD_BATCH_AVAILABILITY_IN_QS metrics to inflate their perceived performance? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Transaction Signature Validation] Does the payload manager validate transaction signatures before returning them, or is this deferred to execution, potentially wasting resources on invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Global: Batch Duplication Prevention] Across different payload types, can the same batch be included multiple times (e.g., as both opt batch and proof batch), causing duplicate transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Empty Batches Vector] If batches vector is empty, does returning empty futures vector cause any issues in join_all() or downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Responders Empty] If responders vector is empty for a batch, can get_batch() timeout indefinitely waiting for responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Proof Clone Cost] Are proof_with_data.proofs cloned unnecessarily, and can extremely large proof sets cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [Payload Vector Ordering] Does the order of payloads in the vector matter for correct batch notification, or can reordering cause lifecycle issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: prefetch_payload_data()] [Prefetch Timing] If prefetch completes before get_transactions() is called, are batches cached indefinitely, and can this cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: check_payload_availability()] [Concurrent Availability Checks] Can multiple validators checking availability simultaneously cause race conditions in batch_reader.exists()? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Block Signers Usage] Is block_signers BitVec properly validated before use in process_optqs_payload(), or can incorrect BitVec size cause index errors? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_inline_transactions()] [Inline Batch Limits] Are inline batches subject to size or count limits, or can a proposer include unlimited inline transactions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_optqs_payload()] [Additional Peers None] When additional_peers_to_request is None, are there sufficient fallback peers to fetch batches, or can this cause availability issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: process_qs_payload()] [Empty Proofs] If proof_with_data.proofs is empty, does this return empty transactions or cause an error? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Byzantine: Malformed Payload] Can a Byzantine proposer create a Block with malformed payload that passes basic type checks but causes panics or errors during transaction retrieval? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Byzantine: Conflicting Limits] Can a Byzantine proposer set conflicting limits (e.g., max_txns_to_execute=10 but include 100 transactions) to cause validators to execute different transaction counts? (Critical)",
