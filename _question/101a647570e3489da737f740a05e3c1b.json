  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Struct: Command] [Input injection] Can an attacker craft malicious command-line arguments that exploit clap parsing vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary subcommands or bypass expected command structure validation, potentially executing unintended operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Struct: RootArgs] [Argument pollution] Does the RootArgs::parse() implementation properly sanitize all command-line inputs, or can specially crafted arguments containing control characters, path traversal sequences, or format strings lead to unexpected behavior in downstream server/configuration handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Enum: Command] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the Command enum's Clone and Debug derives to cause memory safety issues or information disclosure through crafted subcommand structures that violate type safety assumptions in the delegated run_cmd functions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Struct: RootArgs] [Resource exhaustion] Does the clap Parser implementation limit the depth and complexity of nested command arguments, or can an attacker provide deeply nested or recursive command structures that exhaust stack space or heap memory during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 8-15] [Command injection] Can malicious command-line arguments be crafted to bypass the subcommand pattern matching in lines 33-36, potentially causing the program to execute unvalidated code paths or access restricted functionality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Function: main()] [Tokio runtime misconfiguration] Does the #[tokio::main] macro configuration use secure defaults for thread pool size, stack size, and worker thread count, or can resource exhaustion attacks exploit unbounded runtime resource allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic safety] If RootArgs::parse() panics due to malformed input, does the tokio runtime properly clean up resources, or could panic unwinding leave the process in an inconsistent state that affects other node checker instances or the host validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] Does the Result<()> return type from main() properly propagate all critical errors from server::run_cmd() and configuration::run_cmd(), or could certain error conditions be silently ignored allowing the checker to report false-positive node health?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 33-36] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] Is the match statement on command guaranteed to be exhaustive, or could future additions to the Command enum introduce unhandled cases that cause runtime panics in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Logger injection] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables or process context to influence aptos_logger::Logger initialization in ways that redirect logs to attacker-controlled destinations or suppress critical security warnings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Information disclosure] Does the Logger::builder().level(Level::Info) configuration inadvertently log sensitive information (API keys, private validator data, node credentials) that could be exploited if logs are accessible to unauthorized parties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Log injection] If command-line arguments or parsed data are logged, can an attacker inject ANSI escape codes, format strings, or log forging sequences that manipulate log parsing tools or hide malicious activity in log files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Race condition] Is Logger::builder().build() guaranteed to complete before any logging in server::run_cmd() or configuration::run_cmd(), or could race conditions cause early log statements to be dropped or misrouted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Log flooding] Does the Info log level configuration combined with unbounded execution of checker operations allow an attacker to cause excessive logging that fills disk space, triggers log rotation failures, or impacts validator node performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 33-36] [Trust boundary violation] When delegating to server::run_cmd() and configuration::run_cmd(), are there proper security boundaries ensuring these library functions cannot escalate privileges, access restricted system resources, or bypass security checks implemented at the binary level?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 34-35] [Server compromise] If server::run_cmd() starts an HTTP server exposed to the network, can an attacker exploit vulnerabilities in the server implementation to gain control of the node checker process and pivot to attack the validator node it's monitoring? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 34-35] [Configuration tampering] If configuration::run_cmd() reads baseline configurations from disk, can an attacker with file system access inject malicious configuration data that causes the checker to approve compromised nodes as healthy, undermining network security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 33-37] [Return value tampering] Are the Result<()> returns from run_cmd functions properly validated, or could a compromised library function return Ok(()) while having failed to perform critical security checks, leading to false health reports?
