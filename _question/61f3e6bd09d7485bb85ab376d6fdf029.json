  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_item_iter()] [Merkle Tree Traversal] Can specific patterns in start_idx and limit values cause the Jellyfish Merkle Tree traversal to skip internal nodes, creating state backups that appear complete but are missing entire subtrees of state data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_range_proof()] [Epoch Boundary Exploitation] At epoch boundaries where validator sets change, can requesting proofs that span the boundary exploit differences in validator signature requirements to generate proofs with insufficient signature weight that shouldn't validate? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_root_proof()] [State Root Forgery] Can an attacker manipulate the state database to create a valid TransactionInfo with a forged state_root that differs from the actual state at that version, allowing backup of fake state that verifies cryptographically? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_epoch_ending_ledger_info_iter()] [Validator Set Manipulation] Can backing up epoch ending ledger infos reveal sensitive validator set transition information that could be exploited to predict future validator leaders or identify validators with lower performance for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [General: Database Consistency] If the underlying databases (state_store, ledger_db) use different consistency models or transaction isolation levels, can backup operations read from an inconsistent snapshot where some data is from version N and other data is from version N+1? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [General: Pruning Race] Can backup operations running concurrently with database pruning read partially pruned state, creating backups that mix pruned and non-pruned data in ways that cannot be restored consistently? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iter()] [Write Set Validation] The write_set returned at line 107 - is it validated against the transaction execution results? Can a corrupted write_set that doesn't match the transaction's effects be included in the backup, causing state divergence on restoration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iter()] [Event Consistency] Can the event_vec returned at line 93 contain events that don't match the transaction's effects, and would such inconsistency be detected or silently included in the backup, breaking event stream integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_account_state_range_proof()] [Proof Completeness] Can the SparseMerkleRangeProof returned by get_value_range_proof() be incomplete due to partially written Merkle tree updates, causing the proof to verify locally but fail when restored to a different node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_root_proof()] [Transaction Info Tampering] Can a compromised or corrupted transaction_info_db return a TransactionInfo with valid structure but wrong gas_used, state_root, or event_root values that would be accepted during backup but cause execution divergence on restore? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [General: Memory Safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or raw pointer operations in the underlying database implementations that could be triggered by specific backup parameters, causing memory corruption or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [General: Panic Safety] Can any of the ok_or_else() or unwrap-like operations in iterator chains panic under specific database corruption scenarios, causing the backup process to abort and leave partial backup data without proper cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_range_proof()] [Quorum Certificate Validation] Does the LedgerInfoWithSignatures contain a valid quorum certificate with sufficient voting power from the correct validator set for the epoch? Can returning ledger infos with invalid QCs compromise backup authenticity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_item_iter()] [Version Staleness] If version parameter points to an old state before significant updates, can the backup capture a stale view of the blockchain that's missing recent critical state changes like validator set updates or governance changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [General: Restoration Validation] When backup data is restored, are all the proofs, signatures, and state roots re-verified? Can skipping verification during restoration allow corrupted backup data to be written to the restored database? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iter()] [Zero Transactions] Can requesting num_transactions=0 cause the iterators to return immediately, but what happens if the caller expects at least one transaction? Is there proper error handling or documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_range_proof()] [Same Version Range] Can requesting first_version = last_version (a range of 1 transaction) cause num_transactions=1 but generate an invalid proof due to off-by-one errors in the accumulator range calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_item_count()] [Zero State] Can requesting a version with empty state (like genesis) return count=0, and would downstream code handle this correctly or attempt to create iterators with invalid parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_item_iter()] [Zero Limit] Can requesting limit=0 cause the iterator to complete immediately without yielding any items, potentially breaking backup chunk logic that expects at least one item per call? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_account_state_range_proof()] [Maximum Hash] Can providing rightmost_key = HashValue::max() (all 0xFF bytes) cause the range proof to include the entire state tree, potentially exposing more data than intended or causing performance issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_epoch_ending_ledger_info_iter()] [Single Epoch] Can requesting start_epoch = end_epoch return exactly one ledger info, and is the iterator logic correct for this boundary case or could it skip the epoch or return nothing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iter()] [Genesis Version] Does requesting start_version=0 (genesis) handle the special case correctly, including the genesis transaction and genesis state initialization, or can it skip critical genesis information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/backup_handler.rs] [Function: get_state_root_proof()] [Genesis State Root] Can requesting version=0 for genesis state root generate a valid proof, or does the accumulator at genesis have special handling that could cause proof generation to fail or return invalid data? (Medium)"
