  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: batch_open()] [Length mismatch] Does batch_open() validate that polys and rs (if Some) have matching lengths, or can length mismatches cause out-of-bounds access, panics, or use of wrong blinding factors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: batch_open()] [Challenge reuse] Since all polynomials share the same challenge vector, can an attacker exploit challenge reuse to create cross-polynomial attacks that forge batch proofs? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: batch_open()] [Large batches] Can an attacker provide extremely large polynomial batches (e.g., millions of polynomials) to cause memory exhaustion, slow verification, or integer overflow in batch aggregation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: batch_open()] [Polynomial order] Does the order of polynomials in the batch affect proof generation, and can an attacker exploit ordering to create proofs that verify but don't correspond to claimed commitments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: batch_open()] [Commitment key ownership] Does batch_open() take ownership of CommitmentKey instead of borrowing, potentially causing issues if the key is needed for subsequent operations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: verify()] [Challenge validation] Does verify() check that the challenge vector dimensions are correct, or can wrong-sized challenges cause verification to incorrectly accept/reject proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: verify()] [Transcript consistency] Does verify() rebuild the Fiat-Shamir transcript identically to open(), or can transcript state differences cause legitimate proofs to be rejected or forged proofs to be accepted? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: verify()] [Zero proof] Does verify() accept the zero proof (empty/trivial proof), which could allow attackers to claim arbitrary evaluations without valid openings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: verify()] [Special evaluation values] Can an attacker exploit special evaluation values (0, field order, infinity) to make verify() accept forged proofs due to degenerate verification equations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: verify()] [Batch verification bypass] If verify() is called individually on batch proofs, does it properly validate each opening, or can batch proofs bypass individual verification checks? (High)",
