  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Buffer Overflow] Can an attacker craft a StructTag with extremely long type_args that cause unbounded string growth in the write! macro calls, potentially exhausting memory or causing a panic that crashes validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [String Formatting Panic] Can maliciously crafted TypeTag values with special Unicode characters or control sequences cause the fmt::Write operations to panic, leading to validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Unbounded Recursion] Can deeply nested generic type parameters (e.g., Vec<Vec<Vec<...>>> with hundreds of levels) cause stack overflow when to_canonical_string() is called recursively, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Error Handling Inconsistency] The function returns Result<SmallVec<[Value; 1]>, std::fmt::Error> but is called with .expect() at line 68 - can this expect() cause unhandled panics if fmt::Error occurs, leading to non-deterministic validator behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Memory Allocation Attack] Can an attacker create type arguments with thousands of generic parameters causing the String allocation in 'name' to consume excessive memory, potentially causing OOM conditions across validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Type Confusion] Can the function handle malformed StructTag inputs where type_args contain invalid TypeTag variants, potentially causing inconsistent Value construction that breaks Move VM invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [SmallVec Overflow] The function uses SmallVec<[Value; 1]> with inline capacity of 1 - can this cause unexpected heap allocations in critical paths, introducing timing side-channels that leak information about type structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Vector Construction Safety] Can the vector_u8() calls with name.as_bytes().to_vec() and module.as_bytes().to_vec() create vectors that violate Move's vector size limits, causing downstream errors in Move code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [Address Validation] The function directly uses struct_tag.address without validation - can malicious addresses (e.g., reserved system addresses) be embedded in TypeInfo structs, breaking Move access control assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: type_of_internal()] [String Encoding Attack] Can non-UTF8 bytes in struct_tag.module or struct_tag.name cause the as_bytes().to_vec() conversion to produce invalid Move strings, breaking string invariants in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Gas Undercharging] The function charges TYPE_INFO_TYPE_OF_BASE before type_to_type_tag() but the comment at line 61-62 admits gas is charged AFTER expensive operations - can attackers exploit this to perform unbounded computation with minimal gas cost, causing validator DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker pass deeply nested generic types that make type_to_type_tag() extremely expensive to compute, but only pay the base gas cost, allowing cheap DoS attacks against validators processing transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Conditional Gas Charging] The gas charge at line 59-65 is conditional on eval_gas() > 0 - can this conditional logic be exploited to bypass gas charging entirely in certain configurations, enabling free expensive operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Integer Overflow in Gas] The expression 'NumBytes::new(type_tag_str.len() as u64)' casts usize to u64 - on 128-bit platforms, can this truncate large lengths causing massive undercharging for extremely long type strings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Non-Struct TypeTag Abort] When the TypeTag is not a Struct variant (line 67-73), the function aborts with NFE_EXPECTED_STRUCT_TYPE_TAG - can this abort be triggered maliciously to disrupt transaction processing or cause inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Type Argument Validation] The debug_assert at line 52 checks ty_args.len() == 1 but this is removed in release builds - can attackers pass multiple type arguments in production, causing undefined behavior or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Empty Arguments Validation] The debug_assert at line 53 checks arguments.is_empty() but is removed in release - can attackers pass unexpected arguments that corrupt the native function call stack? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Determinism Violation] If type_to_type_tag() produces non-deterministic results (e.g., due to concurrency), can validators produce different TypeInfo outputs for the same input, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [SafeNativeError Propagation] When SafeNativeContext.charge() fails (line 55), does the error propagate correctly, or can charge failures be silently ignored, allowing unlimited free execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Context Mutation Race] The function mutates SafeNativeContext through charge() calls - can concurrent native function calls race on context state, causing inconsistent gas accounting across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Type-to-TypeTag Conversion Safety] Can malformed Type values from the Move VM cause type_to_type_tag() to produce invalid TypeTags that break assumptions in type_of_internal(), leading to memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_of()] [Canonical String Explosion] Can type_tag.to_canonical_string() produce exponentially large strings for specially crafted nested types, causing memory exhaustion before gas charging happens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Gas Charging Race] The TODO comment at line 97-98 indicates gas is charged AFTER expensive operations - can this timing window be exploited to perform unbounded computation before gas is checked, causing validator resource exhaustion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [String Length Overflow] Can an attacker create type structures that produce canonical strings longer than u64::MAX bytes, causing integer overflow in NumBytes::new(type_name.len() as u64) and massive gas undercharging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Vector Size Limit] The function creates a vector_u8 from type_name.as_bytes().to_vec() - can extremely long type names exceed Move's vector size limits, causing runtime errors that differ across validators?
