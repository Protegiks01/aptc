  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Global Allocator] [Memory Exploitation] Can an attacker trigger memory corruption vulnerabilities in the jemalloc allocator through specially crafted gRPC requests that cause unusual allocation patterns, potentially leading to heap overflow or use-after-free conditions in the indexer gateway? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Global Allocator] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the jemalloc allocator have proper memory limits configured, or can an attacker send requests that cause unbounded memory allocation, leading to OOM conditions and denial of service for the indexer gateway? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Global Allocator] [Platform-Specific Behavior] Since jemalloc is only enabled on Unix systems, are there security differences between Unix and non-Unix deployments that could be exploited, such as different memory safety guarantees or allocation behaviors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Runtime] Does the tokio::main runtime have configured limits on task spawning, or can an attacker cause the gateway to spawn unbounded async tasks through malicious requests, leading to resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command-Line Injection] Can an attacker who can influence the command-line arguments passed to ServerArgs::parse() inject malicious config paths or parameters that load attacker-controlled configuration files, leading to arbitrary code execution or data exfiltration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration Loading] Does ServerArgs::parse() properly validate and sanitize the --config-path argument, or can an attacker provide paths to sensitive system files, symlinks to restricted directories, or paths with directory traversal sequences (../) to read unauthorized files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Handling] The Result is propagated but what happens to sensitive error information - can an attacker trigger specific errors in args.run() that leak configuration details, internal paths, or cryptographic material through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type Parameter] The IndexerGrpcGatewayConfig type parameter is hardcoded, but does the RunnableConfig trait implementation properly validate all configuration fields, or can attackers provide malicious YAML configs that bypass validation and configure the gateway insecurely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic Handling] While ServerArgs sets up a panic handler, can an attacker trigger specific panics in the initialization phase (before the handler is set up) that cause the process to crash without proper logging, enabling persistent DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Race Condition] Is there a race condition between multiple invocations of the gateway service if they share state through static variables or file system resources, allowing one instance to corrupt another's configuration or state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment Variable Injection] Since the ServerArgs framework uses Figment which reads environment variables, can an attacker who controls the environment (e.g., in containerized deployments) inject malicious configuration values that override security-critical settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Initialization Order] Can an attacker exploit the initialization sequence where logging is set up after parsing but before validation, causing security-critical events during config validation to not be logged, enabling stealthy attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal Handling] Does the tokio runtime properly handle UNIX signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT) to ensure graceful shutdown, or can an attacker exploit signal handling to cause abrupt termination that leaves the gateway in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource Limits] Are there OS-level resource limits (file descriptors, memory, CPU) enforced before starting the gateway, or can an attacker cause the gateway to consume excessive resources immediately upon startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Task Leaks] Can errors in args.run() cause async tasks spawned during initialization to leak and continue running even after the main function returns, potentially causing resource leaks or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Dependency: clap Parser] [Argument Parsing] Can the clap argument parser be exploited through specially crafted command-line arguments with excessive length, special characters, or unusual encodings that cause buffer overflows or parsing errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Dependency: anyhow Result] [Error Context Loss] Does the anyhow Result type properly preserve error chains and context, or can critical security error information be lost during error propagation, making it difficult to detect and respond to attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [YAML Deserialization] Since ServerArgs loads YAML configuration files, can an attacker craft malicious YAML files with recursive structures, entity expansion bombs (billion laughs attack), or arbitrary object deserialization that causes DoS or code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File System Access] Does the config path loading properly handle race conditions (TOCTOU) where an attacker replaces the config file between validation and loading, potentially loading malicious configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Escalation] If the gateway is started with elevated privileges, does it properly drop privileges after initialization, or does it continue running with unnecessary elevated permissions that increase attack surface? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration Validation Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the timing between config loading and validation by triggering errors that cause validation to be skipped, allowing invalid/malicious configurations to be used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [gRPC Manager Connection] Since the config specifies a grpc_manager_address, can an attacker provide a malicious address (e.g., localhost:malicious_port, internal network IPs, or SSRF targets) that causes the gateway to connect to attacker-controlled services? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Port Binding] Can the gateway's configured port conflict with other services, or can an attacker pre-bind to the port to prevent the gateway from starting, causing persistent denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [TLS Configuration] Is there validation that the gateway is configured with proper TLS/encryption settings, or can it be started in insecure plaintext mode, exposing indexer data in transit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-gateway/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Tokio Runtime Configuration] Can the tokio runtime be configured with insecure settings (e.g., minimal thread pool size) that degrade performance or enable DoS attacks through resource starvation? (Medium)"
