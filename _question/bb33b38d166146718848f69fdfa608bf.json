  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_EXECUTOR_SERVICE_SECONDS] [Communication Timing] Does the metric at line 62 properly track cross-shard communication time as mentioned in line 68, or can Byzantine validators hide malicious delays in cross-shard state synchronization that lead to execution inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: WAIT_FOR_SHARDED_OUTPUT_SECONDS] [Synchronization Attack] Can malicious validators manipulate the wait time metric at line 35 to mask the fact they're deliberately delaying cross-shard output to slow down block finalization and reduce network throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR_TXN_COUNT] [Transaction Censorship] Can Byzantine validators selectively exclude transactions from certain shards to manipulate the transaction count metric at line 53, hiding censorship attacks while appearing to process normal transaction volumes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTION_SECONDS] [Gas Correlation] Does the execution timing at line 19 correlate with gas consumption, allowing attackers to identify high-value transactions or expensive smart contract calls for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_EXECUTION_RESULT_AGGREGATION_SECONDS] [Aggregation Failure] If result aggregation fails and throws an error, will the timing metric at line 27 still be recorded correctly, or can error conditions cause metric gaps that hide system failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTION_BY_ROUNDS_SECONDS] [Round Failure] When a round execution fails or is aborted, does the metric at line 43 record partial timing that could skew performance analysis and hide Byzantine validator behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS] [Initialization Timing] Is NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS at line 11 guaranteed to be initialized before any sharded execution begins, or can race conditions cause shard assignments to occur with uninitialized or default metric values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_EXECUTOR_SERVICE_SECONDS] [Exponential Buckets Init] Does the exponential_buckets() initialization at line 71 happen before any histogram recording, or can early metric recording attempts cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS] [Shard Count Manipulation] Can changing NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS at line 11 during runtime cause transaction routing errors where transactions are assigned to non-existent shards, leading to execution failures and state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR_TXN_COUNT] [Imbalanced Sharding] Does the transaction count metric at line 53 detect when malicious validators create highly imbalanced shard assignments (e.g., all transactions in one shard) to cause performance degradation and consensus delays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Scrape Performance] Can frequent Prometheus scraping of all metrics at lines 11-74 cause performance degradation due to lock contention, affecting execution timing and potentially causing validators to fall behind consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTION_BY_ROUNDS_SECONDS] [High Cardinality Export] When exporting metrics with potentially thousands of shard_id/round_id combinations at line 43, can the memory and CPU cost of serialization cause validator performance issues during high load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [All Histograms] [No Cleanup] Do any of the histograms at lines 19, 27, 35, 43, 53, or 62 implement time-based or size-based sample cleanup, or will they accumulate unbounded data over the validator's lifetime leading to eventual memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTION_BY_ROUNDS_SECONDS] [Round History] Does the round_id label at line 47 keep historical round data indefinitely, or is there a mechanism to purge old rounds, preventing unbounded growth as the blockchain progresses through millions of rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Non-Persistent] Since these metrics are in-memory and reset on validator restart (line 52 comment mentions 'since last restart'), can validators exploit restarts to hide evidence of poor performance or malicious behavior by resetting their metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/counters.rs] [Static: NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS] [Configuration Drift] If NUM_EXECUTOR_SHARDS at line 11 is reset on validator restart but the actual shard configuration persists, can this metric/reality mismatch cause monitoring systems to miss configuration drift or attacks? (Low)"
