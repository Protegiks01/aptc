  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [AccountAddress Derivation] Does the function properly derive AccountAddress from the authentication key bytes using AccountAddress::from_bytes(), or can this unwrap() panic on malformed auth keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [Address Predictability] Can an attacker predict future account addresses before the corresponding keys are generated, allowing them to precompute transactions to those addresses or execute front-running attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [AuthKey Format] Does the authentication key vector format match what the Aptos blockchain expects, or can format mismatches cause account creation failures or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [Unwrap Panic] The unwrap() call on AccountAddress::from_bytes() can cause a panic - can an attacker trigger this by manipulating the RNG state or auth key to cause validator nodes to crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [Multiple Accounts Same Key] If this function is called multiple times with the same RNG state, will it generate identical credentials, allowing an attacker to create multiple accounts they can control with a single private key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Memory Zeroing] When a KeyGen instance is dropped, is the internal StdRng state and any buffered key material securely zeroed from memory, or can private keys be recovered from memory dumps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_private_key()] [Timing Side-Channel] Does key generation have constant-time properties, or can timing variations leak information about the generated private keys through timing side-channel attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_bls12381_private_key()] [Cache Timing Attack] Are BLS key generation operations vulnerable to cache-timing attacks that could leak bits of the private key through CPU cache behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_seed()] [Seed Exposure] Is the seed parameter securely handled and zeroed after use, or does it remain in memory where it could be extracted via memory scraping or core dumps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Key Material Logging] Can the Debug trait implementation for KeyGen accidentally log the internal RNG state or generated keys to debug logs, exposing sensitive cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_private_key()] [Spectre/Meltdown] Are key generation operations vulnerable to speculative execution attacks (Spectre/Meltdown) that could leak private key bits across security boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_os_rng()] [Memory Allocation] Does OsRng.gen() allocate the seed on the heap where it could be swapped to disk, or is it stack-allocated and more resistant to exposure via swap files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Thread Safety] Is KeyGen Send + Sync, and if shared across threads, can concurrent key generation operations lead to race conditions in the internal RNG state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Mutable State] Since KeyGen methods take &mut self, can improper synchronization when used from multiple threads cause data races in the StdRng state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_os_rng()] [Concurrent Initialization] If multiple threads call from_os_rng() simultaneously during validator startup, can they exhaust the entropy pool or cause OsRng to block/fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [RNG State Corruption] If KeyGen is wrapped in Arc<Mutex<>> for thread sharing, can lock ordering issues or panics during key generation corrupt the RNG state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_x25519_private_key()] [Error Propagation] Does the Result<> return properly propagate CryptoMaterialError to callers, or do callers unwrap() and cause panics on error conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_x25519_keypair()] [Partial Failure] If generate_x25519_private_key() succeeds but public_key() derivation fails, can this leave the system in an inconsistent state with orphaned private keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [Panic on Invalid AuthKey] The unwrap() on AccountAddress::from_bytes() will panic if the auth key is invalid - can this be triggered maliciously to DoS validator initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_os_rng()] [Entropy Depletion] Under heavy key generation load, can the OS entropy pool become depleted, causing from_os_rng() to block indefinitely or return weak entropy? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Global Instance] If KeyGen is used as a global singleton for validator key generation, can state corruption in the singleton compromise all subsequently generated validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_seed()] [Seed Persistence] If seeds are persisted to disk for key generation reproducibility, can an attacker with filesystem access read the seed and regenerate all validator or account keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_keypair()] [Key Storage] Are generated keypairs immediately encrypted before storage, or stored in plaintext where they can be stolen from disk or backups? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Struct: KeyGen] [Deterministic Testing] If KeyGen is used with a deterministic seed for testing and accidentally deployed to production, will it generate the same keys as test environments, compromising mainnet validators? (Critical)",
