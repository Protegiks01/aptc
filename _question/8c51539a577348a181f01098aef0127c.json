  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Cross-function] [State Consistency] If multiple native calls in the same transaction operate on the same SafeNativeContext, can state mutations from one call affect others, causing non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Cross-function] [Error Handling Inconsistency] type_of() uses SafeNativeError::Abort while type_of_internal() returns Result - can this inconsistency cause some errors to be handled differently, leading to validator divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Cross-function] [Type Parameter Sharing] Can type parameters passed to different native functions interact unexpectedly if they reference the same underlying Move types, causing cache pollution or side effects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Cross-function] [Parallel Execution Safety] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent calls to these natives from different transactions cause race conditions in shared caches or type resolution state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integration] [Move VM Type Cache] Can these natives pollute the Move VM's type cache with malicious or oversized type information, affecting subsequent transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integration] [Gas Schedule Changes] If the gas schedule (TYPE_INFO_TYPE_OF_BASE, etc.) is updated via governance, can existing transactions with cached gas expectations cause undercharging or overcharging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integration] [Transaction Context Injection] Can malicious prologue or epilogue code inject corrupted NativeTransactionContext that affects all native calls in the transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integration] [Module Upgrade Compatibility] If the TypeInfo or TypeName struct definitions change in a module upgrade, can existing native functions continue to work correctly or will they produce corrupted data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integration] [Bytecode Verification Bypass] Can these natives be called from unverified bytecode or during verification itself, bypassing safety checks and enabling arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Memory Safety] [SmallVec Inline Storage] SmallVec<[Value; 1]> uses inline storage for 1 element - can crafting scenarios where multiple Values need to be returned cause unexpected heap allocations that differ between validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Memory Safety] [String Growth Unbounded] In type_of_internal(), the String 'name' grows via write! macros without bounds checking - can this be exploited to cause heap fragmentation or allocation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Memory Safety] [VecDeque Usage] Functions receive arguments as VecDeque<Value> - can malicious VecDeque construction or manipulation cause memory corruption or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Memory Safety] [Value Ownership] When creating Value::struct_(), Value::address(), and Value::vector_u8(), are ownership semantics correctly maintained, or can use-after-free occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Memory Safety] [Struct Pack Safety] Does Struct::pack() perform bounds checking on the vec![] passed to it, or can incorrect vector sizes cause buffer overflows in the packed struct? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Panic Safety] [Expect Usage] The call to type_of_internal().expect() at line 68 can panic - are panics in native functions caught and handled gracefully, or do they crash validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Panic Safety] [Write Macro Panics] Can the write! macro calls in type_of_internal() panic on formatter errors, and if so, does this cause unrecoverable validator failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Panic Safety] [Unwrap Hidden] Are there any hidden unwrap() or expect() calls in the dependencies (type_to_type_tag, to_canonical_string) that can panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integer Safety] [Length Casting] Multiple calls to .len() as u64 - on platforms where usize > u64, can this truncate lengths causing wrong gas charges or buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Integer Safety] [NumBytes Construction] NumBytes::new() takes u64 - can extremely large type strings cause NumBytes arithmetic to overflow when computing gas costs? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Type System] [Type Parameter Validation] The functions assume ty_args[0] is valid - can invalid or uninstantiated type parameters cause type_to_type_tag() to return corrupted TypeTags? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Type System] [Generic Constraint Bypass] Can these natives be used to extract type information about types that should be opaque or private, breaking Move's type abstraction guarantees? (High)",
