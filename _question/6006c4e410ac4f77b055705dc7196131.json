  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Integer Overflow] Can the random range vec(any::<MultiplexMessage>(), 1..20) generate sequences that cause integer overflow when accumulated frame sizes exceed usize::MAX during serialization, potentially causing buffer overflow or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft MultiplexMessage sequences with maximum-sized payloads (approaching MAX_FRAME_SIZE) in all 20 messages, causing the buffer to consume 80+ MiB and triggering OOM conditions during fuzzing iterations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Serialization Bomb] Does the proptest generation allow nested or recursive MultiplexMessage structures that expand exponentially during BCS serialization, creating serialization bombs that exhaust memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Frame Boundary Attack] Can generated MultiplexMessages contain payloads that align exactly with MAX_FRAME_SIZE boundaries (4 MiB) to trigger off-by-one errors in the length-delimited codec frame handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Race Condition] In the async block using future::join(f_send, f_recv), can the socket be closed prematurely during concurrent send/receive operations, causing partial writes that corrupt the serialized message stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Panic Safety] If writer.send() encounters a serialization error for a malformed MultiplexMessage, does the unwrap() cause a panic that prevents proper fuzzer error reporting and masks exploitable bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Resource Leak] Does the MemorySocket pair get properly cleaned up if an error occurs during message serialization, or can repeated fuzzing iterations leak socket resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Codec Injection] Can the length-delimited codec (4-byte big-endian length prefix) be exploited by crafting MultiplexMessages that result in negative or extremely large length fields after BCS serialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [BCS Deserialization Attack] Does proptest's any::<MultiplexMessage>() generate all possible invalid BCS byte sequences, including those with mismatched enum variants, invalid UTF-8 in strings, or malformed nested structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Buffer Reuse Attack] After read_to_end() populates buf, is there any risk that buffer reuse across fuzzing iterations could cause data leakage or corruption if buffer isn't properly cleared? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Tokio Runtime Leak] Does using new_current_thread() runtime prevent proper cleanup of spawned tasks, potentially causing thread handle leaks as mentioned in the tokio issue comment (line 60-62)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [PeerId Collision] While PeerId::ZERO is used for the local peer to avoid OOM, can an attacker exploit the fact that all fuzzing iterations use the same local peer ID to bypass peer-specific rate limiting or authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Metrics DoS] The comment states remote_peer_id should be random to avoid OOM from metrics logging (lines 72-75). Can an attacker craft fuzzer input that causes metrics cardinality explosion despite the randomization, exhausting memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Mock Network Context Bypass] Does NetworkContext::mock_with_peer_id() properly validate that peer_id matches across all network operations, or can inconsistencies between mock context and actual peer behavior be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [ReadOnlyTestSocketVec Vulnerability] Does ReadOnlyTestSocketVec properly handle EOF conditions when fuzzer data is exhausted, or can it return undefined behavior that causes the Peer to misinterpret connection state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [ConnectionMetadata Spoofing] Can the hardcoded ConnectionId::from(123) and NetworkAddress::mock() be exploited to bypass connection tracking or rate limiting that relies on unique connection identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Protocol Version Downgrade] Does MessagingProtocolVersion::V1 with ProtocolIdSet::all_known() allow attackers to exploit deprecated or vulnerable protocol handlers that should be disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [PeerRole Authorization Bypass] With PeerRole::Unknown set in ConnectionMetadata, can malicious peers bypass access controls that should restrict operations based on validator vs. non-validator roles? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [ConnectionOrigin Confusion] Does setting ConnectionOrigin::Inbound affect rate limiting or validation logic, and can attackers exploit differences between inbound/outbound connection handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Channel Size Mismatch] The connection_notifs channel uses size 8 while peer_reqs uses QueueStyle::FIFO with size 8.
