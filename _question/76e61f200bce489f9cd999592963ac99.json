  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Rosetta Spec] [Error Codes] Do error codes from ApiError::code() comply with Rosetta spec error code ranges, or could non-standard codes break client error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Performance] [Network List] Could rapid network_list() requests cause CPU exhaustion from repeated chain_id.into() conversions and vector allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Performance] [Network Options] Could network_options() cause memory pressure from collecting all OperationType::all(), OperationStatusType::all(), and ApiError::all() on every request? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Performance] [Network Status] Could network_status() slow down during high blockchain activity when querying three different blocks sequentially? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Resource Management] [Block Cache Growth] Could block_cache grow unbounded if not properly limited, causing memory exhaustion in long-running servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Chain ID] [Injection] Could malicious chain_id values in server_context cause injection vulnerabilities when converted to strings for network_identifier? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Chain ID] [Parsing] Does ChainId::from_str() in check_network() handle all edge cases (negative numbers, overflow, special characters) safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Chain ID] [Comparison] Does chain_id comparison in check_network() use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks on network identification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty ChainId] Could an empty or zero chain_id value cause unexpected behavior in network identifier validation or responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Edge Case] [Genesis Timestamp] Does network_status() handle the special case where genesis block (height 0) may have different timestamp properties than regular blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Edge Case] [Block Height Zero] Could block_height being 0 (genesis state) cause the oldest_block_identifier and current_block_identifier to be identical, confusing clients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Edge Case] [Pruning Boundary] Could state.oldest_block_height exactly equal state.block_height (all blocks pruned except latest) cause incorrect oldest_block_identifier responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Edge Case] [Future Blocks] Could network_status() be vulnerable to time-based attacks where attacker requests status during block production, getting inconsistent state? (Low)"
