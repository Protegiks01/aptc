  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Event ordering] Can events be emitted in an order that violates state machine semantics (e.g., WithdrawStakeEvent before UnlockStakeEvent), confusing indexers and enabling front-running attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Event replay] Can EventHandle counters be manipulated to emit duplicate events with the same sequence number, causing indexers to process the same state change multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/stake_pool.rs] [Struct: StakePool] [Missing events] Can state changes occur (e.g., stake moving from pending_active to active) without corresponding events being emitted, causing off-chain systems to have stale or incorrect state? (Low)"
