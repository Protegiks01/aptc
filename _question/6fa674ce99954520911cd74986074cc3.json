  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Separation] Does main() drop privileges before processing untrusted bytecode, or does it run with elevated permissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Sandboxing] Is the decompiler process sandboxed to limit damage from potential exploits, or does main() run with full system access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input Validation] Does main() perform any input validation before delegating to Decompiler::run(), or does it blindly trust clap's parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Output Validation] Does main() validate decompiler output before writing to error_writer to prevent injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Capability Leakage] Can file descriptors or capabilities leak from main() to child processes spawned during decompilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Are the clap and codespan_reporting dependencies up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through main()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply Chain Attack] Could a compromised move_decompiler crate exploit the trust relationship established in main() to execute malicious code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Version Pinning] Are dependency versions properly pinned to prevent automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities in main()'s execution flow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode Bomb] Can an attacker provide bytecode that decompresses to enormous size during run(), causing out-of-memory crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Canonicalization] Does main() canonicalize file paths to prevent '..' traversal attacks before passing to Decompiler? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent Execution] Can multiple instances of main() running concurrently interfere with each other through shared state in error_writer or Options? (Low)"
