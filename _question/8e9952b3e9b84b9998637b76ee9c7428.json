  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/batch_transfer.rs] [Usage Context] Are there rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent the generator from overwhelming network capacity during benchmarks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/batch_transfer.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Vector Reallocation] When pushing SignedTransactions to requests vector, can repeated push operations cause excessive reallocation despite with_capacity(), degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/batch_transfer.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Clone Performance] Does cloning receivers from the pool for each transaction create performance bottlenecks due to excessive memory allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/batch_transfer.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor Validation] Should the constructor validate that txn_factory has reasonable default values (gas price, gas limit, expiration) before creating the generator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/batch_transfer.rs] [Struct: BatchTransferTransactionGeneratorCreator] [Lifetime Issues] Are there any lifetime annotations needed to ensure all_addresses Arc outlives created generators, or could premature dropping cause use-after-free? (Medium)"
