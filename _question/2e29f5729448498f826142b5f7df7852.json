  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Struct: NormalizedPath] [Type Confusion] Can NormalizedPath be confused with regular PathBuf in APIs, causing code that expects normalized paths to receive unnormalized ones, bypassing security checks in package resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Deref for CanonicalPath] [Immutability Bypass] Does the Deref implementation at lines 15-20 expose any mutable methods through auto-deref that could allow modification of the internal PathBuf, violating canonicalization guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: AsRef for CanonicalPath] [Type Coercion Attack] Can the AsRef<Path> implementation be exploited through type coercion to use CanonicalPath in contexts expecting regular paths, bypassing security boundaries that check for canonical paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Deref for NormalizedPath] [Mutation Risk] Does dereferencing NormalizedPath to PathBuf expose any APIs that could modify the path in-place, breaking the normalization invariant maintained by NormalizedPath? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: AsRef for NormalizedPath] [Security Boundary Violation] Can AsRef<Path> conversion be used to pass NormalizedPath to functions expecting Path, circumventing type-based security checks that distinguish between normalized and unnormalized paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq for CanonicalPath] [Comparison Inconsistency] Can two different CanonicalPath instances pointing to the same file through different symlinks be considered unequal due to path string comparison, causing package deduplication failures or double-loading of Move modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd for CanonicalPath] [Ordering Exploitation] Can the lexicographic ordering of canonical paths be exploited to manipulate package resolution order, causing older vulnerable Move modules to be loaded instead of updated secure versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq for NormalizedPath] [Case Sensitivity Issues] On case-insensitive filesystems, can NormalizedPath equality checks fail to match paths that actually refer to the same file, allowing duplicate module imports or bypassing uniqueness constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd for NormalizedPath] [Sort Order Manipulation] Can an attacker craft normalized paths with specific string properties that sort in unexpected orders, manipulating the sequence in which Move packages are processed and potentially changing compilation outcomes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Overall Design] [No Length Limits] Are there any length limits on paths processed by normalize_path() and CanonicalPath::new(), or can arbitrarily long paths cause buffer overflows, stack exhaustion, or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Overall Design] [No Content Validation] Does the file perform any validation that paths point to legitimate Move package files rather than executables, scripts, or malicious binaries that could be loaded as dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Overall Design] [Missing Sandbox Checks] Is there any enforcement that canonical and normalized paths remain within a designated sandbox directory for Move packages, or can they resolve to arbitrary system locations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Overall Design] [Thread Safety] Are CanonicalPath and NormalizedPath thread-safe when used concurrently across multiple validator threads during parallel package compilation, or can race conditions occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Overall Design] [Error Propagation] When CanonicalPath::new() returns an error via Result<Self>, how is this handled by calling code - can error conditions be exploited to skip path validation or cause unsafe fallback behaviors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Integration] [Dependency Resolution] When resolving Move package dependencies, can malicious paths in Move.toml be exploited to include arbitrary files as Move source code, injecting malicious bytecode into compiled modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Integration] [Import Path Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate import paths in Move source files that get normalized/canonicalized incorrectly, causing legitimate modules to fail loading while malicious ones succeed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Integration] [Cache Poisoning] If normalized/canonical paths are used as cache keys for compiled Move modules, can path manipulation lead to cache poisoning where malicious modules replace legitimate ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Integration] [Build Script Exploitation] Can paths resolved by this file be used to locate and execute build scripts or procedural macros, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution during package compilation?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Platform: Windows] [8.3 Filename Exploitation] On Windows, can short 8.3 filenames be used to bypass path normalization and access files with obfuscated names (e.g., PROGRA~1 for 'Program Files')? (Medium)",
