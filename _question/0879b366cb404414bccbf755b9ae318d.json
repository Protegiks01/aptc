  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Struct: EpochManager] [State corruption] Can a malicious validator exploit race conditions between concurrent updates to `epoch_state` (line 41) during epoch transitions, causing validators to operate on different epoch states and resulting in network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: epoch_state] [Consensus violation] If `epoch_state` is None when processing RPC requests in `process_rpc_request()` (line 99), can an attacker send crafted messages that bypass epoch validation and interfere with DKG protocol execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: dkg_rpc_msg_tx] [Channel exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the `dkg_rpc_msg_tx` channel (lines 48-49) with malicious RPC requests to cause memory exhaustion, validator crash, or prevent legitimate DKG messages from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: dkg_manager_close_tx] [Shutdown bypass] Can an attacker exploit the optional `dkg_manager_close_tx` (line 50) by triggering multiple shutdown sequences simultaneously, causing dangling DKG manager tasks that continue processing old epoch data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: randomness_override_seq_num] [Feature flag bypass] Can a validator with malicious local configuration set `randomness_override_seq_num` (line 60) to an extremely high value to permanently disable randomness across epochs, breaking consensus assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: key_storage] [Key exposure] Does `key_storage` (line 62) properly protect dealer secret keys from memory dumps or side-channel attacks, or can an attacker extract private keys used in DKG to compromise the entire randomness generation system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: vtxn_pool] [State sharing] Can concurrent access to the shared `vtxn_pool` (line 52) between multiple epoch managers or DKG sessions lead to validator transaction pool corruption or double-processing of DKG transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: network_sender] [Message spoofing] Can an attacker clone or replay the `network_sender` (line 56) to send forged DKG messages appearing to originate from legitimate validators, disrupting the DKG protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: self_sender] [Self-messaging attack] Can an attacker abuse the `self_sender` channel (line 55) to inject malicious self-messages that bypass network validation, allowing manipulation of local DKG state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Field: my_addr] [Identity confusion] Is `my_addr` (line 40) validated against the actual network identity, or can a misconfigured validator participate in DKG with a different address than its cryptographic keys, causing protocol violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization race] Can validators with different `randomness_override_seq_num` values (line 89) start with conflicting randomness configurations, causing some validators to participate in DKG while others don't, breaking quorum requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Key storage failure] If `storage(safety_rules_config)` (line 90) fails to initialize or returns invalid storage, does the constructor handle this gracefully, or will subsequent key lookups panic and crash the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel initialization] Are the event listener channels (`reconfig_events`, `dkg_start_events` lines 80-81) properly bounded, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by preventing event consumption while continuously triggering new events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker manipulate `rb_config` (line 88) parameters to set extremely low timeouts or high retry counts, causing the reliable broadcast protocol to fail or waste resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [Epoch validation bypass] At line 99, the epoch check compares `dkg_request.msg.epoch()` with current `epoch_state.epoch`, but can an attacker send messages with future epoch numbers that get queued and processed prematurely during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [Silent message drop] If `self.dkg_rpc_msg_tx` is None (line 101), messages are silently dropped. Can an attacker exploit the timing window when DKG manager is being initialized or shut down to drop critical DKG messages, preventing protocol completion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [Peer ID mismatch] The function receives `peer_id` parameter (line 96) and passes it twice in the tuple (line 102). Can an attacker manipulate these peer IDs to impersonate other validators in the DKG protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [Channel push failure] Line 102 ignores the result of `tx.push()` with `let _ =`. If the channel is full or closed, can this lead to silent message loss during critical DKG phases, causing protocol failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [None epoch state] If `self.epoch_state` is None, the comparison at line 99 treats it as non-matching. Can validators receive and process RPC requests before initialization, causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_rpc_request()] [Return value abuse] The function always returns `Ok(())` (line 105) even when messages are dropped. Can calling code incorrectly assume successful processing, leading to protocol state inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: on_dkg_start_notification()] [Event parsing failure] If `DKGStartEvent::try_from(&event)` fails (line 114), only a debug message is logged (line 118). Can an attacker inject malformed events that always fail parsing, preventing DKG from ever starting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: on_dkg_start_notification()] [Multiple event handling] The function returns after processing the first valid DKG start event (line 116). If multiple events are present, are later events ignored? Can this cause missed DKG sessions or protocol desynchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: on_dkg_start_notification()] [Channel unavailable] If `self.dkg_start_event_tx` is None (line 109), events are silently ignored. Can this timing window during epoch transitions cause validators to miss DKG start signals, breaking quorum? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: on_dkg_start_notification()] [Push failure handling] Line 115 ignores the result of `tx.push()` with `let _ =`. If the DKG manager's receiver is full or closed, can DKG start events be lost without detection? (Medium)",
