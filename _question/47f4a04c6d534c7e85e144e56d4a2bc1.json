  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: append_file_extension()] [Path Injection] Can an attacker craft a file path with embedded null bytes or special characters that, when combined with the appended extension, create a path pointing to a different file than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: append_file_extension()] [Directory Traversal] If the original file extension contains path separators (e.g., 'txt/../../../etc/passwd'), does the function properly sanitize this before appending the new extension, preventing path traversal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: append_file_extension()] [Unicode Exploitation] Does the unwrap_or_default() on to_str() properly handle invalid UTF-8 in extensions, or can attackers inject non-UTF-8 sequences that bypass validation when converted to strings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Race Condition] Between retrieving the account and using its data, can validator state change (e.g., sequence number updates from concurrent transactions), leading to transaction replay or nonce desynchronization attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Error Masking] Does the ApiError conversion preserve critical error information about why account retrieval failed (e.g., network partition vs account doesn't exist), or does it obscure important diagnostic details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_account_with_state()] [State Inconsistency] Can the returned State object be stale by the time the Account data is processed, leading to sequence number mismatches or authentication key inconsistencies in subsequent transaction construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_sequence_number()] [Replay Attack] Does the function verify that the sequence number returned is monotonically increasing and hasn't wrapped around due to u64 overflow, preventing replay attacks after 2^64 transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_sequence_number()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent CLI operations using the same account retrieve the same sequence number, causing transaction conflicts or one transaction to fail, potentially during critical validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_sequence_number()] [Cache Poisoning] If the client has caching enabled, can an attacker poison the cache with an incorrect sequence number, causing subsequent transactions to fail or be rejected by validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_auth_key()] [Key Rotation Attack] Does the function check if the authentication key has recently been rotated, or can an attacker exploit a TOCTOU condition where the key changes between retrieval and usage, causing transaction authentication failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_auth_key()] [Information Disclosure] Is the returned authentication key properly sanitized before being logged or displayed, or could it leak sensitive information about the account's key derivation or rotation history? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_feature_flag()] [Feature Flag Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit timing between feature flag checks and usage to enable/disable critical features (like consensus upgrades) mid-operation, causing state inconsistencies across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_feature_flag()] [BCS Deserialization] Does the get_account_resource_bcs call properly validate the Features structure, or can a malicious validator serve corrupted BCS data that causes deserialization panics or incorrect feature flag states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_feature_flag()] [Authority Bypass] Is CORE_CODE_ADDRESS properly validated to be 0x1, or can an attacker somehow redirect this query to a different address with manipulated feature flags, bypassing protocol-level feature controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: get_feature_flag()] [State Inconsistency] If different validators return different feature flag states due to state divergence, can this cause transaction execution differences that break consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: chain_id()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack return a forged chain_id, causing the CLI to construct transactions for the wrong network (e.g., mainnet transactions on testnet), leading to fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: chain_id()] [Integer Overflow] Does ChainId::new() properly validate that state.chain_id is within expected bounds, or can an extremely large chain_id value cause overflow when used in downstream calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: chain_id()] [Cache Inconsistency] If the REST client caches ledger information, can stale chain_id values cause transactions to be rejected after network upgrades or reconfigurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_map()] [Injection Attack] Can an attacker inject special characters in key or value strings that bypass the K::from_str() or V::from_str() parsing, potentially causing command injection or code execution in downstream consumers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_map()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker provide an extremely long comma-separated string that causes the split_terminator(',') operation to consume excessive memory or CPU, freezing the CLI during critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_map()] [Logic Error] Does the function properly handle edge cases like trailing commas, empty pairs, or multiple equals signs, or can malformed input like 'key=value=value' cause parsing errors that abort important operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_map()] [Duplicate Key Handling] When inserting into BTreeMap, if duplicate keys exist after parsing, which value wins, and can this be exploited to override critical configuration parameters by placing them in specific order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_map()] [Unicode Handling] Does the trim() operation properly handle Unicode whitespace characters, or can attackers use zero-width spaces or other Unicode trickery to inject keys/values that appear empty but aren't? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Weak Key Generation] Does the infinite loop properly maintain cryptographic randomness across iterations, or can repeated key generation with KeyGen::from_os_rng() gradually deplete entropy, weakening subsequent keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker request an extremely long vanity prefix (e.g., 60+ hex characters) that would take millions of years to find, causing the CLI to hang indefinitely and preventing legitimate operations? (Medium)"
