  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Schema: coin_infos table] [Version Ordering] The upsert WHERE clause checks transaction_version_created >= EXCLUDED.transaction_version_created - can integer overflow in transaction version numbers (i64) cause version comparisons to wrap and accept stale data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Schema: coin_infos table] [Timestamp Ordering] If two transactions create coins with the same coin_type_hash but different timestamps, will the indexer maintain consistent ordering, or can clock skew during indexing cause non-deterministic results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Schema: coin_infos table] [Foreign Key Integrity] Are there foreign key constraints between coin_infos and coin_supply/coin_balances tables? Can orphaned coin info records exist if related supply/balance data fails to insert? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Schema: coin_infos table] [Index Performance] Is coin_type indexed for the get_by_coin_type() query? Can queries on non-indexed 5000-character TEXT columns cause table scans that degrade indexer API performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Field: supply_aggregator_table_handle] [Null Handling] The supply_aggregator_table_handle is Option<String> - can None values cause issues in coin_supply tracking logic that assumes all coins have supply data, leading to incorrect total supply calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Field: supply_aggregator_table_key] [Data Consistency] If supply_aggregator_table_handle is Some but supply_aggregator_table_key is None (or vice versa), does this inconsistent state cause the coin supply indexer to fail or report incorrect supply amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Field: supply_aggregator_table_handle] [Address Format] Is the handle validated to be a proper 66-character address format? Can malformed handles cause foreign key lookup failures when querying aggregator tables? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Field: supply_aggregator_table_key] [Key Validation] The key is stored as TEXT without length limits - can extremely long keys cause storage bloat or query performance issues when joining with aggregator tables? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Concurrency: Database Upsert] During parallel transaction processing, can two indexer workers simultaneously insert conflicting coin info records, causing one to block on the primary key constraint and timeout the database connection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Concurrency: HashMap Deduplication] The coin processor stores coin infos in HashMap before batch insert - can race conditions during hashmap operations cause non-deterministic insertion order that violates transaction version ordering guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Concurrency: Connection Pool] Multiple queries via get_by_coin_type() share a connection pool - can long-running queries hold connections and prevent coin info inserts, causing indexer lag or complete stalling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Dependency: CoinInfoType::to_hash()] [Hash Function] The coin_type_hash is generated by hash_str() using SHA256 - can changes to the hash function in util.rs (e.g., to SHA3) cause all existing coin_type_hash values to become invalid, requiring full reindexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Dependency: CoinInfoType::from_move_type()] [Type Parsing] If from_move_type() incorrectly extracts creator_address from nested generic types, can attacker-controlled type parameters inject arbitrary addresses that appear as coin creators in the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Dependency: CoinInfoResource::get_name_trunc()] [Unicode Truncation] Does truncate_str() properly handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters, or can truncation in the middle of a character sequence cause invalid UTF-8 that violates database encoding constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Dependency: CoinInfoResource::get_symbol_trunc()] [Character Encoding] Can non-ASCII characters in symbol field (e.g., emoji, Chinese characters) cause truncation to produce visually identical but byte-different symbols, enabling token confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Dependency: CoinResource::from_write_resource()] [Deserialization] If serde_json deserialization of CoinInfoResource fails due to schema mismatch, does the error properly propagate, or can partial deserialization insert corrupted coin metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Error: Result Propagation] Throughout from_write_resource(), errors are propagated with ? operator - can error contexts be lost, making it impossible to identify which transaction/coin caused indexing failures during debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Error: Anyhow Usage] The function returns anyhow::Result - can generic anyhow errors from different failure points be distinguished, or will all errors be treated identically, hiding critical vs benign failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Strings] Can empty strings for name, symbol, or coin_type pass validation and be inserted into the database, causing display issues or query problems in indexer APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Edge Case: Maximum Lengths] What happens if coin_type is exactly 5000 characters or name is exactly 32 characters - are there off-by-one errors in string handling that cause truncation to 4999 or 31 characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Edge Case: Special Characters] Can coin names/symbols containing SQL wildcards (%, _), backslashes, or quotes cause issues in LIKE queries or display escaping in indexer APIs? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Version: Comparison Logic] The upsert WHERE clause compares transaction_version_created >= EXCLUDED - can this allow same-version overwrites if multiple writes occur at the exact same version, causing non-deterministic coin info? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Version: Genesis State] How are genesis coins (version 0) handled? Can attacker-registered coins at version 1 overwrite system coins due to version comparison logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_infos.rs] [Type: MoveType to String] The generic_type_params[0] is converted to string for coin_type - can complex nested generic types produce strings that violate database varchar limits or cause parsing ambiguities? (Low)"
