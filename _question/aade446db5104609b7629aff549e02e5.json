  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U32IdGenerator::next()] [DoS via ID exhaustion] Can an attacker spam operations that consume IDs to rapidly exhaust the u32 space and force wraparound, causing operational disruption when IDs are reused for active resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U64IdGenerator::next()] [Long-term ID exhaustion] While u64 exhaustion is impractical, if a validator runs for decades at high throughput, can approaching u64::MAX cause operational concerns or require migration strategies that aren't currently implemented? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U32IdGenerator::next()] [Silent failure] Since next() has no error return and wraps silently on overflow, can overflow conditions go undetected in production until they cause operational failures, with no logging or alerts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U64IdGenerator::next()] [Monitoring gap] Are there metrics or telemetry to track ID generation rates, current values, and proximity to overflow? Without monitoring, can ID-related issues accumulate undetected until causing critical failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Struct: U32IdGenerator] [Debug limitations] The Debug trait implementation only shows the current counter value - can this insufficient observability hide concurrency bugs or state corruption that would be visible with more detailed debugging information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U32IdGenerator::next()] [Protocol version compatibility] If Aptos upgrades to use 128-bit IDs in the future, can existing code using U32IdGenerator cause compatibility issues where new nodes expect larger IDs than old nodes can generate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U64IdGenerator::next()] [Serialization format] If IDs are serialized for network transmission or storage, can changes to the generator implementation cause deserialization failures or ID misinterpretation across protocol versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U32IdGenerator::next()] [Cache thrashing] Can malicious concurrent access patterns cause the AtomicU32 to thrash between CPU caches, degrading performance across all threads using the generator and potentially impacting consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-id-generator/src/lib.rs] [Function: U64IdGenerator::next()] [Memory bandwidth exhaustion] Under extreme concurrent load, can atomic operations consume excessive memory bandwidth, starving other critical validator operations and degrading overall system performance? (Low)"
