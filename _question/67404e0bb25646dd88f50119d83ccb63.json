  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Unwrap Chain] At lines 170, 182-187, multiple .unwrap() calls can panic - can any of these be triggered by normal network conditions or valid but unexpected data, causing the backfiller to crash unnecessarily? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Context Error Handling] At lines 76, 86, multiple .context() calls provide error messages but don't prevent propagation - can error chains become too long and consume excessive memory if errors occur repeatedly during retries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Silent Error Ignore] At line 191, Response::Status is silently ignored - can this hide important error conditions from the fullnode that should cause the backfill to fail or retry? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Panic Without Recovery] At line 196, panic! is used instead of returning an error - can this prevent proper cleanup of resources like file handles, network connections, or partially written files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Exit Without Cleanup] At line 103, std::process::exit(0) terminates the process immediately - can this bypass drop handlers and leave resources (file locks, network connections, temporary files) in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Progress File Atomicity] At lines 218-219, progress file is written with std::fs::write which is not atomic - can a crash during write corrupt the progress file, causing the backfiller to restart from the wrong version on next run? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Batch Boundary Inconsistency] Progress is updated at line 213 after tasks complete, but tasks may complete in different order - can this cause the progress file to reflect a version beyond what's actually been uploaded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: do_upload()] [Data-Metadata Ordering] Data files are uploaded before metadata - if readers check for metadata first, can they miss data files that were uploaded but don't have metadata yet, causing query inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [No Transaction Deduplication] If the backfiller crashes and restarts, can it re-process the same version range and create duplicate files with different backfill_ids, confusing readers about which data is authoritative? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [No Checksum Validation] Transactions received from fullnode are not checksummed or validated - can bit flips during network transmission corrupt transaction data without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Scope Lifetime] The tokio_scoped::scope at line 127 ensures tasks complete before continuing - but can spawned tasks outlive the scope if they block indefinitely, causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Upload-Fetch Ordering] The upload task at lines 151-158 and fetch task at lines 160-205 run concurrently - can the fetch task finish before the upload task processes all messages, causing tx.send to fail and lose data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [FileStoreOperatorV2 Mutation] FileStoreOperatorV2 is created as mut at line 133 but used in async context - can concurrent access to its internal state cause data races even though Rust's borrow checker should prevent this? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Channel Close Detection] When the fetch task completes at line 204, does the channel automatically close, or can the upload task at lines 151-158 wait indefinitely for more messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [Multiple Backfiller Instances] If multiple backfiller processes run simultaneously with different configurations, can they interfere with each other's progress files or file store uploads, causing corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [No URL Validation] At line 54, fullnode_grpc_address is accepted as a Url without validating its scheme or authority - can an attacker provide a malicious URL that redirects to an attacker-controlled server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [No TLS Verification] The gRPC client created at line 162 may not enforce TLS certificate validation - can this allow man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts and modifies transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: backfill()] [No Rate Limiting] Requests to the fullnode are made without rate limiting - although marked as out-of-scope for DoS, can an attacker use the backfiller as a proxy to amplify attacks against the fullnode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [File Store Access Control] At line 62, file_store is created from config without access control checks - can unauthorized users initiate backfills to arbitrary cloud storage locations, causing data exfiltration or cost amplification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Progress File Path Injection] At line 57, progress_file_path is user-provided - can path traversal attacks allow writing the progress file to arbitrary filesystem locations, potentially overwriting system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Negative Version Ranges] Although u64 prevents negative values, can ending_version < starting_version create logic errors that bypass the check at line 100 and cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero Task Count] At line 60, backfill_processing_task_count is not validated - can setting it to 0 cause the backfiller to make no progress, or can setting it to a huge value exhaust system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [File Store Initialization] At line 63, ensure! checks is_initialized but doesn't verify write permissions - can the backfiller fail later during upload due to permission errors, wasting CPU cycles processing data that can't be stored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Metadata Chain ID Mismatch] At line 66, chain_id is compared to metadata.chain_id - but can the metadata be stale or cached from a previous chain, causing the backfiller to operate on wrong assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Version Overflow in Progress] At line 94, progress_file.version must be a multiple of num_transactions_per_folder - can integer overflow in version arithmetic bypass this check?
