  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: From<JWK> for JWKMoveStruct] [BCS encoding mismatch] Does the MoveAny encoding produced by as_move_any() exactly match what Move expects during deserialization, or can BCS version differences cause rejection of valid keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Type name injection] At line 106, can an attacker craft a JWKMoveStruct with a type_name that contains SQL injection-like patterns or path traversal sequences that exploit downstream string processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Unknown variant bypass] The error case at line 117-119 rejects unknown variants, but does this happen AFTER potentially executing malicious code in MoveAny::unpack, allowing exploitation before validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [MoveAny::unpack exploitation] Can the MoveAny::unpack calls at line 108-109 and 113-114 be exploited with malformed BCS data to cause memory corruption, buffer overflows, or arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Error message information leak] The error messages at line 109 and 114 include the actual error details - do these leak sensitive information about internal state, cryptographic failures, or system configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Type confusion between RSA and Unsupported] Can an attacker provide a JWKMoveStruct where the variant.clone() data is actually RSA but type_name claims UnsupportedJWK (or vice versa), causing type confusion in downstream crypto operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Clone performance attack] The variant.clone() calls at line 108 and 113 duplicate potentially large MoveAny data - can an attacker create oversized variants that cause excessive memory allocation and validator slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Partial conversion state] If MoveAny::unpack succeeds but subsequent operations fail, is there any risk of partially converted state being cached or reused, leading to undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&JWKMoveStruct>] [Case sensitivity attack] The type_name comparison at line 106 and 112 is exact string match - are Move type names case-sensitive, and could case variations bypass the match and fall through to unknown variant error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Enum: JWK] [RSA to Unsupported conversion attack] Can an attacker exploit the fallback logic in From<serde_json::Value> to convert a weak/backdoored RSA key into an UnsupportedJWK that bypasses RSA-specific validation, then later use it as if it were validated RSA? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Enum: JWK] [Variant substitution in storage] Once stored on-chain as JWKMoveStruct, can an attacker modify the variant.type_name field through a separate transaction to change RSA_JWK into UnsupportedJWK (or vice versa) without changing the data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Enum: JWK] [Cross-provider key reuse] Since JWK ID comes from different sources (RSA uses kid string, Unsupported uses id bytes), can attackers create collision scenarios where a key from one provider matches the ID of another provider's key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [BCS version incompatibility] The CryptoHasher and BCSCryptoHash derives assume BCS compatibility - can BCS format changes between Aptos versions cause hash divergence for the same JWK, breaking signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Canonical serialization bypass] Does BCS serialization ensure canonical encoding (e.g., shortest representation) or can the same JWK serialize to multiple different byte sequences, causing hash mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Serde attribute exploitation] The serde derives on JWKMoveStruct - are there any serde attributes that could be exploited to inject malicious data during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Hash collision in CryptoHasher] What hash function does CryptoHasher use for JWKMoveStruct, and is it collision-resistant enough to prevent attackers from finding two different JWKs with identical hashes? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Move VM type confusion] When JWKMoveStruct crosses the Rust-Move boundary, can type information be lost or corrupted such that Move sees a different type structure than Rust expects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: AsMoveValue::as_move_value()] [MoveStruct::Runtime field mismatch] The Runtime variant at line 42 constructs a struct manually - can field count or type mismatches cause Move VM panics or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Move resource safety violation] Since JWKMoveStruct is stored in Move's resource model, can violating resource move semantics (e.g., copying instead of moving) lead to duplicate JWKs or key reuse attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Struct: JWKMoveStruct] [Gas metering bypass] During as_move_value conversion, is gas properly metered for the size of the MoveAny variant, or can large payloads bypass gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Function: From<RSA_JWK>] [RSA parameter validation missing] The conversion at line 46-49 doesn't validate RSA_JWK parameters - can invalid RSA keys (e.g., n=0, e=0, weak modulus) pass through and get used for signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Enum: JWK] [RSA kid manipulation] Since RSA_JWK.id() returns kid as bytes, can Unicode encoding tricks or null bytes in kid values cause string termination vulnerabilities when comparing JWK IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/jwk/mod.rs] [Enum: JWK] [UnsupportedJWK payload injection] Since UnsupportedJWK stores arbitrary payload bytes, can this be exploited to store malicious code, executable scripts, or buffer overflow payloads that get executed elsewhere? (High)"
