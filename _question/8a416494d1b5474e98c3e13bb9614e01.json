  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Non-Deterministic Resolution] Can environmental factors (network timing, DNS ordering, git server responses) cause non-deterministic lock file generation even with identical inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Time-of-Resolution Attack] Can the timing of when dependencies are resolved affect which commit is locked, allowing time-based attacks where malicious commits are active during resolution windows?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Version Pinning Bypass] Once a version is locked, is there any mechanism to detect if the actual package content at that version has changed (e.g., through rollback attacks on blockchain)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Lock File Verification] Is there any cryptographic signing or verification of lock files to detect tampering between when they're generated and when they're used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Reproducibility Guarantees] Does the lock file format guarantee that the same lock file will always produce identical build outputs, or can other factors cause non-deterministic builds? (Medium)",
