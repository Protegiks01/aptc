  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Arbitrary write] Does write_all(INVALID_NOISE_HEADER) allow an attacker to send arbitrary 152 bytes to any TCP endpoint, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in other services running on validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Connection state leak] After writing invalid headers, does the function properly close the socket, or can half-open connections accumulate and exhaust file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Error handling oracle] Do the different error paths in no_handshake mode leak information about the internal state of validators that could aid reconnaissance? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [TCP buffer manipulation] Can malicious TCPBufferCfg values (e.g., send_buffer_size=0 or u32::MAX) cause kernel panics or memory exhaustion on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Socket reuse] Is the TcpSocket properly configured to prevent address reuse attacks where an attacker binds to the same port immediately after disconnect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Connection drop race] When dropping the connection with 'drop(conn)', can a race condition cause pending writes to be lost, potentially losing critical consensus messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [FIN/RST handling] Does the function properly handle TCP FIN and RST packets during connection close to prevent half-open connections that could be exploited? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Error amplification] Can an attacker trigger cascading errors that cause multiple validators to repeatedly retry failed connections, creating a distributed resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Context leak] Does .with_context() accidentally include sensitive data from args or private_key in the error chain that gets logged? (Medium)",
