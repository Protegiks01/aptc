  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash length extension] Can attackers exploit properties of the underlying hash algorithm to generate collisions by appending specific bytes to string symbols? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Algorithmic complexity] If DefaultHasher has worst-case O(n²) behavior for certain inputs, can this be exploited to slow down Move compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Cache behavior] Can attackers craft strings whose hash values cause poor CPU cache locality, degrading performance through cache misses during linked list traversal? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Branch prediction] Lines 91-101 contain conditional branches in a loop - can adversarial inputs cause branch misprediction penalties to slow down compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Pool] [Memory layout] The Box<[Bucket; NB_BUCKETS]> allocation at line 68 may not be cache-aligned - can this cause false sharing in multi-threaded scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Lifetime elision] The returned NonNull<Entry> has no explicit lifetime - can this allow callers to hold references longer than the Pool's lifetime? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Borrow checker bypass] Using NonNull instead of normal references circumvents the borrow checker - can this lead to aliasing violations if insert() is called while NonNull pointers exist? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Panic safety] If string.into_owned() or Box::new() panics due to allocation failure, can this leave the pool in an inconsistent state with partially updated buckets? (Medium)",
