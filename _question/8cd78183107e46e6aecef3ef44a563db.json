Can concurrent modifications during DNS resolution cause race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Mut Socket Addr Safety] Line 151 takes socket_addrs[0] by value, then line 152 uses &mut socket_addr - is this mutation safe if socket_addr is derived from a shared reference? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_url()] [Fragment Preservation] Does set_port() preserve URL fragments (#...)? Can fragments be used to smuggle data or bypass security checks? (Low)",
