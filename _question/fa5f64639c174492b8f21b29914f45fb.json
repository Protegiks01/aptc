  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_proposal()] [Signature determinism] Are BLS signatures deterministic for the same BlockData, or can retry() generate different signatures for identical proposals, causing validation issues downstream? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_proposal()] [Round number manipulation] Can BlockData.round be manipulated to be extremely large, causing integer overflow in safety rules' last_voted_round tracking and allowing votes in past rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_proposal()] [Epoch mismatch] If BlockData contains an epoch that doesn't match the current safety rules epoch, does retry() properly handle this, or can it cause signing for the wrong epoch after reinitialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [Timeout certificate forgery] Can a malicious validator provide a forged TwoChainTimeoutCertificate at line 105 that passes initial validation but contains invalid signatures, allowing them to force unnecessary round timeouts and degrade liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [Timeout replay] If the same TwoChainTimeout is signed multiple times due to retry() at line 107, can these duplicate signatures be used to amplify timeout messages and cause premature round changes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [QC validation bypass] When timeout_cert is Some at line 105, is it properly validated before being passed to inner.sign_timeout_with_qc() at line 110, or can malicious validators provide invalid certificates that corrupt timeout processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [Round regression] Can the TwoChainTimeout round number be less than previously signed timeouts, and if retry() reinitializes state, could this allow signing timeouts for past rounds, breaking timeout safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [None QC abuse] When timeout_cert is None at line 105, does this allow validators to sign timeouts without proper justification, potentially enabling timeout spam attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [Concurrent timeout signing] Can multiple threads call sign_timeout_with_qc() concurrently with different TwoChainTimeout values for the same round, causing race conditions in timeout tracking? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [BLS aggregation attack] Can the BLS signature returned at line 106 be manipulated during aggregation with other validators' timeout signatures to create invalid timeout certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: sign_timeout_with_qc()] [Epoch boundary timeout] Can timeouts be signed at epoch boundaries where validator sets change, potentially allowing timeouts signed in one epoch to be used in another? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Equivocation] Can retry() at line 120 allow a validator to construct and sign conflicting votes for different blocks at the same round if the first vote is partially committed before reinitialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [VoteProposal validation] Does the function validate VoteProposal contents at line 117 before voting, or can malicious leaders include invalid block data, causing honest validators to sign votes for invalid blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Timeout certificate bypass] When timeout_cert is Some at line 118, can a malicious validator provide a certificate with insufficient signatures or wrong rounds, allowing votes that violate timeout rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Vote construction manipulation] Can the Vote object constructed at line 124 have its fields modified between construction and signing, allowing validators to sign votes with different content than intended? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Round monotonicity] Does construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain() enforce that vote rounds are strictly increasing, or can retry() after reinitialization allow voting for earlier rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Parent block validation] Is the parent block hash in VoteProposal properly validated against the last committed block, or can validators be tricked into voting for blocks on forked chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Concurrent voting] Can multiple proposals be voted on concurrently in the same round, and does retry() create race conditions where two votes are signed before either is persisted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Signature binding] Is the BLS signature in the returned Vote cryptographically bound to all vote fields, or can fields be modified post-signing without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain()] [Monitor timing] Does the monitor! macro at line 121 introduce timing side channels that leak information about vote decisions or safety rule state? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/metrics_safety_rules.rs] [Function: construct_and_sign_order_vote()] [Order vote safety] Can retry() at line 132 allow signing multiple OrderVotes for different orderings of the same transactions, breaking ordering guarantees and potentially enabling transaction reordering attacks?
