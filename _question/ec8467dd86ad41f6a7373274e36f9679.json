  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Import: StatusCode] [Dependency Trust] Does the dependency on aptos_types::vm_status::StatusCode on line 5 introduce security risks if that module has vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Trait: std::error::Error] [Error Chain Exploitation] Can error chaining through the std::error::Error trait on line 27 be exploited to cause stack overflow or information disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Trait: Display] [Format Vulnerability] Does the Display implementation on lines 21-25 properly escape special characters to prevent injection attacks in logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Struct: AptosError] [Thread Safety] Is AptosError safe to share across threads in the API server, or could concurrent access to error instances cause data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone Safety] Can the Clone derive on line 12 lead to security issues if error messages contain references to sensitive data that gets cloned unsafely? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: AptosErrorCode] [Error Code Confusion] Can clients confuse similar error codes (e.g., 101-109 all being 'NotFound' variants) leading to incorrect error handling and security bypasses? (Medium)",
