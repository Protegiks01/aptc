  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Access Control] Is there any mechanism preventing the DebugContext from being instantiated or used in production validator nodes, or can an attacker enable debugging on live blockchain execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Configuration] Are there compile-time flags or runtime checks that completely disable this debug functionality in production builds, or could debug symbols remain accessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Information Disclosure] If accidentally enabled in production, does debug_loop() expose sensitive validator state, private keys, or transaction data through stack traces and local variable inspection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: parse_number()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide extremely large numeric strings that cause integer overflow when parsed as usize, leading to unexpected behavior in step counters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: parse_number()] [Edge Case] Does parse_number() handle whitespace-only input correctly by defaulting to 1, and could malicious whitespace patterns bypass intended validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker craft malformed command strings with special characters or escape sequences that cause panics or undefined behavior in the FromStr parser? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: from_str()] [String Handling] Does the strip_prefix() logic properly validate that breakpoint strings are sanitized, or could null bytes or format string exploits be injected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker add unlimited breakpoints to the BTreeSet, causing memory exhaustion and DoS on the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Struct: DebugContext] [State Manipulation] Can breakpoints be set on critical system functions or consensus logic to pause execution at specific points, enabling timing attacks or state inspection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Breakpoint Logic] Does the breakpoint matching logic using starts_with() allow overly broad pattern matching that could trigger on unintended instructions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [DeleteBreakpoint] Is there proper validation that DeleteBreakpoint commands only remove existing breakpoints, or could malformed delete commands cause unexpected state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Information Leakage] When PrintStack command is executed, does it expose complete call stacks including private function details that could reveal internal Move VM implementation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Locals Inspection] Does printing local variables expose sensitive data like account balances, private transaction details, or cryptographic material in memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Code Inspection] Can an attacker use the debug interface to inspect bytecode of privileged system modules or framework contracts to find vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Enum: InputChecker] [State Transition] Can the input_checker state machine be manipulated into invalid states through race conditions in concurrent debugging sessions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [StepRemaining] Does decrementing the StepRemaining counter handle underflow correctly, or could it wrap around to usize::MAX causing infinite stepping? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [StepOverRemaining] Can stack_depth comparisons be exploited when the interpreter stack is manipulated, causing incorrect step-over behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [StepOut] If stack_depth reaches 0 unexpectedly, does the target_stack_depth subtraction (stack_depth - 1) cause integer underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Instruction Control] Can an attacker use Step/Continue commands to selectively execute or skip critical instructions, bypassing Move VM safety checks or gas metering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Infinite Loop] If debug_loop() is triggered repeatedly through breakpoints, can it create an infinite debugging loop that halts transaction execution indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Blocking I/O] Does the stdin read_line() call block indefinitely, and could this cause consensus timeouts or validator unavailability if debugging is active? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Struct: DebugContext] [Thread Safety] Is DebugContext thread-safe when accessed by parallel transaction execution in Block-STM, or can race conditions corrupt the input_checker state? (High)",
