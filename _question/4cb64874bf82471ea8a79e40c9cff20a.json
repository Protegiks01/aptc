  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Struct: ApprovedExecutionHashes] [Data structure vulnerability] Can the Vec<(u64, Vec<u8>)> entries field contain duplicate proposal IDs (u64), allowing an attacker to insert multiple hashes for the same proposal and cause confusion during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Struct: ApprovedExecutionHashes] [Memory exhaustion] Is there any limit on the size of the entries vector, or can a malicious governance proposal add unlimited entries causing memory exhaustion on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Hash validation] Are the Vec<u8> hash values validated for length, or can arbitrarily large or empty byte vectors be inserted causing validation bypass or DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Type confusion] The Move version uses SimpleMap<u64, vector<u8>> but Rust uses Vec<(u64, Vec<u8>)> - can inconsistencies between these representations cause state desynchronization across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Struct: ApprovedExecutionHashes] [Ordering dependency] Does the order of entries in the Vec matter for validation, and can reordering attacks exploit implementation differences across language boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Integer overflow] Can the u64 proposal_id field overflow or be manipulated to MAX_U64 to collide with legitimate proposal IDs causing hash confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Struct: ApprovedExecutionHashes] [Null hash] Can empty Vec<u8> hashes (length 0) be inserted, allowing any transaction with an empty script hash to bypass mempool limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Hash collision] If two proposals accidentally or maliciously have the same execution hash but different proposal IDs, can this cause security issues during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Function: to_btree_map()] [Duplicate key handling] If entries contains duplicate u64 keys, does collect() silently drop duplicates or use the last value, potentially allowing hash replacement attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Function: to_btree_map()] [Data loss] Can the conversion from Vec to BTreeMap cause data loss if duplicate proposal IDs exist, leading to approved hashes being lost and proposals failing to execute? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Function: to_btree_map()] [Memory consumption] Does into_iter().collect() on a very large Vec cause memory spikes that could destabilize validator nodes during config updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Function: to_btree_map()] [Ordering semantics] Since BTreeMap is ordered by key but Vec preserves insertion order, can this semantic difference introduce bugs in code that depends on iteration order? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Function: to_btree_map()] [Ownership transfer] Does the self consumption pattern prevent reuse of the config, and could this cause issues in code paths that need multiple accesses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Malformed data] Can a maliciously crafted on-chain state with invalid serialized data cause deserialization panics or undefined behavior during config fetch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker create a massive serialized ApprovedExecutionHashes structure that causes deserialization to consume excessive CPU/memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Deterministic serialization] Is serde serialization deterministic across all nodes, or can non-determinism cause different validators to compute different state hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Type confusion] Can deserializing a struct with the same binary layout but different semantics bypass type safety and inject malicious hashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Version incompatibility] If the struct definition changes in a protocol upgrade, can old serialized data cause crashes or security issues during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Nested Vec DoS] Can nested or recursive Vec structures in the serialized data cause stack overflow during deserialization? (Medium)",
