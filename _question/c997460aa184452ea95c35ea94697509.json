  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: decoder::token_coin_swap_list_token_for_swap()] [TypeTag Extraction] Can script.ty_args().get(0)?.clone() fail if type arguments are missing, and does the decoder handle this safely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: decoder::token_coin_swap_list_token_for_swap()] [Generic Type Validation] Does the decoder validate that coin_type is a valid Coin type, or can arbitrary type arguments be passed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Static: SCRIPT_FUNCTION_DECODER_MAP] [Lazy Initialization Race] Can concurrent access to the Lazy<EntryFunctionDecoderMap> cause race conditions during initialization leading to incomplete or corrupted decoder map? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Static: SCRIPT_FUNCTION_DECODER_MAP] [Key Collision] Can duplicate keys in map.insert() calls cause decoder overwrites, routing certain function calls to wrong decoders? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Constant: Module Address] [Address Hardcoding] Is the hardcoded module address (0x0...03) consistent across all functions, or can address mismatches cause transactions to target wrong modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Constant: Module Address] [System Address Security] Can the use of address 0x3 conflict with other system modules or be exploited to call unintended functionality? (Medium)",
