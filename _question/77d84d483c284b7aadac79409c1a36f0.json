  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_toml()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious TOML string with deeply nested structures or recursive references to cause stack overflow during deserialization, leading to denial of service or potential code execution when the prover processes verification requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_toml()] [Type Confusion] Does the TOML deserialization properly validate all field types, or can an attacker provide a config with mismatched types (e.g., string instead of number) that bypasses validation and causes undefined behavior in subsequent prover operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_toml()] [Injection Attack] Can malicious TOML input include special characters or escape sequences that could be interpreted as commands when passed to the Boogie backend or Z3 solver, potentially allowing command injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_toml_file()] [Path Traversal] Does the function validate the TOML file path to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd'), which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the validator node's filesystem?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_toml_file()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symbolic link that the config file path resolves to, allowing them to read sensitive files or inject malicious configuration from unexpected locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Struct: Options, Lines 37-85] [Unknown Fields] The serde attribute 'deny_unknown_fields' rejects unknown fields, but can an attacker craft TOML that uses valid field names with malicious values to bypass security checks in the prover pipeline? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_args(), Lines 539-541] [Output Path Traversal] Does the output path validation prevent directory traversal attacks where an attacker specifies '../../../sensitive/location/output.bpl' to overwrite critical system files?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_args(), Lines 542-551] [Verbosity Information Leak] Can setting verbosity to 'debug' leak sensitive information about the prover's internal state, verification conditions, or system configuration that could aid in crafting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_args(), Lines 552-562] [Vector Theory Bypass] Can an attacker specify an unsupported or malicious vector theory value that bypasses validation and causes the Boogie backend to generate incorrect verification conditions, potentially allowing invalid Move code to pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_args(), Lines 564-573] [Severity Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker manipulate the severity level to 'note' to suppress critical bug reports, allowing vulnerable Move contracts to pass verification and be deployed to production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/cli.rs] [Function: create_from_args(), Lines 575-585] [Source Path Injection] Does the handling of source file paths prevent injection of malicious paths that could cause the prover to read and process attacker-controlled Move code or arbitrary files? (High)",
