  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/measurements.rs] [Function: GasMeasurement::now()] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the underlying Prometheus histogram metrics (TXN_GAS, EFFECTIVE_BLOCK_GAS, APPROX_BLOCK_OUTPUT_SIZE, SPECULATIVE_ABORT_COUNT) before sampling to cause incorrect gas measurements that could lead to incorrect benchmarking data affecting validator performance assessments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/measurements.rs] [Function: GasMeasurement::now()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call GasMeasurement::now() concurrently while metrics are being updated, can this lead to inconsistent snapshots where some metrics are from one execution phase and others from another, causing measurement corruption?
