  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Thread safety] Does the trait guarantee thread-safe concurrent access to all methods, or can simultaneous calls from different consensus threads cause data races? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Reentrancy] Can trait methods be called reentrantly (e.g., callback invoking sync_to_target), and if so, are implementations protected against reentrancy vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Panic safety] If a trait method panics, can it leave consensus in an unrecoverable state requiring hard fork, or are there panic boundaries that preserve safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Integration] [Consensus bypass] Can an attacker exploit the StateComputer interface to bypass consensus voting by directly calling sync_to_target with a fabricated LedgerInfo? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Integration] [Execution stalling] Can malicious implementations of StateComputer methods deliberately take too long to execute, causing consensus timeouts and liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Integration] [State divergence] If different validators have different StateComputer implementations (due to software version skew), can this cause state divergence and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Integration] [Callback timing] Can the StateComputerCommitCallBackType be invoked before or after the actual commit to storage, creating timing windows for exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Integration] [Rollback coordination] If sync_to_target causes a rollback, are all consensus components (round manager, safety rules, proposal generator) properly notified and reset? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Type safety] [PipelinedBlock tampering] Can the PipelinedBlock references in StateComputerCommitCallBackType be modified through Arc interior mutability, corrupting committed blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Type safety] [LedgerInfo mutation] Can the LedgerInfoWithSignatures parameter in sync_to_target or callback be mutated after signature verification, invalidating the signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Type safety] [EpochState lifetime] Does EpochState ownership in new_epoch() prevent use-after-free bugs if the reference is used after epoch transition? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Parameter validation] [Null duration] Can Duration::from_secs(0) be passed to sync_for_duration(), and if so, does it skip synchronization entirely or does it validate for minimum duration? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Parameter validation] [Invalid epoch state] Can new_epoch() accept an EpochState with empty validator set, zero total stake, or invalid cryptographic parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Concurrency] [Sync race] Can sync_for_duration() and sync_to_target() race against each other, causing the validator to sync to two different targets simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Concurrency] [Epoch transition race] Can new_epoch() be called while sync_to_target() is in progress, causing the sync to complete with stale epoch configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Concurrency] [Callback race] If StateComputerCommitCallBackType is invoked concurrently with end_epoch(), can the callback access freed epoch state causing use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock ordering] Do implementations use consistent lock ordering across methods, or can deadlocks occur when multiple methods are called concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Error handling] [Partial sync failure] If sync_to_target() fails after partially syncing (e.g., downloaded chunks but failed commit), is rollback guaranteed or can state be corrupted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Error handling] [Error propagation] Do StateSyncError details leak sensitive information about validator state or network topology that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Error handling] [Retry semantics] If sync_for_duration() returns an error, is it safe to retry immediately, or can rapid retries amplify issues or cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Error handling] [Poison state] Can a sequence of method calls and errors leave the StateComputer in a 'poisoned' state where all future operations fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [State sync attack] [Eclipse attack] Can an attacker control sync_to_target() targets to isolate a validator on a forked chain with valid signatures but different transaction history? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [State sync attack] [Slow sync DoS] Can an attacker force validators into repeated long-running sync_for_duration() calls, preventing them from participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [State sync attack] [Sync loop] Can sync methods be exploited to create an infinite loop where validators continuously sync without ever catching up to current state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [State sync attack] [Chain rollback] Can sync_to_target() be used to rollback the chain to before a validator rotation, allowing removed validators to continue signing blocks? (Critical)"
