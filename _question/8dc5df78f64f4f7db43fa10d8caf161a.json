  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Field: metadata] [Self-reference] Can metadata point to the store's own address, creating a circular reference that causes infinite loops in asset property lookups? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: FungibleStoreResource] [Double free] In unsafe code paths, can FungibleStoreResource be freed twice, corrupting memory and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: FungibleStoreResource] [Non-deterministic hash] If FungibleStoreResource hashing is non-deterministic (e.g., due to memory layout), can this cause state root divergence across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: FungibleStoreResource] [Serialization order] Does BCS serialization maintain consistent field ordering (metadata, balance, frozen)? Can reordering cause consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource] [Aggregator determinism] Are AggregatorResource operations deterministic across all validators, or can concurrent updates produce different final values? (Critical)",
