  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_bls12381_private_key()] [Validator Consensus] Are BLS keys only used for consensus (validator signatures), or can they be misused for transaction signing, breaking security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_keypair()] [Governance Keys] If validator governance keys are generated using this module, can key compromise enable hostile governance proposals or protocol downgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_bls12381_private_key()] [Key Rotation] During validator key rotation, are old keys properly revoked, or can attackers continue using compromised old keys for some operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_seed()] [Seed Backup] If seeds are backed up for disaster recovery, are backups encrypted, or can backup theft compromise all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_keypair()] [HSM Integration] Can this key generation module be used with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), or does it require keys to be generated in software where they're more vulnerable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_x25519_keypair()] [Network Encryption] Are X25519 keys used for validator-to-validator network encryption, and can weak key generation enable MITM attacks on consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_x25519_keypair()] [Session Keys] If X25519 keys are used as ephemeral session keys, is there a mechanism to rotate them frequently, or can long-lived keys be compromised over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_keypair()] [Peer Authentication] Are Ed25519 keys used for peer authentication in the P2P network, and can key impersonation enable sybil attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_bls12381_private_key()] [BLS Key Encoding] Are BLS private keys encoded in big-endian or little-endian format, and can endianness confusion cause cross-platform compatibility issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_private_key()] [RFC 8032 Compliance] Does the Ed25519 implementation strictly follow RFC 8032, or are there deviations that could cause signature incompatibility with other Ed25519 implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_x25519_private_key()] [RFC 7748 Compliance] Is the X25519 implementation compliant with RFC 7748, ensuring interoperability with standard X25519 implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_credentials_for_account_creation()] [Hash Function] What hash function is used in AuthenticationKey::ed25519(), and is it collision-resistant enough for account address derivation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_ed25519_keypair()] [Key Expiration] Do generated keys have expiration dates or validity periods, or can compromised keys remain valid indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_bls12381_private_key()] [Key Revocation] If a validator's BLS key is compromised, is there a mechanism to revoke it and prevent its use in future consensus rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-keygen/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_seed()] [Seed Auditing] Are seed generation events logged for security auditing, or can malicious seed manipulation go undetected? (Medium)"
