  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Metric Registration] [Resource exhaustion] If metric registration via register_*_vec!() fails due to duplicate names or system limits, does the .unwrap() cause validator node crashes during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: start_serialization_timer()] [Resource exhaustion] Can attackers trigger excessive serialization_timer creation without stopping timers, leaking HistogramTimer objects and exhausting memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Histogram Buckets] [Resource exhaustion] The exponential_buckets() calls in NETWORK_APPLICATION_SERIALIZATION_METRIC and INBOUND_QUEUE_DELAY create 20-30 buckets - can many concurrent protocol_id values cause memory exhaustion through histogram proliferation? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: peer_connected()] [Validator-only logic] The peer_connected() function only updates metrics for validator networks via is_validator_network() check - can this conditional lead to incomplete monitoring of critical validator connections enabling undetected network partitions? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: peer_connected()] [Inconsistent state] If is_validator_network() returns false for some validator nodes due to misconfiguration, will peer_connected() skip metric updates causing incomplete network graphs and undetected Byzantine nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: direct_send_messages()] [Metric poisoning] Can malicious code intentionally inflate direct_send_messages() counters with fake state labels to mask actual message failures or DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: connections_rejected()] [Metric poisoning] Can Byzantine nodes repeatedly fail connection handshakes to inflate connections_rejected() metrics, triggering false alerts and masking legitimate connection failures? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Metric: INVALID_NETWORK_MESSAGES] [Metric poisoning] Does INVALID_NETWORK_MESSAGES counter incrementation properly distinguish between legitimate invalid messages and attacker-generated noise, or can this be exploited to hide real attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PEER_SEND_FAILURES] [Metric poisoning] Can a compromised peer artificially inflate PEER_SEND_FAILURES to make honest validators appear faulty, triggering incorrect validator reputation penalties? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: connections()] [Network context confusion] If NetworkContext contains inconsistent role/network_id/peer_id values, can this cause metrics to be attributed to wrong network types, confusing validator metrics with public network metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: update_network_connection_operation_metrics()] [Network isolation] Does update_network_connection_operation_metrics() properly isolate metrics between validator and public networks, or can cross-contamination occur through shared operation labels? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: rpc_bytes()] [Network isolation] Can metrics from different network_id values be confused if network_id strings are manipulated, causing validator network RPC byte counts to be attributed to public networks? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: outbound_rpc_request_latency()] [Protocol confusion] Does protocol_id.as_str() properly validate ProtocolId values, or can malformed protocol IDs cause metric collisions between different protocols? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: inbound_rpc_handler_latency()] [Protocol confusion] If ProtocolId enum is extended with new protocols, can missing metric registration cause .unwrap() panics in inbound_rpc_handler_latency()? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Metric: INBOUND_QUEUE_DELAY] [Timing disclosure] Does INBOUND_QUEUE_DELAY expose queue congestion patterns that attackers can exploit to determine optimal timing for consensus disruption attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [State Labels] [Invalid states] Are the state label constants (CANCELED_LABEL, DECLINED_LABEL, EXPIRED_LABEL, etc.) exhaustively checked, or can functions accept arbitrary state strings causing undefined metric behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: rpc_messages()] [State validation] Does rpc_messages() validate that state_label is one of the defined constants, or can callers pass arbitrary state strings causing metric cardinality issues? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/counters.rs] [Function: direct_send_messages()] [State consistency] Can state_label mismatches between direct_send_messages() and direct_send_bytes() calls cause inconsistent metrics showing message counts and byte counts with different state distributions? (Low)",
