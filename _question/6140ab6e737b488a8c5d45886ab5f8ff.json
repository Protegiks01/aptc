  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Integer Overflow] Can the time calculation on line 14 using `as_micros() as f64` overflow or lose precision when measuring very long-running async operations (>584 years in microseconds), potentially causing incorrect performance metrics or test failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Time Manipulation] Can system clock adjustments (NTP sync, manual changes) during macro execution between lines 8 and 14 cause negative time deltas or incorrect measurements, leading to test suite instability or false performance regressions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Precision Loss] Does the conversion from microseconds (u128) to f64 on line 14 lose precision for timing measurements, potentially masking performance degradation in critical API operations during testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Race Condition] Can concurrent invocations of time_fn! macro in parallel test execution interfere with each other's timing measurements through shared tokio runtime state, causing non-deterministic test results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Timer Resolution] Does tokio::time::Instant on lines 8 and 14 provide sufficient resolution to detect sub-microsecond performance regressions in critical API paths, or can timing inaccuracies hide security-relevant performance bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Panic Handling] If the async function call on line 11 panics, is the panic properly propagated, or does the macro swallow critical error information that could indicate security issues in the tested API? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Async Cancellation] If the Future on line 11 is cancelled or dropped before completion, does the macro handle this safely without leaving dangling resources or corrupted test state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Error Propagation] Does the macro correctly preserve error types and contexts from the wrapped function (line 11), or could error masking hide critical API security failures during testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Side Effects] Can side effects from the timed function call on line 11 (database mutations, network calls) cause test pollution affecting subsequent API security tests, creating false negatives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Variable Shadowing] Can variable name collisions with 'start', 'result', or 'time' in calling code cause the macro (lines 8, 11, 14) to behave unexpectedly or capture wrong values in API security tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Token Injection] Could malicious or malformed macro arguments ($func, $arg) be injected to execute arbitrary code or bypass test security checks, compromising the integrity of the API test suite? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Argument Evaluation] Are the macro arguments ($arg on line 11) evaluated exactly once, or could multiple evaluations cause unintended side effects or state mutations in API security tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Type Safety] Does the macro enforce that $func returns a Future, or could type mismatches on line 11 cause compile-time errors that are difficult to diagnose, slowing security test development? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Performance Overhead] Does the timing instrumentation itself (lines 8-14) introduce measurable overhead that affects the behavior of time-sensitive API operations under test, potentially hiding race conditions or timing-based vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Memory Allocation] Can repeated macro invocations in long-running test suites cause memory pressure or allocation patterns that mask memory-related API vulnerabilities during security testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Test Determinism] Does the macro's timing mechanism (Instant::now() on lines 8 and 14) introduce non-determinism that makes security regression tests unreliable or creates flaky test results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Result Handling] If the wrapped function returns a Result type, does the macro properly handle both Ok and Err cases without affecting error propagation in API security validation tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Runtime Compatibility] Is the macro's use of tokio::time::Instant (lines 8, 14) compatible with all tokio runtime configurations used in production, or could runtime mismatches cause test results that don't reflect production API behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Executor Context] Does the macro assume a specific async executor context that might not be present in all test scenarios, potentially causing panics or incorrect timing in distributed API testing setups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Zero-Time Operations] How does the macro handle operations that complete in zero measured time (line 14), and could this cause division-by-zero or other mathematical errors in downstream performance analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/macros.rs] [Macro: time_fn!] [Argument Count] Does the macro properly handle variable argument counts ($(arg),*), including zero arguments, or could incorrect argument handling cause test compilation failures? (Low)",
