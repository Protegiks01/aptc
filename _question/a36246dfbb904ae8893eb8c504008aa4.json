  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Consensus Impact] [Fragment Loss] If fragments are lost (channel overflow at lines 221/230), and there's no retransmission, could critical consensus messages be dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Edge Case] [Single Fragment Stream] If num_fragments = 1, does the logic handle this correctly? The first fragment would have fragment_id = 1, matching current_fragment_id + 1. (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Message] Can a NetworkMessage have data_len() = 0? Would this cause division by zero or unexpected behavior in chunk calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Frame Size] If max_frame_size = 1, would chunking work correctly? Each chunk would be 1 byte - could this cause performance issues or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Edge Case] [Exact Boundary] If message size is exactly N * max_frame_size, does split_off() and chunks() produce exactly N fragments? Off-by-one? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Edge Case] [U8 MAX Fragments] If a stream legitimately needs 255 fragments, does the increment at line 138 handle fragment_id = 255 correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Resource Attack] [Memory Amplification] Can an attacker send many small headers claiming large num_fragments values to reserve memory without sending actual fragments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Resource Attack] [CPU Exhaustion] Repeated stream replacement (line 77) and fragment validation (lines 129-137) could consume CPU - is there rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Resource Attack] [Channel Overflow] If stream_tx channel (line 154) has a bounded capacity, can fragment sending (line 230) block indefinitely during backpressure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Resource Attack] [Allocation Frequency] Vec::from() at line 228 allocates for every fragment - for high-throughput scenarios, could this cause allocator contention? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type Safety] [Enum Match Exhaustiveness] The match at lines 140-145 covers all NetworkMessage variants - but if NetworkMessage is extended, would compilation fail or would new variants hit the panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type Safety] [Option Unwrap] Line 95 calls unwrap() assuming stream is Some - while the logic appears safe, could concurrent access violate this assumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type Safety] [Mutable Reference] append_fragment() takes &mut self (line 127) - could multiple mutable references exist if called from async contexts incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type Safety] [Vec Ownership] Vec::append() (lines 142-145) requires mutable access to both vectors - could this violate borrow checker rules in complex scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Debug Implementation] [Info Leakage] Debug implementations (lines 39-59) expose request_id, fragment_id, size - could this leak sensitive information in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Debug Implementation] [Log Injection] If message content is included in debug output, could malicious messages inject log formatting attacks? (Low)"
