  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_list()] [Information Disclosure] Does network_list() expose the server's chain_id without any authentication, allowing attackers to fingerprint and target specific networks for chain-specific exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_list()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker send malformed MetadataRequest objects to network_list() that bypass validation, potentially causing panics or unexpected behavior in the response serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_list()] [State Consistency] Does network_list() read server_context.chain_id atomically, or can race conditions during chain_id updates cause it to return inconsistent network identifiers across concurrent requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_list()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker flood network_list() with rapid requests to exhaust memory by creating many NetworkListResponse objects with large network_identifiers vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_list()] [Error Handling] If server_context.chain_id contains invalid or corrupted data during conversion to NetworkIdentifier, does network_list() properly handle the error or could it panic/crash the API server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Network Validation Bypass] In network_options(), does check_network() properly validate the request.network_identifier against server_context, or can an attacker craft a NetworkRequest with manipulated blockchain/network fields that bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Version Information Leak] Does network_options() expose sensitive version information (ROSETTA_VERSION, NODE_VERSION, middleware_version) that could help attackers identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions for targeted exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Error Enumeration] Does network_options() expose all possible ApiError types via ApiError::all(), allowing attackers to enumerate the complete error space and craft attacks targeting specific error conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Operation Type Leak] Does network_options() leak all supported OperationType values via OperationType::all(), enabling attackers to discover and exploit undocumented or deprecated operation types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Timestamp Start Index] Does network_options() hardcode timestamp_start_index to 2, but could attackers exploit edge cases by requesting blocks 0 or 1 to cause timestamp-related errors or bypass validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Historical Balance Lookup] Does network_options() set historical_balance_lookup to true, but could attackers exploit pruned data scenarios where old blocks are unavailable, causing inconsistent API behavior or crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Call Methods Vector] Does network_options() return an empty call_methods vector, but could attackers send call method requests anyway to discover hidden/undocumented APIs or cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Mempool Coins Flag] Does network_options() set mempool_coins to false, but could attackers still attempt mempool queries that are improperly rejected, leading to information disclosure about transaction pool state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Balance Exemptions] Does network_options() return empty balance_exemptions, but could attackers exploit accounts with special balance rules (like system accounts) that should be exempted but aren't, causing incorrect balance reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Response Serialization] Could attackers send malicious NetworkRequest data that causes the NetworkOptionsResponse serialization to fail or produce corrupted JSON, potentially crashing clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [REST Client Failure] In network_status(), if server_context.rest_client() returns NodeIsOffline error, does the function properly handle this condition, or could repeated offline states cause resource leaks or denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Block Cache Failure] In network_status(), if server_context.block_cache() returns NodeIsOffline error after rest_client succeeded, could this inconsistent state cause incorrect status responses or expose internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Genesis Block Query] Does network_status() query block_cache.get_block_info_by_height(0, chain_id) without validating if genesis block exists, and could corrupted or missing genesis data cause panics or incorrect initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Oldest Block Query] Does network_status() trust state.oldest_block_height from REST API without validation, and could an attacker compromise the REST endpoint to return malicious oldest_block_height causing out-of-bounds block queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Current Block Query] Does network_status() query state.block_height without checking if it's greater than genesis (0), and could edge cases where block_height is 0 cause incorrect current_block_identifier responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Race Condition - Ledger State] Between rest_client.get_ledger_information() and subsequent block_cache queries, could the blockchain state advance, causing inconsistent block identifiers where oldest/current blocks reference different chain states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Race Condition - Block Cache] Could concurrent requests to network_status() access block_cache simultaneously while blocks are being pruned, resulting in inconsistent oldest_block_identifier across responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Timestamp Consistency] Does network_status() ensure current_block.timestamp is consistent with current_block_identifier, or could cached stale timestamps be returned for newly produced blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Sync Status NULL] Does network_status() always return sync_status as None, hiding critical node synchronization issues from clients who may assume the node is fully synced when it's not? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Peers Empty Vector] Does network_status() always return empty peers vector, preventing clients from discovering network topology issues or validator connectivity problems that could affect transaction submission?
