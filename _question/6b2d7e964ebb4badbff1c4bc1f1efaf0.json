  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables or CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR to cause remove_dir_all() at line 11 to delete critical system directories outside the intended documentation path, potentially corrupting the build environment or validator node filesystem? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Symlink Attack] If the documentation path returned by move_stdlib_docs_full_path() is a symlink pointing to a critical system directory, will remove_dir_all() at line 11 follow the symlink and delete unintended files, potentially causing loss of critical blockchain state or configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [TOCTOU Race] Between the remove_dir_all() call at line 11 and the subsequent build_stdlib_doc() call at line 13, can an attacker create a symlink at the documentation path that causes build_stdlib_doc() to write malicious content to an unintended location? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Directory Traversal] Can a malicious Move source file with crafted module names cause build_stdlib_doc() at line 13 to generate documentation with path traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../etc/') that escape the intended output_path directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File Permission] Does build_stdlib_doc() at line 13 create documentation files with overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-writable) that could allow unauthorized modification of documentation used by validators or developers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Suppression] The unwrap_or(()) at line 11 silently ignores errors from remove_dir_all() - can this hide critical filesystem errors (permissions, corrupted filesystem, disk full) that should halt the build process, potentially leading to incomplete or inconsistent builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent executions of main() cause race conditions between remove_dir_all() at line 11 and build_stdlib_doc() at line 13, resulting in corrupted documentation or partial file generation that could mislead developers?

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File Deletion] The remove_file() call at line 22 for the error map file uses unwrap_or(()) - can failure to delete an existing error map result in stale error codes being mixed with new ones, causing incorrect error reporting in the Move VM? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Code Injection] Can malicious Move source code with specially crafted documentation comments inject executable code (JavaScript, HTML) into the generated documentation at line 13, creating XSS vulnerabilities when developers view the docs in browsers? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Documentation Tampering] Can an attacker modify Move source files between build cycles to inject misleading documentation that misrepresents security-critical functions (e.g., documenting a vulnerable function as safe), deceiving auditors relying on documentation generated at line 13? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Template Injection] If build_stdlib_doc() at line 13 uses template files (references.md, overview.md), can malicious content in these templates be injected to generate documentation that misleads developers about security properties of the Move stdlib? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can a malicious Move source file with extremely large documentation comments or deeply nested module structures cause build_stdlib_doc() at line 13 to consume excessive memory/CPU, potentially causing build DoS that prevents validator software updates?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Code Manipulation] Can a malicious contributor inject Move code with crafted error codes that cause build_error_code_map() at line 23 to generate an error map with misleading or swapped error messages, hiding actual security errors from developers and auditors? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Map Corruption] If build_error_code_map() at line 23 fails midway (disk full, interrupted), can it leave a partially written error map that contains incorrect mappings, causing the Move VM to display wrong error messages for critical failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Suppression] The unwrap_or(()) at line 22 ignores errors when removing the old error map - can this hide permission issues or filesystem corruption that would cause build_error_code_map() at line 23 to fail silently, leaving outdated error codes in place?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Non-Atomic Operations] The three separate operations (stdlib docs at line 10, nursery docs at line 16, error map at line 21) are not atomic - can a build interruption leave the codebase in an inconsistent state with partial documentation, misleading developers?
