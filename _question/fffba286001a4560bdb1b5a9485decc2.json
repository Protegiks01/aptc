  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information disclosure] The request_data field uses #[schema(debug)] annotation - can malicious peers trigger logging of sensitive StorageServiceRequest data that exposes internal validator state, transaction details, or network topology to log aggregation systems accessible by attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information disclosure] The error field uses #[schema(debug)] annotation - can Byzantine validators intentionally trigger specific error conditions to leak sensitive information (cryptographic material, internal state, peer identities) through structured error logs that get exported to monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Privacy violation] Does the peer field (#[schema(display)]) expose PeerNetworkId information in logs that could enable network mapping attacks, allowing adversaries to identify validator IP addresses, network topology, or correlation between multiple validator identities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information disclosure] Can the request_id field be correlated across multiple log entries to reconstruct complete transaction flows, enabling timing attacks or revealing patterns in state synchronization that expose validator behavior or consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log injection] The message field accepts arbitrary &str - can malicious peers craft request_type or error messages containing newline characters, ANSI escape codes, or structured log delimiters that inject fake log entries, corrupt log parsing, or trigger vulnerabilities in log aggregation infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log injection] Since request_type uses &str without validation, can attackers supply specially crafted request type strings containing JSON/XML injection payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in downstream log analysis tools, SIEM systems, or monitoring dashboards? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Format string injection] Does the Display implementation for PeerNetworkId properly sanitize output, or can malicious peer IDs containing format string specifiers (%s, %x, etc.) cause crashes or information disclosure when logged through the peer field? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Resource exhaustion] Can Byzantine validators trigger excessive logging by repeatedly sending malformed requests that cause StorageServiceRequest objects (logged via request_data) to be serialized with Debug formatting, potentially exhausting disk space or degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Resource exhaustion] Can malicious peers trigger PeerPollingError or ResponseError events in rapid succession, causing unbounded log growth that fills validator disk storage and leads to service disruption or inability to participate in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Resource exhaustion] If request_data contains large StorageServiceRequest payloads (e.g., requests for massive state ranges), can attackers cause memory exhaustion during Debug serialization of these objects for logging, potentially crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [DoS via logging] Can attackers trigger UnexpectedError events with deeply nested error chains that consume excessive CPU during Debug formatting, degrading validator performance and affecting consensus participation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Sensitive data exposure] Does the StorageServiceRequest type (logged via request_data) contain account addresses, transaction hashes, or state keys that violate user privacy when logged at trace level and exported to centralized monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Credential leakage] If Error types contain connection strings, authentication tokens, or cryptographic material in their debug representations, can the error field inadvertently log these secrets when Byzantine peers trigger specific error conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [PII exposure] Can the combination of peer, request_id, and request_data fields be used to deanonymize validators or track specific user transactions across the network, violating privacy expectations and enabling targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Serialization vulnerability] The LogEntry enum uses #[serde(rename_all = 'snake_case')] - can malicious log consumers exploit differences between serialized names and actual enum variants to bypass log filtering or security policies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Serialization vulnerability] Does the serde serialization of LogEvent properly handle all 16 variants without ambiguity, or can attackers craft logs that deserialize into unexpected event types, bypassing monitoring alerts or security rules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Derive: Schema] [Type confusion] Can the #[derive(Schema)] macro generate code with type confusion vulnerabilities where LogSchema fields are misinterpreted during serialization, leading to incorrect security decisions based on log analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::AggregateSummary] [State sync manipulation] Can Byzantine validators manipulate the conditions that trigger AggregateSummary log events to hide evidence of state synchronization attacks or consensus violations from monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::CaughtUpToLatest] [False positive] Can malicious peers cause spurious CaughtUpToLatest events to be logged when the validator is actually behind, masking synchronization failures that could lead to state inconsistencies or consensus safety violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::NoPeersToPoll] [Network partition] If NoPeersToPoll events are not properly monitored, can Byzantine validators isolate honest nodes by refusing connections while suppressing detection through manipulated logging patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::PeerIgnored] [Censorship attack] Can malicious validators cause legitimate peers to be ignored by triggering conditions that generate PeerIgnored events, enabling targeted censorship or network partition attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::PeerNoLongerIgnored] [State confusion] Can race conditions between PeerIgnored and PeerNoLongerIgnored events create inconsistent peer state that allows Byzantine validators to participate in consensus while appearing to be ignored in logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::ResponseError] [Monitoring bypass] Can Byzantine validators suppress ResponseError events by manipulating error handling paths, preventing detection of consensus attacks, double-spending attempts, or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::StorageReadFailed] [Data corruption hiding] If StorageReadFailed events are not consistently logged, can attackers corrupt state data without triggering alerts, leading to undetected Merkle tree inconsistencies or state divergence?
