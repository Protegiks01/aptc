  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Non-exhaustive match] If a new variant is added to PeerMonitoringServiceRequest but get_label() uses a wildcard pattern, can this cause incorrect label assignment or runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Missing variant handling] Are all handlers (server-side processing) exhaustively matching all enum variants, or can missing cases cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Malicious validator] Can a Byzantine validator (<1/3 threshold) exploit the peer monitoring service to gather intelligence on honest validators before launching consensus attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNodeInformation] [Sync status leak] Can Byzantine nodes use GetNodeInformation to identify validators that are out of sync, then target them with conflicting blocks to cause consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Unbounded counter] Is there any validation that ping_counter stays within reasonable bounds (e.g., < 2^32), or can attackers send requests with astronomically large counters causing integer overflow in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Variant size imbalance] Do all enum variants have similar serialized sizes, or can attackers exploit variants with significantly larger size to cause disproportionate bandwidth/memory consumption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Non-idempotent requests] Are all request types idempotent, or can repeated processing of the same request (e.g., due to network retries) cause incorrect state updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Duplicate handling] If a LatencyPing request with the same ping_counter is received twice (due to network duplication), can this corrupt latency measurements or request tracking state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Network isolation bypass] Can requests from mainnet peers be processed by testnet nodes (or vice versa), allowing cross-network information leakage or attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Multi-network confusion] If a node participates in multiple networks simultaneously, can request handling logic incorrectly mix state between networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Missing integrity check] Does each request include a cryptographic signature or MAC to prevent tampering, or can attackers modify requests in transit without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Replay protection] Is there any cryptographic nonce or timestamp in addition to ping_counter to prevent replay attacks, or is ping_counter alone sufficient? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Invalid state transition] Can peers send requests in invalid sequences (e.g., GetNodeInformation before GetServerProtocolVersion) that violate expected state machine transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Counter state corruption] If ping_counter tracking state is corrupted (e.g., due to storage failure), can this permanently break latency monitoring for that peer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNetworkInformation] [Response size attack] Can an attacker with many connections cause GetNetworkInformation responses to become extremely large (megabytes), exhausting bandwidth and memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNodeInformation] [Build info leak] Does GetNodeInformation response include full build information with git commit hashes, allowing attackers to precisely identify vulnerable code versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Latency spoofing] Can malicious peers selectively respond faster to LatencyPing requests while delaying other traffic, causing honest nodes to prefer them as peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNetworkInformation] [Distance manipulation] Can attackers lie about their distance_from_validators in responses to appear closer to consensus nodes than they actually are? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Request complexity] Are all request types equally expensive to process, or can attackers selectively send the most expensive requests to maximize resource consumption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Ping storm] Can an attacker coordinate multiple malicious peers to simultaneously send LatencyPing floods to a target validator, overwhelming its request processing capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Future variant handling] When new request variants are added in protocol upgrades, can older nodes safely ignore unknown variants or will deserialization fail causing network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Field extension] If new fields are added to LatencyPingRequest, will this break backward compatibility with older peers that send requests without those fields? (Medium)"
