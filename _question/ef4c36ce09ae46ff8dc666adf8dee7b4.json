  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Determinism Violation] Are all error code constants at lines 117-153 guaranteed to be identical across all validators? Could compiler or platform differences cause error code divergence and consensus breaks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Cross-Module Usage] [Error Handling Inconsistency] Since this error module is used throughout aptos-vm, block-executor, and framework code, can inconsistent error handling across modules cause security gaps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Code Constants] [Numeric Collision] Do the error code constants at lines 117-153 overlap with any Move VM reserved codes or system status codes? Could collision cause critical errors to be mishandled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: canonical()] [Bit Shift Edge Case] At line 157, if category is greater than 0xFF, the left shift by 16 bits can produce codes that overlap with other categories. Is input validation missing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: canonical()] [Reason Code Bounds] Can reason codes at line 157 exceed 16 bits (>0xFFFF)? Would this cause incorrect error codes due to bit overflow into the category field? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Message Length] [Unbounded Strings] At lines 26-29, is there a maximum length for error messages? Could unbounded messages cause memory exhaustion or log overflow? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [HTTP Status Mapping] [REST API Confusion] At lines 116-153, error codes are mapped to HTTP status codes. Can an attacker exploit semantic differences between internal VM errors and HTTP responses to bypass API security checks? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Code Stability] [Breaking Changes] If error code constants at lines 117-153 are changed in protocol upgrades, could old and new nodes disagree on error classification, breaking consensus during epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [StatusCode Evolution] [Version Incompatibility] Can changes to DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR handling between versions cause divergent behavior when old and new validators process the same transactions? (Critical)",
