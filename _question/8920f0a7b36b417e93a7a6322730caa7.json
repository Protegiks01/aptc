  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Re-verification safety] If a module is verified multiple times (e.g., during upgrades), could cached state from previous verifications affect results? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: verify_module()] [Self module ID] The error uses module.self_id() - could a malicious module spoof its own ID to appear as a trusted module? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Intra-module references] All checks assume structs reference others within the same module - is this assumption enforced, or could inter-module references be injected? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_struct_defs()] [Struct definition validity] Does struct_def_at return validated data, or could corrupted struct definitions with invalid handles/fields be processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Empty struct handling] Structs with no fields create nodes with no outgoing edges - is this handled correctly in all graph algorithms? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Struct field ordering] Does the order in which fields are processed affect cycle detection, or is the algorithm order-independent? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [BTreeMap determinism] BTreeMap uses Ord for ordering - are StructHandleIndex and StructDefinitionIndex Ord implementations deterministic across all platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: build()] [BTreeSet deduplication] BTreeSet automatically deduplicates edges - could this hide important information about multiple paths to recursion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [BTreeMap memory overhead] For large modules, could BTreeMap memory overhead become excessive compared to HashMap? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [A->B->C->A cycles] Does the toposort algorithm correctly detect indirect cycles through multiple structs, not just direct self-references? (High)",
