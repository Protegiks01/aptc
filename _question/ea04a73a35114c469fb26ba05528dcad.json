  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: next_impl()] [Dirty reads] Can the iterator read uncommitted data from ongoing transactions, potentially exposing intermediate state that should never be visible to validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Struct: SchemaIterator] [Iterator cloning] If SchemaIterator is cloned (implicitly or explicitly), do both iterators share the same underlying db_iter, potentially causing one iterator's operations to affect the other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: next_impl()] [Determinism] Does the iteration order guarantee deterministic results across all validator nodes, or can RocksDB internal state differences cause validators to see different key orderings? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Struct: SchemaIterator] [Snapshot lifetime] Does the iterator hold a RocksDB snapshot for its entire lifetime, and can long-lived iterators prevent state pruning, causing storage bloat on validator nodes? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Struct: SchemaIterator] [PhantomData variance] At line 30, does the PhantomData<S> field properly constrain variance of the Schema type parameter, or can it be unsafely coerced to different schemas? (Medium)",
