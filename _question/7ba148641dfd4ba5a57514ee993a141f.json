  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 8-22] [Clone safety] Do the Clone derives on Command, RootArgs, and inner types guarantee deep copies, or could shared references lead to use-after-free or data races when commands are cloned and passed to async contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 8-22] [Debug trait exploit] Can the Debug derives on Command and RootArgs be exploited to cause excessive memory allocation or infinite recursion if malicious input creates deeply nested or circular structures?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 24-38] [Tokio executor] Does the tokio::main macro's default single-threaded executor prevent race conditions in the delegated run_cmd functions, or could multi-threaded tokio configurations introduce data races in shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 28-30] [Logger initialization race] Could concurrent execution of multiple node-checker instances cause race conditions in global logger initialization, leading to log corruption or initialization failures? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 5] [Library trust] Is aptos_node_checker_lib properly audited and trustworthy, or could a compromised or vulnerable library implementation exploit the trust boundary when invoked from this binary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 6] [Clap parser CVE] Does the clap version used have any known CVEs related to argument parsing, command injection, or buffer overflows that could be exploited through crafted command-line input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege escalation] Does the binary run with appropriate minimal privileges, or could it be exploited to escalate privileges if invoked by a lower-privileged user through SUID bits or capability inheritance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 24-38] [Process isolation] If the node checker is compromised, is it properly isolated from the validator node process, or could it access validator keys, consensus state, or other critical resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 34-35] [Network exposure] When server::run_cmd() is invoked, does it bind to localhost only or expose the checker API to the public network, potentially allowing unauthorized health check queries or attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 26] [Environment variable injection] Can environment variables be manipulated to influence RootArgs::parse() behavior, bypassing intended command restrictions or injecting malicious configuration? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Lines 24-38] [Signal handling] Does the binary handle SIGTERM, SIGINT, and other signals gracefully during async execution, or could improper signal handling leave the checker or monitored nodes in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/bin/aptos-node-checker.rs] [Function: main()] [Process termination] When main() returns an Err, does the process exit with appropriate error codes that monitoring systems can detect, or could failures go unnoticed allowing unhealthy nodes to remain in validator set?
