  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_bytecode_verifier()] [Verification loop] Lines 641-672 iterate through all units verifying each - can the verifier skip units or verify them multiple times due to iterator bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_bytecode_verifier()] [Module vs script] Lines 644-669 handle modules and scripts differently - can attackers craft hybrid units that exploit differences in verification logic? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_bytecode_verifier()] [Error aggregation] Lines 654 and 667 set errors=true but verification continues - can multiple verification errors compound into more severe vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_bytecode_verifier()] [Return value inversion] Line 672 returns !errors - can boolean logic bugs here cause verification failures to be treated as successes? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: report_bytecode_verification_error()] [Location fallback] Lines 681-685 fall back to module_ir_loc if precise location unavailable - can imprecise error locations hide the true source of verification failures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: report_bytecode_verification_error()] [Status type check] Lines 686-695 check if error is Verification status - can non-verification errors bypass proper error handling and be silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: report_bytecode_verification_error()] [Debug message format] Lines 697-704 conditionally include debug info based on env var - can backtrace info leak sensitive internals? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: report_bytecode_verification_error()] [Bug severity] Lines 688 and 705 report verification failures as Severity::Bug - can reporting as bugs instead of errors allow invalid bytecode to be deployed in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: report_bytecode_verification_error()] [Compiler bug messaging] Lines 694 and 713 add COMPILER_BUG_REPORT_MSG to diagnostics - can this message manipulation confuse operators about whether the issue is in user code or compiler? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_vm_error_loc()] [Offset mapping] Lines 720-725 map VM error offsets to source locations - can offset calculation bugs cause errors to be attributed to wrong source lines, hiding vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_errors()] [Severity handling] Lines 733-736 use options.report_severity() to determine which errors to report - can severity threshold manipulation cause critical errors to be ignored? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_errors()] [Options default] Line 733 uses unwrap_or_default() for missing options - can missing options cause incorrect error handling behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_errors()] [Dual checking] Lines 735-736 call both report_diag and check_diag - can inconsistencies between these two checks cause errors to be reported but not properly checked? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: annotate_units()] [Location copying] Lines 745 and 755 copy definition_location to annotated units - can location bugs cause misattribution of code to wrong files? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: annotate_units()] [Address name none] Line 749 sets address_name to None - can missing address names break address resolution in downstream tools? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: annotate_units()] [Spec info default] Line 758 uses Default::default() for spec_info - can missing spec info cause formal verification to be skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: make_files_source_text()] [Hash collision] Lines 770-776 use file hashes as keys - can hash collisions cause different files to overwrite each other in the mapping? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: make_files_source_text()] [Missing hashes] Line 771 only inserts files with hashes - can files without hashes be silently skipped, losing critical source mapping? (Low)",
