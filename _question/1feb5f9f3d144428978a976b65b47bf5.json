  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Error information leakage] Do error messages or error types returned from this function leak sensitive information about validator internal state or memory layout that attackers could exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Type parameter mismatch] The `_ty_args` parameter is ignored - can Move code provide type arguments that don't match the actual runtime types of the compared values, causing type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Generic type instantiation] Can the function be instantiated with type parameters containing references, resources, or capabilities that should not be comparable, bypassing Move's type system safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Resource value comparison] Does comparing resource values (Move's linear types) violate resource safety by allowing implicit copying or observing resource contents without consuming them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Signer value comparison] Can signer values be compared, and if so, does this expose information about transaction senders or break the abstraction of signer capabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Capability comparison] Can Move capability objects be compared, potentially allowing capability forgery or unauthorized access if comparison reveals internal capability structure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Reference counting issues] When comparing values containing references, are reference counts properly maintained, or can comparison cause reference count overflows/underflows leading to use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Borrow checker bypass] Can the native function access or compare borrowed values in ways that would be forbidden by Move's borrow checker, potentially causing memory safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Move value ownership] After comparison, are both input values properly returned to Move code with correct ownership semantics, or can comparison consume or leak values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Gas parameter version skew] If validators are running different gas schedule versions, can CMP_COMPARE_BASE or CMP_COMPARE_PER_ABS_VAL_UNIT differ across nodes, causing some validators to accept transactions that others reject? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Gas schedule upgrade safety] During gas schedule upgrades, can in-flight transactions executing comparison operations charge gas using old parameters while new transactions use new parameters, causing state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Zero gas parameter attack] Can gas parameters be set to zero through governance, and if so, does this enable unlimited free comparisons causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Gas parameter integer overflow] Can extremely large gas parameter values cause overflow when multiplied with value sizes, wrapping to small values and enabling undercharged operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Abstract value size consistency] Is AbstractValueSize calculated consistently across all validators regardless of their internal representation of values, or can size calculations diverge? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Reference dereferencing depth] How many levels of reference indirection does `abs_val_size_dereferenced()` follow before calculating size, and can deeply nested references cause stack overflow or excessive computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Circular reference size] If values contain circular references, does `abs_val_size_dereferenced()` detect cycles and return an error, or can it loop infinitely or return incorrect sizes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Size calculation overflow] Can the abstract size calculation overflow for extremely large or deeply nested values, causing it to wrap to a small value and dramatically undercharge gas? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Shared reference size counting] When multiple references point to the same underlying value, does size calculation count the value once or multiple times, and can this be exploited to manipulate gas charges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [Lazy value size] For values with delayed computation or lazy fields, does size calculation force evaluation before sizing, potentially causing expensive operations before gas is charged? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/cmp.rs] [Function: native_compare()] [SmallVec allocation] The return value uses SmallVec at line 61 - can the inline storage be insufficient causing heap allocation, and does this allocation count against gas/memory limits? (Low)",
