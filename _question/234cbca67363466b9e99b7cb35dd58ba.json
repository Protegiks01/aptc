  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Concurrency: All Functions] [Thread Safety] Are the AptosError and Response types thread-safe when modified during error conversion, or can concurrent error handling from multiple API requests cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Resources: convert_error()] [Response Memory Leak] Does the take_body() operation at line 31 properly deallocate the original response body, or can repeated error conversions leak memory eventually causing validator OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Resources: panic_handler()] [Stack Exhaustion] Can deeply nested panics or recursive panic scenarios exhaust the stack before panic_handler catches them, causing validator process crashes and loss of liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Resources: All] [Connection Leaks] If errors occur during response generation, are HTTP connections properly closed or can error handling paths leave connections in half-open states exhausting validator connection pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Codes] [Missing VM Error Codes] When VM execution errors should include vm_error_code fields for proper gas accounting, does the generic error conversion lose these codes causing incorrect gas refunds and economic exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Codes] [Error Code Exhaustion] Are there sufficient error codes (24 defined codes in AptosErrorCode enum) to represent all possible framework and panic scenarios, or can critical error types be misclassified as generic InternalError/WebFrameworkError? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Codes] [Code Semantic Confusion] Can clients rely on error codes for security decisions (e.g., retry logic, transaction resubmission) when framework errors are all mapped to WebFrameworkError code 601 regardless of their true nature? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Logging: panic_handler()] [Log Flooding] Can attackers deliberately trigger panics to flood error logs at line 50, causing log storage exhaustion, log rotation issues, or overwhelming log aggregation systems monitoring validator health? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Logging: panic_handler()] [Log Tampering] Are error logs written atomically and with integrity protection, or can an attacker triggering panics then manipulate log files to hide their attacks from security monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Monitoring: All] [Alert Fatigue] If legitimate errors are misclassified as InternalError or WebFrameworkError due to generic error conversion, can this cause alert fatigue where security teams ignore genuine attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [HTTP: convert_error()] [Status Code Mismatch] When error.into_response() at line 29 creates a response with one HTTP status code, but the error conversion replaces the body with different semantics, can this confuse HTTP intermediaries (proxies, load balancers, CDNs)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [HTTP: convert_error()] [Header Preservation] Does response.headers_mut() at line 33 preserve security-critical headers from the original framework error (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options) or are they lost during conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [HTTP: All] [HTTP Smuggling] Can error responses with manipulated headers or bodies enable HTTP request smuggling attacks if they interact improperly with upstream proxies or load balancers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Edge Case: convert_error()] [Empty Error String] What happens if error.to_string() at line 25 returns an empty string - does build_error_response create a valid error response or can this cause JSON serialization failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Edge Case: convert_error()] [Null Bytes in Errors] Can error strings containing null bytes or invalid UTF-8 sequences cause JSON serialization failures, log corruption, or string truncation vulnerabilities in downstream systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Edge Case: panic_handler()] [Panic During Panic] If panic_handler itself panics (e.g., logging system failure, JSON serialization panic), does Rust's double-panic abort mechanism terminate the validator process causing loss of liveness? (High)"
