  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [All Functions] [Error Propagation] Do error returns properly clean up partial state changes, or can failed operations leave sessions in corrupted intermediate states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [All Functions] [Panic Safety] Can panic in any command (e.g., unwrap(), expect()) leave sessions in inconsistent state without proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [All Functions] [Debug Information] Do Debug implementations for command structs leak sensitive information (API keys, private paths) in logs or error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Session Initialization Race] Can multiple processes simultaneously call Session::init() or Session::init_with_remote_state() on the same path, causing file corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Session Mutation Race] If Session is not thread-safe, can concurrent fund_account() calls on the same session cause lost updates or corrupted balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Session Read Race] Can viewing resources while another process modifies the session cause reading partially written data or corrupted JSON? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [All Commands] [File Locking] Do session operations use proper file locking to prevent concurrent access issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [State Replay] Can an attacker fork from an old network_version and replay historical transactions to find vulnerabilities that existed in past protocol versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Balance Replay] Can an attacker create a session, fund accounts, copy session files, then reload them multiple times to simulate different scenarios with same initial funding? (Low)"
