  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Simulation: Determinism] Are simulation results deterministic when the same human-readable StateKeys are used across different nodes or at different times? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Simulation: Rollback] If a simulation fails after parsing StateKeys, are all state changes properly rolled back, or can partial state be committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Components] Can StateKey strings with empty components between '::' delimiters (e.g., 'code::0x1::') parse successfully but create invalid state keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Edge Case: Whitespace] Does the parser trim whitespace from components, or can leading/trailing spaces cause StateKeys to be treated as different despite representing the same logical key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Edge Case: Case Sensitivity] Are module names, addresses, and hex strings case-sensitive, and can case differences be exploited to create duplicate StateKeys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Edge Case: Numeric Overflow] Can extremely large AccountAddress values (e.g., > 2^256) be parsed without overflow when converting from string to integer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/state_store.rs] [Edge Case: Comment Injection] Can comment-like syntax (e.g., '//', '/*') in StateKey strings be interpreted in unintended ways during parsing? (Low)"
