  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Concurrent Burns] If multiple transactions burn the same TokenId concurrently, are the events serialized correctly or can they interleave causing supply calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Event Processing Race] Can burn events be processed in a different order than they were emitted, causing temporal inconsistencies in supply tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Parallel Execution] In Aptos's parallel execution model (Block-STM), can concurrent burns of different tokens cause event ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [VM Type Checking] Does the Move VM properly validate that BurnTokenEvent matches the expected type signature, or can type-confused events pass through? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Gas Metering] Is the gas cost of emitting a BurnTokenEvent properly metered to prevent spam, or can attackers flood the event log cheaply? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Resource Safety] Does the Move resource model prevent BurnTokenEvent from being copied or dropped improperly, which could duplicate or lose burn records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Bytecode Injection] Can malicious Move bytecode create BurnTokenEvent instances without going through the proper token module functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic Safety] Does try_from_bytes() handle all deserialization errors gracefully without panicking, which could crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Empty String Fields] If TokenId contains empty collection or name strings, does this cause issues in event processing or indexing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Unicode Handling] Can TokenId fields contain malicious Unicode (like right-to-left override) that causes display issues in indexers or wallets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Max Field Sizes] Are there limits on TokenId string field sizes to prevent memory exhaustion attacks through extremely long collection/name values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Emission Authorization] Who can emit BurnTokenEvent - only the token module, or can arbitrary contracts emit these events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Creator Verification] Does the event validate that the burner has authority over the TokenId, or can anyone emit burn events for any token? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [System Account Protection] Can burn events be emitted claiming to burn tokens from system accounts (0x1, 0x3, etc.)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Transaction Revert] If a transaction containing a burn event reverts, is the event properly rolled back or does it persist causing ghost burns? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Block Reorg] During chain reorganizations, can burn events be replayed or duplicated causing incorrect supply tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Timestamp Manipulation] Does the event include timestamp information, and if not, can temporal ordering attacks exploit this? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Sequence Number] Are burn events sequenced per TokenId, or can they be processed out of order causing state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Token Standard Compliance] Does BurnTokenEvent conform to the Aptos token standard (0x3::token), or can non-standard tokens emit compatible events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Fungible vs NFT] Does the event properly distinguish between burning fungible tokens (amount > 1 valid) vs NFTs (only amount = 1 valid)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Royalty Bypass] Can burning tokens bypass royalty payments that should be triggered on transfer, causing creator revenue loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Collection Integrity] If all tokens in a collection are burned, does this properly update collection-level metadata and supply counters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Event Signature] Are burn events cryptographically signed to prove authenticity, or can unsigned events be injected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Hash Collision] If events are indexed by hash, can hash collisions cause different burn events to be treated as duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Event Pruning] If old events are pruned from storage, can this break supply calculations that rely on historical burn data? (Medium)"
