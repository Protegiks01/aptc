  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: old_authentication_key()] [Mutable access] Since this returns &Vec<u8>, could unsafe code or FFI boundaries allow modification of the supposedly immutable old key, corrupting event integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: new_authentication_key()] [Data lifetime issues] Can the returned reference outlive the KeyRotation struct in async contexts, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: old_authentication_key()] [Side channel] Does returning references to authentication keys enable timing attacks where an attacker can measure key comparison operations to extract key information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: new_authentication_key()] [Memory safety] If the Vec<u8> contains sensitive key material, is it properly zeroized after use, or does it remain in memory where it could be extracted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event ordering attack] Can an attacker emit KeyRotation events out of order relative to actual account state changes, causing indexers or wallets to process rotations incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Duplicate event emission] Since the struct implements drop, can multiple identical KeyRotation events be emitted for a single rotation, confusing event consumers and recovery tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event/state inconsistency] Can a transaction emit a KeyRotation event but fail to update the actual Account resource, creating a mismatch between events and on-chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event replay across chains] Does the event contain chain-specific information to prevent replaying KeyRotation events from testnet to mainnet or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Transaction rollback] If a transaction that emits a KeyRotation event is aborted or rolled back, are the events properly cleaned up, or do they persist causing phantom rotations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Parallel execution race] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent transactions emit conflicting KeyRotation events for the same account that violate rotation sequence guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event version migration] During the migration from legacy KeyRotationEvent to module-level KeyRotation, can events be lost or duplicated causing recovery failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [BCS encoding determinism] Is the BCS serialization of KeyRotation deterministic across different Rust compiler versions and platforms, or could non-determinism cause state divergence between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Storage amplification] Can an attacker create KeyRotation events with large authentication keys that cause storage amplification attacks, forcing validators to store excessive event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event pruning bypass] Are KeyRotation events subject to pruning, or do they persist forever in the event store, enabling long-term storage exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Merkle tree corruption] Do KeyRotation events contribute to state root calculations, and could malformed events corrupt the Jellyfish Merkle tree? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event indexing DoS] Can an attacker flood the network with valid but unnecessary KeyRotation events that overwhelm event indexers and APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [OriginatingAddress manipulation] Can an attacker craft KeyRotation events with new_authentication_key values that collide with or corrupt entries in the OriginatingAddress mapping, enabling wallet recovery hijacking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Account resource bypass] Can the KeyRotation event be emitted without corresponding changes to the Account resource's authentication_key field, breaking the consistency between events and state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Rotation capability abuse] Can an attacker with a delegated RotationCapability emit KeyRotation events for accounts they don't control by exploiting mismatches between event account field and actual authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Multi-sig account confusion] For multi-signature accounts, can KeyRotation events be emitted that don't reflect the actual multi-key configuration, confusing recovery tools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Friend module exploitation] Can friend modules (aptos_account, multisig_account, etc.) abuse their access to emit unauthorized KeyRotation events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Resource account confusion] Can KeyRotation events for resource accounts be exploited to create fake rotation histories since resource accounts have different ownership models? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key derivation bypass] Since the event stores raw authentication key bytes, can an attacker provide keys that don't follow proper derivation from public keys, breaking the cryptographic chain of trust? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Hash collision exploitation] Can an attacker find authentication key collisions (SHA3-256 collisions) to rotate to keys that map to multiple different public keys, enabling account takeover? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key scheme confusion] Does the KeyRotation event validate that authentication keys match supported schemes (Ed25519, MultiEd25519, SingleKey, MultiKey), or can unsupported schemes be used? (High)"
