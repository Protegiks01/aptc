  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Struct: DataSummaryPoller] [Concurrent Access] Can multiple threads concurrently modify the in_flight_priority_polls and in_flight_regular_polls DashSets leading to race conditions that allow duplicate polling of the same peer, potentially causing state synchronization inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does the constructor properly validate that the data_client_config contains safe values for max_num_in_flight_priority_polls and max_num_in_flight_regular_polls, or can malicious configuration lead to resource exhaustion by allowing unbounded concurrent polls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Struct: DataSummaryPoller] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker manipulate the DashSet data structures by causing memory exhaustion through adding peers to in_flight_priority_polls and in_flight_regular_polls without proper bounds checking, leading to validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Struct: DataSummaryPoller] [State Corruption] Are the Arc-wrapped in_flight_priority_polls and in_flight_regular_polls properly synchronized when accessed from multiple async tasks, or can concurrent modifications lead to inconsistent views of in-flight poll state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: identify_peers_to_poll()] [Logic Error] Can the poll_priority_peers boolean be manipulated through external timing attacks to always poll priority peers, starving regular peers and causing state synchronization failures for non-priority network participants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: identify_peers_to_poll()] [Error Handling] Does the function properly handle errors from get_priority_and_regular_peers(), or can a failure in peer classification lead to silent continuation with empty peer sets, causing synchronization stalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: identify_peers_to_poll()] [Peer Classification] Can malicious peers exploit the priority/regular peer classification by rapidly changing their priority status to evade polling or receive preferential treatment, manipulating state synchronization order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: identify_peers_to_poll()] [Return Value] Are empty HashSets properly handled by callers when no peers are available to poll, or can this lead to infinite loops or stuck synchronization states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_priority_peers_to_poll()] [Integer Overflow] Can the calculation at line 111 (max_num_in_flight_polls.saturating_sub(num_in_flight_polls)) be exploited if num_in_flight_polls is manipulated to be greater than max_num_in_flight_polls, causing incorrect peer selection?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_priority_peers_to_poll()] [Metrics Manipulation] Can the update_in_flight_metrics call at line 101 be exploited to provide false metrics that mislead operators about system health while attackers manipulate peer selection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_priority_peers_to_poll()] [Early Return] Does returning an empty hashset at line 107 when max in-flight polls is reached properly signal to the caller that no polling should occur, or can this be misinterpreted as successful peer selection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_priority_peers_to_poll()] [Configuration Attack] Can malicious configuration set max_num_in_flight_priority_polls to 0, causing priority peers to never be polled and breaking state synchronization for critical validator nodes? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_regular_peers_to_poll()] [Symmetry Attack] Since this function mirrors get_priority_peers_to_poll, can an attacker exploit differences in how priority vs regular peers are handled to cause state synchronization divergence across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: get_regular_peers_to_poll()] [Race Condition] Similar to priority peers, can the time gap between checking num_in_flight_polls at line 129 and initiating polls lead to exceeding max_num_in_flight_regular_polls? (High)",
