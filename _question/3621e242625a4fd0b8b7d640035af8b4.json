  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: LedgerCommitProgress] [Double-spend] Can manipulating LedgerCommitProgress to revert to an earlier version cause validators to accept duplicate transactions that were already committed, enabling double-spending attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateKvCommitProgress] [State inconsistency] If StateKvCommitProgress diverges from StateMerkleCommitProgress, can queries return state values that don't match the committed Merkle root, breaking state verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateKvShardCommitProgress(ShardId)] [Shard commit inconsistency] Can advancing commit progress for some shards while holding back others cause partial state commits where cross-shard transactions appear half-executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateMerkleCommitProgress] [Merkle root mismatch] If StateMerkleCommitProgress is updated without corresponding state KV updates, can the committed Merkle root fail to match actual stored state, breaking consensus verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateMerkleShardCommitProgress(ShardId)] [Proof generation failure] Can inconsistent StateMerkleShardCommitProgress across shards cause Merkle proof generation to fail for some keys while succeeding for others, breaking client queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: LedgerCommitProgress] [Truncation attack] During database truncation operations, if LedgerCommitProgress is not atomically updated with actual data truncation, can this leave the database in an irrecoverable corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateSnapshotKvRestoreProgress(Version)] [Restore corruption] Can an attacker manipulating StateSnapshotKvRestoreProgress cause state snapshot restoration to skip critical state chunks, resulting in incomplete state that breaks validator operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateMerkleShardRestoreProgress(ShardId, Version)] [Shard restore attack] If StateMerkleShardRestoreProgress is advanced prematurely for some shards, can this cause partial Merkle tree restoration where some shards are incomplete, breaking state proof verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Value: StateSnapshotProgress] [Progress tracking bypass] Can an attacker write malicious StateSnapshotProgress with manipulated key_hash values to cause restoration to incorrectly skip or re-process chunks, leading to state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateSnapshotKvRestoreProgress(Version)] [Version mismatch] If multiple restore operations for different versions are concurrent, can progress tracking for one version interfere with another, causing data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: Version] [Integer overflow] Since Version is u64, can setting progress values to u64::MAX cause arithmetic overflow in pruner calculations that use progress + offset, leading to wraparound and data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: ShardId] [Invalid shard ID] Since ShardId is usize, can writing metadata with shard IDs exceeding NUM_STATE_SHARDS cause out-of-bounds access or undefined behavior when shard arrays are indexed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateKvShardCommitProgress(ShardId)] [Shard ID validation] Is there validation preventing ShardId from being usize::MAX or other extreme values that could cause memory allocation failures or integer overflow in shard-related calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Value: Version(Version)] [Zero version] Can setting commit or pruner progress to Version(0) cause special case handling bugs in code that assumes progress is always positive, potentially triggering unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateMerkleShardRestoreProgress(ShardId, Version)] [Parameter validation] Are both ShardId and Version parameters validated for reasonable ranges, or can extreme values cause downstream calculation overflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [Race condition] Can concurrent updates to the same DbMetadataKey from pruner threads and commit threads cause lost updates where progress tracking becomes inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: OverallCommitProgress] [TOCTOU] Can a time-of-check-time-of-use race exist where OverallCommitProgress is read, validated, then updated by another thread before the original thread writes, causing progress to move backward? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateKvShardCommitProgress(ShardId)] [Cross-shard race] Can concurrent commits to different shards cause race conditions where StateKvShardCommitProgress updates are reordered, breaking the invariant that overall progress reflects all shard progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Value: DbMetadataValue] [Torn read] Can reading DbMetadataValue while it's being concurrently updated cause partial/torn reads of the BCS-encoded value, leading to deserialization errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [Atomic update] Are metadata updates guaranteed to be atomic at the RocksDB level, or can crashes during write cause partially-written metadata that corrupts progress tracking on restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [No access control] Since there's no access control validation in encode/decode functions, can any code with database access arbitrarily modify critical metadata like LedgerCommitProgress, enabling privilege escalation?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [Isolation violation] Is metadata stored in a separate column family with proper isolation, or can bugs in other schema handlers accidentally overwrite metadata entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Error suppression] Does the ? operator in encode_key() properly propagate BCS serialization errors, or can error handling bugs cause silent failures where invalid keys are written to the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Error context loss] When decode_value() returns an error via ?, is sufficient context preserved to debug which specific metadata key had corrupted data, or are errors too generic? (Low)"
