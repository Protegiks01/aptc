  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Missing timestamps] Without a timestamp field, how can auditors determine the exact time of collection creation for regulatory compliance or dispute resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [No transaction hash] The event doesn't reference its originating transaction hash - can this make it impossible to trace collection provenance or verify authenticity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error attribution] When deserialization fails, how is the faulty event traced back to its emitting transaction for slashing or blacklisting malicious actors? (Low)",
