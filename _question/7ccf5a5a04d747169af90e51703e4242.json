  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: contains_range()] [Early termination exploitation] Does the early 'break' when item_exists=true allow attackers to craft ranges where initial items exist but later items don't, causing the function to incorrectly return true for incomplete ranges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: contains_range()] [Empty advertised_ranges handling] When advertised_ranges is empty, contains_range() immediately returns false for any range. Can this be exploited during network partitions or startup to incorrectly reject valid synchronization requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_epoch_ending_ledger_info()] [Malicious epoch manipulation] Can Byzantine validators advertise artificially inflated epoch numbers (e.g., Epoch::MAX) to make honest nodes believe the network has progressed far beyond reality, causing them to reject legitimate proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_epoch_ending_ledger_info()] [Empty range handling] When epoch_ending_ledger_infos is empty, the function returns None. Can this cause synchronization logic to fail or make incorrect decisions during network startup or after data pruning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_epoch_ending_ledger_info()] [Integer overflow in max()] Does the max() operation on Epoch values handle potential overflow if malicious peers advertise Epoch values near u64::MAX, or can this cause panic or wrapping behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_epoch_ending_ledger_info()] [Inconsistent highest values] If multiple ranges have the same highest epoch, does the selection of which range is arbitrary, and can this be exploited to prefer malicious peers' data over honest peers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_epoch_ending_ledger_info()] [Concurrent modification] If epoch_ending_ledger_infos Vec is being modified concurrently, can the iterator produce inconsistent results leading to incorrect highest epoch detection or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [Version manipulation] Can malicious peers advertise LedgerInfoWithSignatures with artificially high version numbers to be selected as the highest, then fail to provide the actual data, blocking synchronization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [Clone performance] The function clones the entire LedgerInfoWithSignatures structure which may contain large signature sets. Can this be exploited to cause excessive memory allocation or CPU usage when called frequently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [Empty vector handling] When synced_ledger_infos is empty, returns None. Can this cause null pointer dereferences or unwrap() panics in calling code that doesn't properly handle the Option type? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [position_max() ambiguity] If multiple ledger infos have the same version (which should be impossible but isn't validated), does position_max() return a deterministic position, or can different nodes select different ledger infos causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [Out of bounds access] The function uses get() which is safe, but can the highest_synced_position be out of bounds due to concurrent Vec modification between position_max() and get() calls, causing None to be returned incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [Signature verification assumption] Does the function assume all LedgerInfoWithSignatures in the vector have already been cryptographically verified, or can unverified signatures be selected and used for critical synchronization decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: highest_synced_ledger_info()] [ledger_info().version() call safety] Does the nested access pattern (ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info().version()) handle all variants of LedgerInfoWithSignatures::V0 correctly, or can future variants cause match errors or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_state_version()] [Pruning attack] Can malicious nodes advertise artificially low state versions (e.g., version 0) to make honest nodes believe very old state data is available, wasting resources attempting to sync from non-existent historical state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_state_version()] [Delegation to helper] The function delegates to get_lowest_version_from_range_set(). Can bugs in the helper function (integer underflow, empty vec handling) propagate through this wrapper causing incorrect lowest version calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_state_version()] [None return handling] When states Vec is empty, returns None. Can this cause synchronization logic to fail during bootstrap or after aggressive state pruning where no full nodes advertise historical state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_state_version()] [Version 0 edge case] Does the function properly handle version 0 as a valid lowest version, or can this be confused with uninitialized/invalid state in downstream code that uses this value? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_transaction_output_version()] [Output availability mismatch] Can the lowest transaction output version be higher than the lowest transaction version, causing nodes to attempt executing transactions without available outputs, leading to execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_transaction_output_version()] [Pruning inconsistency] If different nodes prune transaction outputs at different rates, can inconsistent lowest_transaction_output_version values across the network cause synchronization to fail when requesting from nodes that have already pruned the required data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_transaction_output_version()] [None return semantic] When transaction_outputs Vec is empty, returns None. Can this be misinterpreted as 'no transaction outputs exist' vs 'no peer advertises outputs', leading to incorrect synchronization decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_transaction_version()] [Historical data attack] Can Byzantine nodes advertise transaction ranges starting from version 0 when they've actually pruned early history, causing requesting nodes to fail when trying to fetch genesis transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: lowest_transaction_version()] [Version gap exploitation] If the lowest transaction version is significantly higher than version 0 due to pruning, can attackers exploit nodes that require full history, forcing them into unrecoverable states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: get_lowest_version_from_range_set()] [Empty input handling] When data_ranges slice is empty, min() returns None. Can this cause unwrap() panics in calling code that doesn't expect None, leading to node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: get_lowest_version_from_range_set()] [lowest() method safety] Does CompleteDataRange::lowest() handle edge cases correctly (empty ranges, inverted ranges), or can it return invalid version numbers that break synchronization logic? (Medium)"
