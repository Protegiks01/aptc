  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [False Negative Risk] Could certain valid IP addresses fail to match blocklist ranges due to normalization differences (leading zeros, compression) creating false negatives that allow blocked users through? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Subnet Boundary] For a blocklist entry like 192.168.1.0/24, are addresses 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255 correctly included in the range, or do boundary cases slip through? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Single IP Range] Are single IPs (expressed as /32 for IPv4 or /128 for IPv6) correctly matched by the contains() method, or do they require special handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Default Route] If someone adds 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to the blocklist (effectively blocking all IPs), does the checker handle this correctly, or does it cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Reserved IP Handling] Are reserved/special IP ranges (224.0.0.0/4 multicast, 240.0.0.0/4 experimental) automatically rejected even if not in the blocklist, or must they be explicitly listed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Bypasser Interaction] If a Bypasser allows a request, does that completely skip IP blocklist checking, potentially allowing known malicious IPs to drain funds if they have valid bypass credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Rate Limiter Race] If IpBlocklistChecker runs before rate limiters, could an attacker from a non-blocked IP exhaust rate limits before being caught, versus running rate limiters first to reduce load on blocklist checking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Captcha Bypass] If captcha checkers run after IP blocklist, could blocked IPs still consume captcha quotas during failed checks, causing DoS on the captcha service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Auth Token Priority] Should IP blocklist checks run before or after auth token validation - does the current ordering (determined by cost()) create any security gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Metric Exposure] Are blocked IP attempts properly logged and metered for security monitoring, or do they silently fail without alerting operators to potential attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Log Injection] Could the IP address in the rejection message be attacker-controlled, allowing log injection attacks if the IP contains newlines or other special characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Audit Trail Gap] Without implementing complete(), there's no record of which requests were blocked in persistent storage - could this hinder incident response and forensic investigation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Metrics Cardinality] If IP addresses are included in metrics labels, could the high cardinality of IPv6 addresses cause metrics storage exhaustion and monitoring system failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing Attack] Does the contains() check take variable time based on blocklist size and IP position, leaking information about blocklist contents through timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Hash Collision] If the underlying IpRange uses hash-based lookups, could hash collisions cause incorrect contains() results where non-blocked IPs appear blocked or vice versa? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Dependencies] [IpRange Library CVE] Does the iprange crate dependency have any known CVEs or security issues that could affect the safety of IP blocklist checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Dependencies] [Ipnet Library CVE] Does the ipnet crate used for Ipv4Net and Ipv6Net parsing have any vulnerabilities in IP range parsing that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Dependencies] [Dependency Confusion] Could an attacker publish a malicious iprange or ipnet crate with a higher version number, causing supply chain compromise if dependencies aren't pinned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Distributed Attack] Can an attacker use a botnet of thousands of IPs to drain the faucet, where blocking individual IPs is ineffective because they can add more bots faster than blocklist updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [BGP Hijacking] If an attacker performs BGP hijacking to route traffic from a legitimate IP through their infrastructure, can they bypass IP blocklist while appearing to be a trusted source? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Tunneling] Can attackers use IPv6 tunneling protocols (6in4, GRE, AYIYA) to obfuscate their true source IP and bypass blocklist detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Tor Exit Node] If Tor exit node IPs are not comprehensively blocklisted, can attackers rotate through exit nodes to appear as different IPs and bypass per-IP restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [VPN Service Abuse] Can attackers subscribe to commercial VPN services with thousands of exit IPs, making IP-based blocking ineffective as they rotate through the VPN's IP pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Cloud Provider Bypass] If cloud provider IP ranges (AWS, Azure, GCP) aren't fully blocklisted, can attackers spin up cheap VMs to get fresh IPs for each funding request? (High)",
