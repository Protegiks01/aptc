  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Client] [Field validation] Does Client::new() validate that owner, repository, and branch fields are non-empty and contain only valid characters for GitHub, preventing configuration errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GetResponse] [Optional content handling] Can the Optional<String> content field be None in unexpected scenarios, causing validators to crash when unwrapping without proper validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GetResponse] [SHA validation] Is the sha field validated to be a proper git SHA hash, or can malformed SHA strings cause issues in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Branch] [Branch name overflow] Can extremely long branch names in the Branch struct cause memory issues or buffer overflows when processing branch lists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_sha()] [Directory error confusion] When get_sha is called on a directory, it returns InternalError - can this be confused with other internal errors, causing incorrect error handling by validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [SHA mismatch handling] When get_sha fails with NotFound, a new file is created - can race conditions cause multiple validators to believe they're creating new files when one already exists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_file()] [NotFound silencing] The function silently succeeds on NotFound errors - can this hide genuine configuration problems where validators expect files to exist but they don't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Path mismatch error] If get_internal returns multiple entries, an InternalError is thrown - can this legitimate error state be triggered in normal operations, causing validator failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error type confusion] Can different Error variants be incorrectly handled by calling code, leading to validators treating critical errors as recoverable or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Multi-validator race] When multiple validators simultaneously call put() with the same path, can GitHub API's last-write-wins behavior cause validators to diverge on which configuration version they use? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Concurrent modification] During recursive deletion, if another process adds files to the directory tree, can this cause partial deletions or infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Concurrent update race] Can a file be updated between the get_internal() call and content extraction, causing validators to read partial or corrupted data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Client] [Thread safety] Is the Client struct thread-safe for concurrent use by multiple validator threads, or can concurrent requests corrupt internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_directory()] [Directory iteration race] Can files be added or removed from a directory while get_directory() is iterating, causing inconsistent directory snapshots across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [All functions] [Rate limit handling] Does the client handle GitHub API rate limiting responses (429 status), or can rate limits cause validator operations to fail without retry logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [All functions] [Secondary rate limits] Does the client detect and handle GitHub's secondary rate limits for content creation/deletion, which could block validator configuration updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [API quota exhaustion] Can recursive deletion of large directories exhaust GitHub API quotas, preventing validators from performing critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [All functions] [Retry logic absence] Does the client implement exponential backoff for transient failures, or will temporary GitHub API outages immediately fail validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Content integrity] Are file contents cryptographically verified (e.g., comparing SHA with expected hash), or can GitHub repository compromise inject malicious validator configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Content validation] Does put() validate the format of content being uploaded (e.g., ensuring valid base64), or can malformed content be stored that breaks validators on read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Length validation] Can file contents exceed maximum safe sizes, causing memory exhaustion when loading large configuration files into validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Message injection] The commit message format uses user-controlled path in format! - can malicious paths inject newlines or commands into git commit messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: ACCEPT_HEADER/ACCEPT_VALUE] [Header confusion] The Accept header value includes 'Accept: ' prefix - can this malformed header cause GitHub API to reject requests or behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Header injection] Can token values containing CRLF sequences inject additional HTTP headers, potentially bypassing authentication or leaking credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [HTTP version downgrade] Does ureq enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+, or can protocol downgrade attacks expose validator credentials transmitted in Authorization header? (Critical)"
