  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Idempotency] Does the lack of event deduplication mechanisms allow malicious modules to emit the same MaximumMutate event thousands of times, exhausting indexer storage and processing resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Transaction rollback] If a transaction emitting MaximumMutate events is rolled back, can indexers that already processed these events become permanently desynchronized from validator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name forgery] Can an attacker create a malicious Move module that claims MODULE_NAME as 'token_event_store' but has different logic, causing type confusion when events are matched to handlers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name collision] Can a malicious module define a different struct also named 'MaximumMutate' that bypasses type checking, allowing injection of incompatible event data that crashes event processors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Version confusion] Does implementing MoveEventV2Type without explicit versioning allow mixing of incompatible event formats if the struct definition changes in future upgrades, breaking backward compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can an attacker modify the TypeTag at runtime (if accessed through unsafe code) to redirect event processing to incorrect handlers, causing type confusion vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [Lazy initialization] Does the Lazy<TypeTag> initialization have race conditions in multithreaded validator environments that could result in multiple TypeTag instances with different values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [TOKEN_ADDRESS constant] If TOKEN_ADDRESS (0x3) is compromised or incorrectly set, can all MaximumMutate events be routed to a malicious module at that address, enabling complete token supply manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Supply inflation] Can an attacker emit events with new_maximum set to u64::MAX, causing indexers and marketplaces to display artificially inflated token supplies that manipulate market prices and enable rug pulls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Supply deflation] Can setting new_maximum to 1 while actual circulating supply is higher create inconsistent state that breaks DEX pricing algorithms or causes integer underflows in market cap calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Flash loan attack] Can an attacker emit MaximumMutate events within a single transaction to temporarily manipulate token supply data, enabling flash loan attacks against DeFi protocols that query supply in real-time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [MEV exploitation] Can validators observing MaximumMutate events in the mempool frontrun token supply changes to profit from price movements before the events are finalized on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Market manipulation] Can emitting rapid sequences of contradictory MaximumMutate events (increasing then decreasing maximum) confuse automated trading bots and cause market instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: collection()] [String cloning] Does returning &String instead of &str create unnecessary reference counting overhead that could be exploited to exhaust memory in high-frequency event processing scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: token()] [Data leakage] Can the String references returned by getter methods be modified through unsafe code or interior mutability patterns, violating the immutability guarantees of event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: old_maximum()] [Reference misuse] Does returning &u64 instead of u64 create opportunities for pointer aliasing bugs in unsafe code that processes multiple events concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: new_maximum()] [Validation bypass] Can external code modify the new_maximum value after retrieval through unsafe pointer manipulation, bypassing all validation that occurred during event creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Does the new() constructor lack any validation of input parameters, allowing creation of logically invalid events (e.g., new_maximum < old_maximum, empty strings, zero addresses) that corrupt downstream systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Invariant violation] Can the constructor be called with new_maximum == old_maximum, creating no-op events that waste storage and processing resources while providing no meaningful information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [String allocation] Does the constructor accept owned Strings that could contain maliciously large allocations, causing memory exhaustion when many events are created in a single transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Creator verification] Does the constructor verify that the provided creator address actually owns the specified collection and token, or can anyone create events claiming arbitrary ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Deterministic serialization] Does the Serde serialization produce deterministic output for all field combinations, or can non-deterministic ordering cause different nodes to store different event hashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization size] Can the serialized size of MaximumMutate events exceed block size limits when collection/token strings are extremely long, causing transactions to be rejected after partial execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Backward compatibility] If the MaximumMutate struct is upgraded with new fields in the future, will old events fail to deserialize, breaking historical event replay for indexers and archives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leakage] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information in logs that could help attackers identify vulnerable tokens or plan supply manipulation attacks? (Low)"
