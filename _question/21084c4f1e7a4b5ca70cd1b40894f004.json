  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkMessage] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker send a maliciously crafted NetworkMessage with arbitrary Vec<u8> data that, when deserialized by serde, causes memory corruption, panic, or code execution on the receiving node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkMessage] [Sender Spoofing] Does the NetworkMessage.sender SocketAddr field have any cryptographic authentication, or can a malicious peer spoof the sender address to impersonate trusted nodes and bypass authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkMessage] [Message Type Confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the message_type field in NetworkMessage to route messages to unintended handlers, potentially bypassing security checks or causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: Message, lines 56-70] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker send Messages with extremely large Vec<u8> data payloads to exhaust node memory, causing OOM crashes and denial of service to the distributed execution system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: Message, line 59] [Unbounded Buffer] The Message.data field is a Vec<u8> with no size limits - can this lead to unbounded memory consumption when processing malicious messages from remote peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: MessageType, lines 30-44] [Type Confusion] MessageType uses a plain String without validation - can an attacker register arbitrary message types to hijack or intercept messages intended for legitimate handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: MessageType::new, line 37] [No Input Validation] The MessageType::new() function accepts any String without validation - can attackers use special characters, extremely long strings, or reserved keywords to cause parsing errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: MessageType::get_type, line 41] [String Cloning Overhead] The get_type() method clones the entire message_type string on every call - can this be exploited for DoS by triggering excessive allocations with large message type strings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: MessageType, line 30] [Hash Collision] MessageType implements Hash but relies on String hashing - can an attacker craft message type strings that cause hash collisions in handler registration HashMaps, leading to handler confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, lines 95-113] [Runtime Creation Panic] The new() function calls Runtime::new().unwrap() twice - if runtime creation fails (e.g., due to resource exhaustion), will this panic crash the entire node rather than returning an error? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, line 106] [Unbounded Runtime Resources] Each NetworkController creates two separate Tokio runtimes - can an attacker cause resource exhaustion by triggering creation of multiple NetworkControllers, each spawning unlimited thread pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, lines 95-100] [No Service Name Validation] The service String parameter is not validated - can attackers pass empty strings, extremely long strings, or strings with special characters to cause issues in GRPC service registration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, line 99] [Timeout Parameter] The timeout_ms parameter is u64 - can setting this to 0 or u64::MAX cause integer overflow in timeout calculations or indefinite blocking in the InboundHandler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, line 96] [Arc<Mutex> Lock Contention] InboundHandler is wrapped in Arc<Mutex> - under high concurrency, can this cause lock contention that degrades performance or enables timing attacks to infer internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, lines 115-126] [Unbounded Channel DoS] The function creates unbounded() crossbeam channels - can an attacker flood these channels with messages to cause unbounded memory growth and OOM crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 117] [No Peer Authentication] The remote_peer_addr parameter is not authenticated - can an attacker register channels for arbitrary peer addresses to intercept or redirect messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 118] [Duplicate Registration] Is there validation to prevent registering multiple handlers for the same (message_type, remote_peer_addr) pair, or can this cause message routing confusion and dropped messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 119] [No Sender Limit] The function returns a Sender<Message> with no rate limiting - can this be used to flood the network with messages and cause bandwidth exhaustion or peer disconnections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_inbound_channel, lines 128-137] [Unbounded Inbound Queue] Similar to outbound, inbound channels are unbounded - can malicious peers send unlimited messages to fill memory and crash the receiver? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_inbound_channel, lines 131-134] [Mutex Poisoning] The lock().unwrap() call can panic if the Mutex is poisoned - can an attacker trigger panic in another thread to poison the mutex and DoS all subsequent inbound channel creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_inbound_channel, line 129] [Duplicate Handler Registration] Can the same message_type be registered multiple times, and if so, which handler receives messages - could this cause message loss or routing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, lines 139-150] [Mutex Lock Without Timeout] The start() function acquires the inbound_handler mutex with lock().unwrap() - if the lock is held, will this block indefinitely and prevent startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, lines 144-148] [Race Condition] The inbound_server_shutdown_tx is assigned without synchronization - can concurrent calls to start() create race conditions where shutdown signals are lost or overwritten? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, line 149] [Overwriting Shutdown Handles] If start() is called multiple times, the previous shutdown handles are overwritten without being triggered - does this leak the old server tasks and prevent proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, lines 139-150] [No Startup Verification] After spawning async tasks, there's no verification that servers actually started - can network binding failures go undetected, causing silent failures in distributed execution? (High)"
