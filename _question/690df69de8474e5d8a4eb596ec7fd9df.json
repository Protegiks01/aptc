(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/mod.rs] [SerializationFormat enum] [Compressed vs uncompressed] Both compressed and uncompressed formats exist for G1/G2 points - could deserializing compressed format and re-serializing as uncompressed change the canonical representation, causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/mod.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Casting safety] Lines 344 and 364 register downcast_internal and upcast_internal - do these validate structure compatibility (e.g., downcasting Fq12 to Fq), or could invalid casts create elements in wrong algebraic structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/mod.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Upcast validation] When upcasting from a subfield to an extension field, is there validation that the element is canonically represented in the smaller field before embedding in the larger one? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/mod.rs] [HashToStructureSuite enum] [Domain separation] The two hash suites (lines 161-162) don't show domain separation tags - could hashing the same message to G1 and G2 produce related outputs, breaking security assumptions?
