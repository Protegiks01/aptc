  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 268-279] [Error context loss] If create_seed_peers() returns an error, does the calling code have enough context to know which chain (testnet/mainnet) failed, or is debugging complicated by insufficient error information? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 282-320] [Multi-error scenario] If multiple seed peer entries are invalid, does build_seed_peer() return only the first error or aggregate all errors? Can partial failure scenarios confuse operators about the extent of configuration problems? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Result vs panic] Does any code path use unwrap() or expect() that could cause panics instead of returning Result::Err, potentially crashing the node during startup instead of gracefully failing with a clear error message? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 170, 176] [Silent errors] The calls to set_listen_address_and_prepare_identity() use ? for error propagation - but are there scenarios where this can fail silently without any error, leaving networks in an uninitialized state? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_all_network_configs()] [Mutable aliasing] When iterating with &mut over full_node_networks, can other threads or async tasks modify the same vector, causing data races or iterator invalidation? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [File system race] Multiple nodes using the same storage.dir() could race on reading/writing IDENTITY_KEY_FILE - can this cause identity key corruption or theft if multiple processes access the file simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: NodeConfig::optimize()] [Async safety] If NodeConfig::optimize() is called from an async context, are the synchronous file I/O operations in identity key loading/saving blocking the async runtime and causing performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: NodeConfig::optimize()] [State mutation order] Can reordering of sub-config optimizer calls due to CPU instruction reordering cause security checks to be applied after vulnerable configurations are set, creating a window for attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 198] [Index out of bounds] The index used to access both node_config.full_node_networks and local_config_yaml arrays - can a mismatch in array lengths cause out-of-bounds access or incorrect config association? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 110-152] [Vector growth] The optimizers_with_modifications vector grows with each push - can an attacker trigger all optimizers to report modifications, causing excessive memory allocation that leads to OOM? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 270-276] [HashMap size] When creating seed_peers HashMap, is there bounds checking on the number of seed entries to prevent memory exhaustion attacks by providing extremely large seed peer arrays? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 296-301] [Public key validation] Does x25519::PublicKey::from_encoded_string() validate the key is in valid range and not a weak/identity point? Can weak keys be injected to enable passive decryption or MITM attacks on noise protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 230] [Private key exposure] When calling Identity::save_private_key(), is the key in memory properly zeroized after saving, or can it remain in memory where it could be dumped and stolen? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [Key generation entropy] The auto-generated identity key's randomness depends on the system's entropy - can an attacker with root access deplete entropy during node initialization to cause predictable keys to be generated? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: seed peer keys] [Key verification] Are the hardcoded x25519 public keys verified to be properly generated and not constructed to have known weaknesses (e.g., small subgroup attacks)? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 304-309] [DNS protocol validation] NetworkAddress::from_str() accepts /dns/ addresses - does it validate the DNS name doesn't contain null bytes, excessive length, or IDN homograph characters that could enable phishing or DNS rebinding? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 304-309] [Protocol validation] Can an attacker provide network addresses using unsupported protocols (e.g., /ws/, /wss/, /http/) that bypass security checks expecting /tcp/ or /quic/? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 304-309] [IPv6 handling] Does NetworkAddress parsing properly handle IPv6 addresses, or can IPv6-specific attacks (e.g., address parsing ambiguities, zone IDs) bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 313-316] [Multiple addresses] A Peer can have multiple addresses in the vec - does the network layer try all addresses or just the first? Can an attacker put malicious addresses first to be preferred over legitimate ones? (Medium)",

  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 191-192] [Type confusion] Can an attacker change the NodeType enum during runtime to bypass the is_validator() check and trigger seed peer loading for validator nodes, connecting validators to public untrusted peers? (Critical)",
