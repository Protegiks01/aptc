  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Division by zero] In line 42, can the division operation `total_covered as f64 / total_instructions as f64` cause a panic or produce NaN/Infinity when total_instructions equals zero if all modules are empty or native-only, potentially crashing the coverage tool? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Float precision] When calculating percentage in line 42, can floating-point precision errors accumulate with very large instruction counts (near u64::MAX), producing misleading coverage percentages that misrepresent test quality? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Arithmetic overflow] Can total_instructions or total_covered overflow during accumulation in lines 34-35 when processing many large modules, causing incorrect coverage statistics due to integer wraparound? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Panic vulnerability] Lines 22-24 and 38-45 use .unwrap() on writeln! results - can write failures to a full disk, closed pipe, or permission-denied file descriptor cause the coverage tool to panic and lose coverage data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Error handling] In line 32, the summarize_human() call uses .unwrap() - can errors from the summary_func implementation propagate as panics, causing loss of partial coverage data from successfully processed modules? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Panic vulnerability] Lines 56 and 60 use .unwrap() on write operations - can I/O errors during CSV generation cause data loss when coverage reports are written to network filesystems or containerized environments? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Empty collection] When modules.iter() in line 29 processes an empty slice, does the coverage calculation in line 42 produce NaN or division by zero, potentially causing downstream tools parsing the output to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Empty collection] If modules is an empty slice in line 58, does the CSV output still include the header but no data rows, or could this cause parsing errors in CI/CD pipelines expecting at least one data row? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Iterator side effects] Can the summary_func closure in line 30 have side effects that modify coverage_map or module state, causing non-deterministic coverage reports when the same data is analyzed multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Type constraint bypass] The generic type M has no trait bounds - can an attacker pass a malicious type implementing no useful methods, causing the summary_func to access uninitialized memory or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Closure safety] The closure F: Fn(&CompiledModule, &M) in line 20 has no lifetime constraints - can this lead to use-after-free if the closure captures references that outlive the coverage_map or modules?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Type parameter] The generic type M in line 48 has no Send/Sync bounds - could concurrent calls to format_csv_summary with shared coverage_map cause data races if M contains interior mutability? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Module validation] Does the function validate that CompiledModule instances in the modules slice are well-formed, or can malformed bytecode cause the summary_func to panic or produce corrupt coverage data?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Module ordering] Does the CSV output preserve module ordering from the input slice, or can non-deterministic iteration over modules cause flaky test results when coverage reports are diff-compared? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Integer overflow] In lines 34-35, the += operations can overflow if individual modules have near-u64::MAX instruction counts - is there overflow checking, or does this silently wrap around producing incorrect totals?
