  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Path traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the data_dir PathBuf field during deserialization to point to sensitive system directories (e.g., /etc/passwd, /root/.ssh) causing unauthorized file access or data exfiltration when the node writes state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Path traversal] Does the data_dir field validation prevent path traversal attacks using sequences like '../../../' to escape the intended data directory and overwrite critical system files or validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Symlink attack] Can an attacker create a symlink at the data_dir path pointing to a critical system location, causing the node to corrupt or overwrite validator consensus state or cryptographic keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) vulnerability where an attacker can modify the data_dir path between validation and actual use, redirecting file operations to malicious locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Directory permissions] Does the code verify that data_dir has restrictive permissions (e.g., 0700) to prevent unauthorized access to validator private keys, consensus state, or blockchain data by other users on the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Optional working_dir] Can a malicious configuration set working_dir to None or an invalid path causing the node to fail silently or use unexpected default directories that leak sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Working directory hijack] If working_dir is Some(path), can an attacker exploit it to change the node's working directory to a location they control, potentially affecting relative path resolution for other critical files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Disk space exhaustion] Does BaseConfig validate that data_dir has sufficient disk space before initialization, or can an attacker cause consensus failure by filling the disk during operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Role type manipulation] Can a malicious actor deserialize a config with role set to Validator when they should be FullNode, gaining unauthorized validator privileges and participating in consensus without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Struct: BaseConfig] [Waypoint injection] During deserialization, can an attacker inject a malicious waypoint value that points to a forked chain state, causing nodes to follow an invalid blockchain history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Insecure default] Does the default data_dir path '/opt/aptos/data' have secure permissions, or can attackers with local access exploit world-readable/writable permissions to tamper with consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Default role escalation] The default role is set to RoleType::Validator - can this lead to privilege escalation if a FullNode mistakenly uses default config and gains validator authority without proper stake or authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Waypoint None bypass] The default waypoint is WaypointConfig::None - does this allow nodes to start without genesis validation, potentially joining incorrect network forks or malicious chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Production deployment risk] Can the default() implementation be accidentally used in production deployments, leading to nodes running with insecure default paths and missing critical security configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Waypoint validation bypass] The sanitizer only checks if waypoint is WaypointConfig::None - can an attacker provide a malformed but non-None waypoint (e.g., FromFile with invalid path) that bypasses this check but crashes later during startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Incomplete validation] Does sanitize() perform comprehensive validation of data_dir and working_dir paths, or does it only check waypoint, allowing path traversal attacks to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Role validation missing] The sanitizer doesn't verify if the role field is valid for the node_type parameter - can a FullNode node_type run with Validator role, circumventing access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Unused parameters] The _node_type and _chain_id parameters are unused - are there missing validation checks that should verify config consistency with the intended node type and chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [TOCTOU in validation] After sanitize() passes, can the config be modified before use (e.g., through shared references or race conditions) allowing invalid configurations to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error message leakage] The error message 'The waypoint config must be set in the base config!' could leak internal implementation details - does this expose information useful for crafting attacks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: WaypointConfig] [None variant exploit] Even though sanitize() rejects WaypointConfig::None, can attackers exploit race conditions or deserialization vulnerabilities to set waypoint to None after validation, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: WaypointConfig] [Storage backend tampering] For FromStorage variant, can an attacker with access to the SecureBackend modify the stored waypoint to redirect nodes to a malicious fork without detection? (Critical)",
