  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Function: get_valid_proposer()] [Transaction ordering bias] If certain validators are heavily favored in the round mapping, could they exploit their disproportionate proposal power to reorder transactions for MEV extraction or censorship? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: RoundProposer] [Lifetime bounds] Are there hidden lifetime parameters in the struct or trait that could cause use-after-free if the proposers HashMap outlives the data it references? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Function: get_valid_proposer()] [VRF bypass] In systems using VRF for randomness, does RoundProposer bypass VRF checks by using deterministic mapping, potentially weakening unpredictability guarantees expected by other consensus components? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Function: new()] [Governance attack] Can a malicious governance proposal pass a ProposerElectionType::RoundProposer configuration that maps all future rounds to addresses controlled by the attacker, effectively taking over the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: RoundProposer] [Hashmap collision DOS] Could an attacker craft a sequence of round numbers that all hash to the same bucket in the HashMap, degrading get_valid_proposer() performance to O(n) and slowing consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Function: get_valid_proposer()] [Voting power bypass] Does this proposer election respect voting power/stake weight, or does it treat all validators equally regardless of stake, potentially allowing Sybil attacks with multiple low-stake validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Function: get_valid_proposer()] [Round gap exploitation] If there are large gaps in the HashMap (e.g., only odd rounds mapped), do the unmapped even rounds all go to default_proposer, creating predictable patterns attackers can exploit? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/round_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: RoundProposer] [Borrowing issues] When get_valid_proposer() borrows &self, could there be conflicts with other code trying to mutate or replace the RoundProposer instance, causing borrow checker errors or unsafe behavior? (Medium)"
