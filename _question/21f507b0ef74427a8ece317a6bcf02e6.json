  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Panic/DoS] Can an attacker craft a malicious manifest file with invalid address strings that trigger the unwrap() call on line 62, causing a panic that crashes the CLI tool or validator node during package deployment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Error Handling] Does the TODO comment on line 61 indicating 'Cleanup unwrap' mean that error conditions in load_manifest_account_arg are not properly propagated, allowing malformed addresses to cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [DoS Attack] Can an attacker submit manifests with extremely long address strings (e.g., millions of characters) that cause the deserializer to consume excessive memory or CPU during the unwrap() call on line 62? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Input Validation] What happens if load_manifest_account_arg returns an error but the unwrap() on line 62 is called - can this be exploited to crash validator nodes processing malicious package manifests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker craft a manifest with deeply nested BTreeMap structures in addresses, dev_addresses, dependencies, or dev_dependencies fields that cause stack overflow or exponential deserialization time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Address Validation] Can an attacker bypass address validation by providing a None address that serializes as '_', then use this in package deployment to deploy code to arbitrary system addresses like 0x1 or 0x3? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Address Confusion] Does the serialization of None as '_' on line 49 allow for address confusion attacks where a package deployed with '_' could later be reinterpreted as a different address during upgrade or migration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: ManifestNamedAddress] [Type Confusion] Can the conversion between Option<AccountAddress> and ManifestNamedAddress in lines 29-38 be exploited to create type confusion where None is treated as Some or vice versa in critical security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Address Namespace] Can an attacker register malicious addresses in both the 'addresses' field (line 16) and 'dev-addresses' field (line 18) with the same key name, causing namespace collisions that override production addresses with dev addresses during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::from(Option<AccountAddress>)] [Null Pointer] Is there any scenario where converting from Option<AccountAddress> to ManifestNamedAddress on line 30-32 could result in unsafe memory access if the AccountAddress itself is in an invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Address Formatting] Can the to_hex_literal() call on line 47 be exploited with malformed AccountAddress structures to produce incorrect hex representations that bypass validation in downstream components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: ManifestNamedAddress] [Canonical Representation] Does the lack of canonicalization between deserialization (line 62) and serialization (line 47) allow attackers to create multiple manifest representations of the same address for signature bypass or caching attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Dependency Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the multiple dependency source options (local line 71, git line 73, aptos line 79) by providing conflicting sources in a single Dependency, causing the package system to fetch malicious code from an unintended source? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Git URL Injection] Does the git field (line 73) validate URLs to prevent command injection attacks where malicious URLs like 'git://evil.com/repo$(malicious_command)' could execute arbitrary commands during git clone? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Path Traversal] Can the local field (line 71) be exploited with path traversal sequences like '../../../etc/passwd' to read sensitive files or overwrite critical system files during package compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Subdir Traversal] Does the subdir field (line 77) validate against path traversal attacks, or can an attacker use '../../' sequences to access parent directories outside the intended git repository? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Git Rev Injection] Can the rev field (line 75) be manipulated with malicious git revision specifiers (e.g., tags with command injection, ref names with special characters) to exploit git command execution vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Supply Chain Attack] Does the aptos field (line 79) validate package names against a whitelist of official packages, or can attackers specify typosquatted package names to trick users into importing malicious framework versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Address Override] Can the address field (line 81) be used to override the actual deployed address of a dependency, allowing attackers to redirect dependency resolution to malicious contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Dependency Shadowing] Can malicious dev-dependencies (line 21) shadow production dependencies (line 19) during testing, causing developers to test against different code than what gets deployed in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Symlink Attack] If the local field points to a symlink, can an attacker exploit TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities to replace the symlink target between validation and compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Dependency Pinning] Does the absence of hash or checksum fields in Dependency allow man-in-the-middle attacks where git dependencies are replaced with malicious code during clone without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Name Injection] Can the package name field (line 87) contain special characters or escape sequences that cause injection attacks in downstream systems (e.g., shell commands, database queries, log parsers)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Version Confusion] Does the version field (line 88) follow semantic versioning constraints, or can attackers provide malformed versions like '999.999.999' or negative versions to bypass upgrade restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Author Spoofing] Can the authors field (line 89) be manipulated to impersonate trusted developers, potentially tricking users into deploying malicious packages that appear to come from legitimate sources? (Medium)"
