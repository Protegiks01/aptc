  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for StateViewError] [Error Information Loss] When converting AptosDbError to StateViewError at lines 68-76, does the wildcard pattern at line 73 lose critical error variants (TooManyRequested, MissingRootError) that execution layer needs to handle differently? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for StateViewError] [State Access Violation] Can the conversion of NotFound errors at line 71 mask unauthorized state access attempts that should trigger security alerts, making it indistinguishable from legitimate missing keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for StateViewError] [Gas Metering Bypass] If storage errors are converted to StateViewError and then mishandled by VM, could this allow transactions to bypass gas charges for storage operations that failed, enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",

  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for StateViewError] [Move VM Error Propagation] When RocksDb or IO errors are converted to StateViewError::Other, does the Move VM properly halt transaction execution, or could it continue with stale state causing incorrect transaction outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for AptosDbError] [BCS Error Handling] At line 83, StateViewError::BcsError is converted to AptosDbError::BcsError using to_string(), but does this preserve enough information to debug Byzantine state serialization attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for AptosDbError] [Bidirectional Conversion Loss] Do the bidirectional conversions between AptosDbError (lines 68-76) and StateViewError (lines 78-86) preserve all error semantics, or does information loss during round-trip conversion cause mishandling in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for AptosDbError] [Error Code Injection] Can an attacker craft StateViewError messages that, when converted to AptosDbError at lines 78-86, inject misleading error codes that cause validators to take wrong recovery actions? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Consensus Safety] If two validators experience different error types (one RocksDbIncompleteResult, one NotFound) when accessing the same state key, does error handling ensure both reach same conclusion or could they commit conflicting blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Pruning Race Condition] Can MissingRootError at line 19-20 occur non-deterministically if one validator queries state exactly during pruning while another queries just before, causing state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [State Proof Verification] When merkle proof verification fails due to NotFound error, does the code properly distinguish between 'key legitimately doesn't exist' vs 'merkle tree corrupted', preventing acceptance of invalid state proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Epoch Boundary] During epoch transitions when state is being resharded, can timing-dependent errors (IoError, RecvError) cause some validators to see old epoch state while others see new epoch, breaking validator set updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Transaction Ordering] If TooManyRequested error triggers during parallel transaction execution, does error recovery ensure transaction order remains deterministic across validators or could it cause nonce sequence violations? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Snapshot Consistency] Can RocksDbIncompleteResult errors during snapshot creation result in partially committed state snapshots that, when restored, produce different state roots than original chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Validator Slashing] If storage errors cause a validator to miss block signing deadline, does error propagation ensure proper differentiation between Byzantine behavior (deserves slashing) vs infrastructure failure (no slashing)? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [State Synchronization] During fast sync, if NotFound errors occur for recent state items, does error handling properly trigger full state sync vs incorrectly assuming data will arrive later, causing permanent desync? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Gas Exhaustion] Can BcsError during transaction deserialization be exploited to cause repeated retries that consume gas without making progress, enabling DoS against transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Rollback Safety] If Other error occurs during state rollback after failed transaction, does error handling ensure atomicity or could partial rollback leave database in inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Byzantine Fault Detection] Do the error types defined in this file provide sufficient granularity for consensus to distinguish between crash faults (retryable) and Byzantine faults (requires validator ejection)? (High)",

  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Serialization Round-Trip] Are AptosDbError instances themselves BCS-serializable for network transmission, and if so, could malformed serialized errors cause receiver to crash or misinterpret error semantics? (High)"
