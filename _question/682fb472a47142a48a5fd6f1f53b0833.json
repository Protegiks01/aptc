  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: APTOS_GA_API_SECRET] [Secret exposure] Are the hardcoded Google Analytics credentials (APTOS_GA_API_SECRET) publicly accessible in the repository, allowing any attacker to send arbitrary telemetry data to Aptos' GA account and potentially poison metrics or exhaust quota? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: APTOS_GA_API_SECRET] [Secret rotation] The TODO comment indicates these credentials should be rotated periodically - has the hardcoded API secret ever been rotated since initial commit, or can attackers still use old credentials found in git history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: APTOS_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID] [Data poisoning] Can an attacker who obtains the hardcoded APTOS_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID send fabricated analytics events to manipulate Aptos Labs' understanding of network behavior or node distribution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constants: APTOS_GA_API_SECRET, APTOS_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID] [Quota exhaustion] Can an attacker use the publicly available GA credentials to flood Google Analytics with requests, exhausting Aptos' GA quota and causing telemetry collection failures that mask real network issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY] [Telemetry bypass] Can a malicious validator set ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY to hide their malicious behavior from Aptos monitoring systems, making it harder to detect Byzantine behavior or consensus violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_FORCE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY] [Privacy violation] Does ENV_APTOS_FORCE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY override user privacy preferences, and can it be set by system administrators to force telemetry collection on nodes that explicitly disabled it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constants: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY, ENV_APTOS_FORCE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY] [Conflicting flags] What happens when both ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY and ENV_APTOS_FORCE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY are set simultaneously - is there a clear precedence, or can this create inconsistent behavior that allows telemetry to be selectively enabled/disabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH_METRICS] [Selective monitoring bypass] Can a compromised validator selectively disable only metrics pushing while keeping logs enabled, allowing them to hide performance degradation or consensus slowdowns from monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH_LOGS] [Audit trail manipulation] Can an attacker disable telemetry log pushing to prevent their malicious activities from being recorded in centralized logging systems, making post-incident forensics impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH_EVENTS] [Event suppression] Can disabling event pushing via ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY_PUSH_EVENTS hide critical security events like failed authentication attempts or consensus violations from the Aptos Labs monitoring infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_PROMETHEUS_NODE_METRICS] [Prometheus bypass] Can a Byzantine validator disable Prometheus metrics collection to hide resource exhaustion attacks or performance anomalies that would normally trigger alerts in monitoring dashboards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_LOG_ENV_POLLING] [Configuration drift] If ENV_APTOS_DISABLE_LOG_ENV_POLLING is set, can attackers prevent runtime logging configuration updates, causing nodes to miss critical log level changes during incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL] [URL hijacking] Can an attacker set ENV_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL to point to a malicious server and intercept all telemetry data sent by validator nodes, potentially exposing sensitive network topology or validator IP addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL] [MITM attack] Does the telemetry system validate SSL certificates when connecting to TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL, or can an attacker with network access perform MITM attacks to intercept or modify telemetry data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: GA4_URL] [Third-party dependency] The GA4_URL points to Google's servers - if Google Analytics is compromised or subject to government subpoena, could adversaries obtain telemetry data about validator locations, version distributions, or network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAINNET_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL] [Network segregation] Is there proper validation to ensure mainnet nodes only send data to MAINNET_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL and not to the general TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL, preventing mainnet data from leaking to testnet monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constants: GA4_URL, TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL] [Protocol enforcement] The comment states GA4_URL requires HTTPS - is this requirement actually enforced in code, or can an attacker downgrade the protocol to HTTP and intercept unencrypted telemetry traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: ENV_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL] [URL injection] Is there any validation on the ENV_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_URL value to prevent injection of malicious URLs with embedded credentials, path traversal sequences, or protocol handlers (file://, ftp://)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: NODE_BUILD_INFO_FREQ_SECS] [Update detection delay] With NODE_BUILD_INFO_FREQ_SECS set to 60 minutes, can attackers run outdated vulnerable node versions for up to an hour before the telemetry system detects they haven't upgraded to a critical security patch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: NODE_CORE_METRICS_FREQ_SECS] [Metric staleness] At 30-second intervals for NODE_CORE_METRICS_FREQ_SECS, can an attacker exploit a vulnerability, perform malicious actions, and then restore normal behavior within the 30-second window to avoid detection in core metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: NODE_NETWORK_METRICS_FREQ_SECS] [Network attack window] With 60-second intervals for NODE_NETWORK_METRICS_FREQ_SECS, can attackers launch short-duration network partitioning attacks or eclipse attacks that complete within the monitoring window?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/constants.rs] [Constant: CHAIN_ACCESS_CHECK_FREQ_SECS] [Chain partition window] With 30-minute intervals for CHAIN_ACCESS_CHECK_FREQ_SECS, can an attacker cause a temporary chain partition or block a validator's chain access for up to 30 minutes before telemetry detects the issue?
