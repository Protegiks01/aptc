  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Replay attack] Since Script lacks built-in replay protection (no nonce or sequence number), can the same Script be executed multiple times if external replay protection fails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Module upgrade race] Can attackers exploit timing windows during module upgrades by calling EntryFunction with old or new module versions, causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Gas estimation bypass] Can attackers craft Script bytecode that appears small but executes expensive operations, bypassing gas estimation and causing validators to waste resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Bytecode obfuscation] Can attackers obfuscate malicious Script bytecode to bypass static analysis tools and hide expensive operations from gas estimators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Argument size vs gas] Can attackers create EntryFunction calls with large arguments that consume excessive gas during deserialization but appear cheap in initial validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Type instantiation cost] Can attackers exploit expensive generic type instantiations in EntryFunction to consume excessive gas without proportional payment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Code integrity] Since Script.code is mutable during construction, can attackers modify bytecode after initial validation but before execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Signature coverage] Do transaction signatures cover all Script fields (code, ty_args, args), or can attackers modify some fields after signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Module hash bypass] Can attackers exploit EntryFunction to call functions from modules with invalid or manipulated code hashes, bypassing integrity checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Argument commitment] Are EntryFunction arguments cryptographically committed in transaction signatures, or can they be manipulated after signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Concurrent cloning] Can concurrent Clone operations on shared Script objects cause data races or memory corruption if the underlying code vector is being modified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Module reference race] Can concurrent access to EntryFunction.module during transaction execution cause use-after-free if the module is upgraded or deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Serialization race] Can concurrent serialization and modification of Script objects lead to corrupted serialized output or partial writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Empty bytecode] Can attackers create Script objects with empty code vectors, causing unexpected behavior or crashes in bytecode verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Zero-length arguments] Can Script.args contain TransactionArguments with zero length or null values that violate VM expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Empty module name] Can EntryFunction.module contain a ModuleId with empty or invalid name components that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Maximum identifier length] Can attackers use extremely long Identifier values for function names to cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion in string operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: EntryFunction] [Null bytes in arguments] Can EntryFunction.args contain null bytes or invalid UTF-8 sequences that cause parsing errors or security issues in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [TypeTag limit] Is there a limit on the number or nesting depth of TypeTag values in ty_args, or can attackers cause stack overflow? (High)"
