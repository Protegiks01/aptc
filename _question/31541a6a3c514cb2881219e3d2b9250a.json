  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PrivateKey] [Concurrent signing] If multiple threads sign with the same private key simultaneously, are there race conditions in ExpandedSecretKey creation or signing operations that could leak key material or produce invalid signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PublicKey] [Concurrent verification] Can concurrent signature verifications with the same public key create race conditions that cause valid signatures to be rejected or invalid signatures to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: hash() for Ed25519PublicKey] [Hash state race condition] The hash implementation writes bytes to a Hasher - if the Hasher is shared across threads, can race conditions cause hash collisions or incorrect hash values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign_arbitrary_message() with fuzzing feature] [Test code in production] The fuzzing feature exposes sign_arbitrary_message publicly - if this feature is accidentally enabled in production, can attackers bypass domain separation and forge signatures for arbitrary data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: arbitrary() for Ed25519PublicKey] [Arbitrary key generation] The arbitrary() method can generate any public key including invalid ones - if this is used in production code paths, can attackers inject invalid keys into the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: keypair_strategy()] [Predictable test keys] If test key generation strategies are used in production, can attackers predict validator keys and compromise the consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign()] [Domain separation] The sign() method uses signing_message() for domain separation - is this domain separation sufficient to prevent cross-protocol attacks where signatures from one Aptos context are replayed in another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign_arbitrary_message()] [Context-free signing] The sign_arbitrary_message bypasses CryptoHash domain separation - in test/fuzzing mode, can this allow creation of signatures that are valid in production contexts without proper hashing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign()] [CryptoHash dependency] If the CryptoHash trait implementation has vulnerabilities, can attackers exploit them through the sign() method to create signature collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Dependency: ed25519_dalek] [Library vulnerability] The implementation fully delegates to ed25519_dalek - if that library has vulnerabilities (e.g., batch verification bypass, signature malleability), does Aptos inherit all those vulnerabilities without mitigation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Dependency: curve25519_dalek] [Curve implementation] Does curve25519_dalek properly handle all edge cases including point at infinity, small subgroups, and invalid curve points, or could implementation bugs compromise Aptos signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Algorithm: Ed25519] [Quantum resistance] Ed25519 is not quantum-resistant - is there a migration path for post-quantum cryptography, or will all historical signatures become forgeable when quantum computers become practical? (Low - long-term)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Derive macro: SerializeKey] [Serialization implementation] The SerializeKey derive macro handles serialization - does it properly handle all edge cases like endianness, padding, and alignment to ensure deterministic serialization across platforms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Derive macro: DeserializeKey] [Deserialization bounds] Does DeserializeKey properly limit input size and validate all fields to prevent attacks where malicious serialized data causes memory corruption or DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Constant: AIP_80_PREFIX] [Prefix collision] The AIP-80 prefix 'ed25519-priv-' and 'ed25519-pub-' could collide with other encoding schemes - can this cause key confusion where private keys are interpreted as public keys or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PrivateKey] [Key rotation] Is there proper support for validator key rotation without breaking existing signatures or consensus state, or could key rotation cause validators to be unable to sign new blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PublicKey] [Key revocation] Can compromised public keys be revoked from the validator set, or once a key is added, is it permanent creating a security risk if validators are compromised? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: PartialEq] [Key deduplication] The equality checks allow identifying duplicate keys - but is this used to prevent the same key from being registered multiple times as different validators for Sybil attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PrivateKey] [Type confusion] The inner ed25519_dalek::SecretKey is pub(crate) - can code within the aptos-crypto crate bypass safety checks by directly accessing the inner key and performing unsafe operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Struct: Ed25519PublicKey] [Newtype pattern bypass] The pub(crate) visibility allows crate-internal code to access the raw dalek types - can this be exploited to bypass validation or create invalid keys within the crate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Derive macro: SilentDebug] [Debug information leak] SilentDebug prevents accidentally logging private keys, but are there other code paths (Display, ToString, error messages) where private key material could leak into logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: derive_scalar()] [Array indexing] The code indexes expanded_bytes[..32] - is this indexing bounds-checked, or could buffer over-reads occur if ExpandedSecretKey changes its internal format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: genesis()] [Array initialization] The genesis key sets buf[ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH - 1] = 1 - if the length constant is incorrectly defined as 0, could this cause integer underflow and memory corruption? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign_arbitrary_message()] [Signature generation cost] Each signature requires creating an ExpandedSecretKey - can attackers force validators to generate excessive signatures (e.g., through proposal spam) causing performance degradation and consensus slowdown?
