  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error handling] Does the main() function properly propagate all errors from generate_update_proposal(), or could silent failures allow malformed gas schedule proposals to be written to disk without alerting operators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] If generate_update_proposal() panics during execution, could it leave partially-written proposal files on disk that operators might mistakenly submit to governance, causing chain halt or consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Result unwrapping] Does the Result<()> propagation properly handle all error cases, or could unwrap() calls in the call chain cause unexpected panics during production proposal generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input validation] When GenArgs::parse() processes command-line arguments, can an attacker inject malicious paths in the --output parameter to write proposals outside intended directories, potentially overwriting critical system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integer overflow] Can the --gas-feature-version parameter accept u64::MAX or other extreme values that could cause integer overflow in gas schedule calculations, leading to incorrect gas costs that break economic security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path traversal] Does GenArgs validation prevent path traversal attacks via the --output parameter (e.g., '--output ../../etc/malicious'), allowing attackers to write proposals to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command injection] If the output path from GenArgs is used in shell commands or external process invocations, could special characters in the path enable command injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerability where an attacker could modify the output directory between argument parsing and file writing, redirecting proposals to malicious locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [Gas schedule integrity] Can the generated proposal include gas parameters set to zero or extremely low values that would enable DoS attacks by making expensive operations essentially free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [Feature version manipulation] If an attacker specifies a manipulated --gas-feature-version that's higher than LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION, could this bypass version validation checks and introduce undefined behavior in gas metering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [Determinism failure] Does the proposal generation produce identical output for the same inputs across different machines and architectures, or could non-determinism cause validators to reject proposals due to hash mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [BCS serialization] Can malformed BCS encoding in the generated gas_schedule_blob bypass deserialization checks in the on-chain gas_schedule::set_for_next_epoch() function, allowing arbitrary data injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [Blob size limit] The lib.rs asserts gas_schedule_blob.len() < 65536, but does main.rs validate this before calling generate_update_proposal(), preventing attackers from generating oversized proposals that cause stack overflows or memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal()] [AccountAddress injection] The generated script uses AccountAddress::ONE (@0x1) - can this be manipulated to target a different address, potentially allowing unauthorized accounts to execute gas schedule changes?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal() → write_to_disk()] [File permissions] Are generated proposal files created with secure permissions (0600), or could world-readable permissions allow unauthorized users to read sensitive gas schedule data before governance execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main() → generate_update_proposal() → write_to_disk()] [Atomic writes] Does file writing use atomic operations (write-then-rename), or can a crash during write leave corrupted partial proposals that operators might accidentally submit to governance?
