  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network buffer limits] Are there limits on the size of execution requests that can be sent to each shard's socket address, or can oversized requests cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Malicious coordinator] If < 1/3 Byzantine validators control the coordinator_address, can they manipulate execution requests to specific shards to cause state divergence without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard censorship] Can a malicious validator running a ThreadExecutorService selectively drop or delay execution requests for certain transactions to censor specific users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Byzantine shard responses] If a Byzantine validator returns incorrect execution results from their shard, how does the coordinator detect and reject these results to maintain consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Denial of service via shutdown] Can a Byzantine validator repeatedly shutdown and restart their ThreadExecutorService to slow down block execution and degrade network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Test-only assumptions] Does the implementation assume localhost networking (as seen in tests) that would fail or introduce security issues in distributed production environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Deterministic port allocation] Do tests use deterministic port allocation that could conflict if multiple test instances run concurrently, and could similar issues occur in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Test sleep dependencies] Tests require sleep delays for server readiness (as noted in test comments) - does production code have similar race conditions that could cause failures without artificial delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [ShardId type safety] Since ShardId is just a type alias for usize, can incorrect values be passed that violate shard invariants but pass type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [API misuse prevention] Can callers create ThreadExecutorService with invalid parameter combinations (e.g., shard_id >= num_shards) that should be rejected but aren't due to lack of validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Lifetime annotations] Are there any lifetime annotation issues that could cause dangling references to the executor_service or network addresses after shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Version compatibility] If the underlying ExecutorService implementation changes between protocol versions, can ThreadExecutorService adapt without breaking changes or security regressions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration migration] During network upgrades, can changes to num_shards or shard topology cause existing ThreadExecutorService instances to become invalid or behave insecurely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network partition handling] If network partitions separate some remote_shard_addresses from the coordinator, how does ThreadExecutorService detect and handle this to prevent inconsistent execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Address reachability] Does the code validate that all addresses in remote_shard_addresses are reachable before starting execution, or can unreachable shards cause hangs or timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [NAT traversal] Can validators behind NAT or firewalls correctly participate in sharded execution, or will address binding fail for the self_address extracted from remote_shard_addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Error visibility] Are there logging or metrics that expose when ThreadExecutorService encounters errors, or do failures occur silently making debugging and security monitoring difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Shutdown confirmation] Does shutdown() provide confirmation that cleanup completed successfully, or can partial shutdowns go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty address vector] What happens if remote_shard_addresses is empty when new() is called? Does it panic, return error, or silently create invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Duplicate addresses] If remote_shard_addresses contains duplicate SocketAddr entries, can this cause multiple shards to bind to the same address, creating network conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Self-reference] What if shard_id points to an address that equals coordinator_address? Can this create network loops or self-messaging issues? (Low)"
