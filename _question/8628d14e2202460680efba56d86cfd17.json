  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/interpolate.rs] [Function: vanishing_poly()] [Panic on empty input] Can an attacker cause a validator node panic by providing an empty xs array to vanishing_poly(), which calls .last().unwrap() without checking if the multiplication tree is non-empty, potentially causing denial of service during DKG ceremonies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/interpolate.rs] [Function: interpolate()] [Array length mismatch] Can an attacker exploit interpolate() by providing xs and ys arrays of different lengths, causing the parallel zip iterator to silently truncate to the shorter length and produce incorrect polynomial coefficients that could compromise secret sharing schemes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/interpolate.rs] [Function: interpolate()] [Empty input arrays] Does interpolate() properly handle empty xs and ys arrays, or will the parallel reduction produce an empty polynomial that breaks PVSS transcript verification and allows invalid shares to be accepted?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/interpolate.rs] [Function: interpolate()] [Single point interpolation] Can an attacker exploit the edge case where xs and ys contain only a single element, causing other_xs to be empty and the lagrange() function to compute an incorrect denominator (Fr::one()) that doesn't match the expected Lagrange basis?
