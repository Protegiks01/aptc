  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal Handling] Are SIGINT/SIGTERM signals properly handled to gracefully shutdown the emitter, or can forced termination leave the coin source account in an inconsistent state with pending transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment Variable Injection] Can environment variables override critical configuration like cluster endpoints or chain IDs, allowing an attacker with env access to redirect the emitter to malicious infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Transaction Reordering] If validators process the diagnostic transaction at different speeds, can the sequence number polling at diag.rs:43-74 incorrectly conclude that some nodes are unhealthy when they're just slower? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Memory Exhaustion] The all_instances().collect() at diag.rs:25 loads all instances into memory - can an attacker specify millions of instances in targets_file, causing OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Transaction Replay] If the same diagnostic transaction is submitted multiple times due to retries, can this cause double-spending or sequence number conflicts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Stats Manipulation] Can an attacker modify the stats object returned by emit_transactions() before it's printed, causing operators to see falsified performance metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Funding Source Validation] Does create_accounts_command verify that the coin source account has sufficient balance before attempting to create accounts, or can it fail midway leaving some accounts unfunded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Query Amplification] At diag.rs:48-50, each iteration queries all instances - can this be exploited as a DDoS amplification vector where one diag() call generates thousands of API requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Result Interpretation] The results vector at diag.rs:51 - if some queries fail and others succeed, how are partial failures handled? Can this cause incorrect health assessments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Print Timing] The continuous printing at diag.rs:64 - can this fill up logs or terminal buffers, causing performance degradation or making real errors hard to spot? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Metrics Collection] Are transaction statistics collected in a way that prevents information leakage about validator performance that could be used to target specific nodes for attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Workload Injection] Can emit_workload_args.args_to_transaction_mix_per_phase() be manipulated to inject custom Move bytecode or transaction types not intended by the emitter design? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Stdout Buffer Overflow] Do the println! statements at lines 91-92 and diag.rs:37,76 properly handle extremely large stat objects or error messages that could overflow output buffers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Sequence Number Overflow] If the diagnostic runs for extended periods, can coin_source_account.sequence_number() overflow u64, causing sequence number wraparound and transaction rejection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Client Connection Leak] Are the rest_client() instances properly closed after diag() completes, or can repeated diag runs leak connections and exhaust file descriptors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Transaction Signing] Does the transaction signing process use secure key storage, or can private keys be extracted from process memory during emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Duration Validation] Does emit_args contain duration limits that are validated, or can an attacker specify infinite duration causing the emitter to run forever and drain all funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Account Enumeration] Can an attacker enumerate all created accounts by observing the pattern of account addresses, then target specific accounts for attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Network Partition Detection] Can the health check at diag.rs:43-74 distinguish between network partitions and slow nodes, or does it incorrectly flag partitioned nodes as unhealthy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Byzantine Validator Handling] If one instance is Byzantine and always reports incorrect sequence numbers, does the all_good check at diag.rs:52 properly detect this, or can a single malicious node cause permanent failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Cluster Configuration Tampering] Can an attacker with file system access modify the targets_file referenced by ClusterArgs to redirect the emitter to malicious endpoints? (High)",
