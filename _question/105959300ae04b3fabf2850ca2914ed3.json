  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 13] [Access Control] Is the public export of 'context' module (line 13) intentional, or does this expose internal implementation details that should remain private, potentially allowing unauthorized access to Context internals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-29] [Module Visibility] Are all private module declarations (lines 7-29) properly scoped, or could a malicious crate dependency gain access to internal modules through Rust's module system, bypassing intended access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 60] [Public Export] Does the public export of 'Context' (line 60) expose sensitive blockchain state or database readers to external callers, potentially allowing unauthorized state queries or resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 61] [Error Exposure] Does the public export of 'BasicError' (line 61) leak sensitive internal error details that could aid attackers in understanding system internals or exploiting error handling logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 62] [Runtime Exposure] Do the exported runtime functions 'attach_poem_to_runtime', 'bootstrap', and 'get_api_service' (line 62) allow external callers to manipulate API server lifecycle, potentially causing denial of service or unauthorized server spawning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 58-59, 27] [Test Exposure] The comment on lines 58-59 states exports are 'just for the test-context crate' but they're publicly exported - can production code abuse test-only Context or tests module (line 27) to bypass security checks or access test-only functionality? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 26-27] [Test Module] Is the tests module (lines 26-27) properly cfg-gated to prevent inclusion in production builds, or could test code with reduced security checks be accessible in production deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 32-56] [API Categorization] Does the ApiTags enum (lines 32-56) lack fine-grained access control categories, potentially allowing endpoints to be miscategorized and bypass intended authentication/authorization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 42-43] [Experimental APIs] The 'Experimental' tag (lines 42-43) notes 'no guarantees' - can attackers abuse experimental endpoints to trigger undefined behavior, bypass security checks, or cause state inconsistencies in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 32-56] [Missing Security Tags] Does the ApiTags enum lack security-critical categories like 'Privileged', 'SystemOnly', or 'ValidatorOnly', making it difficult to enforce role-based access control across API endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 16] [Failpoint Module] Does the 'failpoint' module (line 16) expose debugging/testing hooks in production that could be exploited to inject faults, bypass logic, or cause deterministic failures for attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 23] [Failpoint Setter] Does the 'set_failpoints' module (line 23) provide production-accessible APIs to inject failures, potentially allowing attackers to trigger error paths, bypass consensus checks, or cause validator misbehavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 19] [Metrics Exposure] Is the public 'metrics' module (line 19) properly secured, or could it expose sensitive internal metrics (validator performance, transaction pool state, gas prices) that aid in timing attacks or consensus manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 24] [Spec Endpoint] Does the public 'spec' module (line 24) expose OpenAPI specifications that leak implementation details, internal endpoint structures, or parameter validation logic useful for crafting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 8-28] [Module Coupling] Are security boundaries between modules (accounts, transactions, state, blocks) properly enforced, or can one module's compromised endpoint access another module's privileged functions through shared Context? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 13] [Context Sharing] Since 'context' is public (line 13), can external callers create malicious Context instances with tampered database readers, mempool senders, or node configs to bypass transaction validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 8, 25, 28] [State Access] Do the 'accounts', 'state', and 'transactions' modules properly validate cross-module state access through shared Context, or can one module's query bypass another's access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-29] [Missing Auth Module] Is there a missing 'authentication' or 'authorization' module in the module list (lines 7-29), indicating that auth logic is scattered across modules rather than centralized, making it vulnerable to bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-29] [Missing Rate Limit] Is there a missing 'rate_limiting' module, suggesting endpoints lack per-client rate limits, enabling API abuse, resource exhaustion, or targeted denial of service against validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-29] [Missing CORS Module] Is there a missing 'cors' or 'security_headers' module, indicating potential Cross-Origin vulnerabilities or missing security headers (CSP, HSTS) in API responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 22, 62] [Runtime Functions] Can the exported 'bootstrap' function (line 62, defined in runtime line 22) be called multiple times to spawn duplicate API servers, causing port conflicts, resource exhaustion, or split-brain scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 62] [API Service Exposure] Does 'get_api_service' (line 62) allow external callers to extract the OpenApiService and manipulate route handlers, middleware, or endpoint logic after service initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 62] [Attach Poem] Can 'attach_poem_to_runtime' (line 62) be exploited to attach malicious middleware, replace error handlers, or inject logging that captures sensitive transaction data before encryption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 5] [poem_openapi Dependency] Is the poem_openapi::Tags trait (line 5) from a trusted source, or could a supply chain attack on the poem crate inject malicious code into all API endpoint definitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-29] [Module Dependency Order] Does the module declaration order (lines 7-29) matter for initialization, and could reordering cause security checks to be skipped or race conditions during API server startup? (Low)"
