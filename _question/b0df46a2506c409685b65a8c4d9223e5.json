  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Integration] [BCS compatibility] Does the BCS serialization format at line 112-114 match what the rest of Aptos expects for WebAuthn authenticators? Could format mismatches cause verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Integration] [Gas metering] Is WebAuthn verification properly gas-metered? Could attackers submit expensive WebAuthn verification transactions to DoS validators without paying sufficient gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Empty vectors] What happens if authenticator_data at line 90 is empty Vec? Does generate_verification_data() still work correctly, or could empty data bypass authenticator validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Empty client_data_json] What happens if client_data_json at line 95 is empty Vec? Does JSON parsing at line 139 fail gracefully, or could empty JSON bypass challenge validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Very large vectors] What happens if authenticator_data or client_data_json are near Vec maximum size (isize::MAX bytes)? Could this cause integer overflow in length calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Challenge length mismatch] What if challenge_bytes decoded at line 141/180 are not exactly 32 bytes (expected SHA3-256 output)? Does comparison at line 184-188 handle length mismatch securely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Null bytes in JSON] Can attacker include null bytes (\\\\x00) in client_data_json causing JSON parser at line 139/179 to truncate or misparse data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Unicode in JSON] Can attacker use unicode escapes or special characters in CollectedClientData fields to bypass validation or cause JSON parsing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum signature size] What if AssertionSignature serializes to exactly MAX_WEBAUTHN_SIGNATURE_BYTES (1024)? Is this accepted or rejected? Off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Fuzzing] [Arbitrary implementation] The fuzzing arbitrary implementation at line 61-72 only generates AssertionSignature - are PartialAuthenticatorAssertionResponse fields also fuzzed? Missing fuzzing could leave vulnerabilities undiscovered. (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Fuzzing] [from_bytes_unchecked risk] The fuzzer uses from_bytes_unchecked() at line 67 - could this mask vulnerabilities where production code using from_bytes() would catch invalid signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/webauthn.rs] [Fuzzing] [Edge case coverage] Does fuzzing test empty authenticator_data/client_data_json, extremely large data, malformed JSON, invalid base64, etc.? Missing edge case fuzzing could miss critical bugs. (Medium)",
