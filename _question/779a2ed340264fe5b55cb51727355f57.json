  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [wall_time_measurement()] [Timing side channels] Could the wall-time measurement leak information about account balances or transaction patterns through timing variations, enabling privacy attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Optimization bugs] Could compiler optimizations in benchmark mode eliminate security-critical checks that exist in production builds, making vulnerabilities invisible during benchmarking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [iter_batched] [State reuse] Does iter_batched properly reset TransactionBenchState between iterations, or could state pollution from previous runs affect benchmark results and mask stateful bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Missing failure paths] Does the benchmark only test successful P2P transfers, ignoring failure scenarios (insufficient gas, invalid recipient, etc.) that could have security implications in error handling code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [TransactionBencher::new()] [Strategy configuration] Can attackers exploit the proptest strategy parameters any_with::<P2PTransferGen>((1_000, 1_000_000)) to generate transactions that appear valid in tests but violate production invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Executor configuration] Does the benchmark use the same BlockExecutorConfig as production (concurrency levels, gas limits, partitioning), or could configuration mismatches hide real-world vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [criterion_group! macro] [Target selection] Does benchmarking only peer_to_peer transactions provide sufficient coverage, or could attacks through other transaction types (script functions, module publishing) bypass tested code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Account universe] Does the AccountPickStyle::Unlimited in TransactionBencher allow unrealistic transaction patterns that don't test account locking mechanisms used in production to prevent race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Malicious input] Does the benchmark test P2P transfers with maximum-length memo fields or other optional parameters that could trigger buffer overflows or excessive memory allocation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Type confusion] Can the benchmark detect if P2P transfers are executed with incorrect coin types (FA vs APT) that could allow unauthorized minting or type confusion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Reentrancy] Does the benchmark test scenarios where P2P transfer callbacks could trigger reentrancy, potentially allowing recursive transfers that drain accounts beyond their balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [TransactionBencher] [Block metadata] Does TransactionBenchState::gen_transaction() include realistic block metadata with proper timestamp/epoch progression, or could timestamp manipulation vulnerabilities go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Validator set changes] Does the benchmark test P2P transactions across epoch boundaries where validator set changes occur, potentially exposing state inconsistencies during reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Storage backend] Does the benchmark use InMemoryStateStore which may have different performance/correctness characteristics than production RocksDB, masking storage-related race conditions or corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/benches/transaction_benches.rs] [Function: peer_to_peer()] [Error propagation] Does the benchmark verify that transaction execution errors (abort codes, out-of-gas) are correctly propagated and don't silently corrupt state, potentially hiding fund loss vulnerabilities? (High)"
