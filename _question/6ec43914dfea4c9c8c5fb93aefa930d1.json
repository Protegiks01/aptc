(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Logic Error - Line 10] Does the uppercase check at line 10 correctly handle all Unicode uppercase characters, or can attackers use non-ASCII uppercase letters to bypass underscore insertion and create name collisions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [State Machine Bug - Line 8-14] The 'first' flag (line 8) is set to false only on line 14 - can consecutive uppercase letters at the start cause incorrect conversion, leading to hasher name mismatches across different type definitions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Unicode Exploitation - Line 12] The to_lowercase() call at line 12 may expand single characters into multiple characters for some Unicode code points - can this cause buffer overflows or unexpected hasher name lengths that break crypto assumptions?

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [All Lowercase] For already lowercase inputs like 'mytype', does the function simply return the same string, and could this lead to identical hasher names for 'mytype' and 'MyType' after processing?
