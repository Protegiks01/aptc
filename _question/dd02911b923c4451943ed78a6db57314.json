  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Input validation] Can an attacker insert a ProcessorStatusV2 record with an empty or excessively long processor name string, potentially causing database constraint violations or storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [SQL injection] Does the processor field (String) properly sanitize input before database insertion, or can an attacker inject SQL commands through crafted processor names to manipulate database queries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Integer overflow] Can the last_success_version (i64) field overflow when processing transactions near i64::MAX, potentially causing version number wraparound and breaking indexer state tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Integer underflow] Is there validation preventing negative values for last_success_version, or can an attacker set negative version numbers to cause indexer reprocessing of old transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Type confusion] Can type conversion errors occur when casting u64 blockchain versions to i64 database versions, potentially losing the most significant bit and causing incorrect version tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Processor impersonation] Are there access controls preventing one processor from updating another processor's status by crafting a malicious processor name matching a critical system processor? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [Unicode attack] Can Unicode normalization issues in the processor String field allow an attacker to create duplicate processor entries that appear identical but have different byte representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2] [NULL byte injection] Does the processor String field properly handle NULL bytes or other special characters that could truncate strings or cause database parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2Query] [Timestamp manipulation] Can the last_updated timestamp (chrono::NaiveDateTime) be manipulated to spoof when a processor last updated, potentially hiding indexer failures or stalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2Query] [Time zone confusion] Does the use of NaiveDateTime (no timezone) cause issues when comparing timestamps across different systems or timezones, potentially causing version synchronization issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2Query] [Data race] Are there race conditions when multiple threads query ProcessorStatusV2Query simultaneously while another thread updates the status, potentially reading inconsistent partial state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Struct: ProcessorStatusV2Query] [Stale data] Can the query return stale cached data instead of the latest processor status, causing indexers to skip versions or reprocess already-processed transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Function: get_by_processor()] [SQL injection] Does the filter(processor_status::processor.eq(processor_name)) properly parameterize the query, or can special characters in processor_name inject arbitrary SQL? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Function: get_by_processor()] [Database connection exhaustion] If multiple concurrent calls to get_by_processor() occur with invalid processor names, can this exhaust database connections and cause denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Function: get_by_processor()] [Error information leak] Does the QueryResult error expose sensitive database information like table structure, connection strings, or internal paths that could aid attackers? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Function: get_by_processor()] [Missing validation] Does get_by_processor() validate that processor_name is non-empty before querying, or can empty strings cause unexpected database behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Function: get_by_processor()] [Query performance] Can an attacker craft pathological processor names that cause slow database queries, enabling DoS attacks on the indexer query endpoint? (Low)",
