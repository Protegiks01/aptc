  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Event subscription bypass] Can a malicious actor manipulate the EventSubscriptionService initialization to subscribe to privileged events without proper authorization, potentially intercepting reconfiguration events meant for consensus validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Race condition] Is there a race condition where multiple components could simultaneously subscribe to reconfigurations before the service is fully initialized, leading to duplicate or missed reconfiguration notifications that could cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Database clone vulnerability] Does the Arc<RwLock<db_rw.clone()>> pattern expose the database reader/writer to concurrent modification attacks where malicious code could corrupt the underlying database handle during event processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Subscription injection] Can an attacker inject malicious event subscriptions during the service creation phase to intercept DKG events ('0x1::dkg::DKGStartEvent') and manipulate distributed key generation ceremonies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [JWK consensus manipulation] Can the JWK consensus subscription to '0x1::jwks::ObservedJWKsUpdated' events be exploited to inject fake JWK update notifications, allowing attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Role validation bypass] Does the function properly validate node_config.base.role.is_validator() before creating validator-only subscriptions, or can a non-validator node trick the system into receiving consensus events by manipulating the role configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Subscription exhaustion] Can an attacker cause the subscribe_to_reconfigurations() or subscribe_to_events() calls to fail with expect() panics by exhausting subscription resources, causing node crashes and network-wide liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Event type spoofing] Are the event type strings like '0x1::dkg::DKGStartEvent' and '0x1::jwks::ObservedJWKsUpdated' validated against a whitelist, or can an attacker register subscriptions to malicious event types that trigger unintended behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Consensus observer attack] If consensus_observer.observer_enabled is manipulated in the config, can a malicious observer node receive reconfiguration events it shouldn't have access to, potentially front-running validator set changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Multiple subscription conflict] Can the function create multiple conflicting subscriptions (mempool, consensus_observer, consensus, DKG, JWK) that process the same reconfiguration event differently, leading to state inconsistencies across components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [RwLock deadlock] Does the RwLock wrapper around db_rw introduce deadlock scenarios where event processing blocks waiting for database locks while initialization is still holding locks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: create_event_subscription_service()] [Empty vector vulnerability] The subscribe_to_events() call uses empty vectors for the first parameter - can this be exploited to subscribe to ALL events instead of just the specified types, causing information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Waypoint manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious Waypoint value that bypasses state sync validation, allowing the node to sync to a forked or invalid chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Initialization ordering attack] Is there a specific initialization order dependency where setting up data client before storage service could allow race conditions where network requests are processed before storage is ready? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Notification channel overflow] Can the max_pending_mempool_notifications buffer be exhausted by malicious actors flooding the mempool notifier, causing legitimate notifications to be dropped and breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Consensus notification timeout] Does the commit_notification_timeout_ms configuration allow an attacker to set an extremely low timeout value causing consensus to timeout prematurely and halt block production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [ChunkExecutor DoS] Can the Arc<ChunkExecutor> be cloned and shared in an unsafe way that allows concurrent execution of chunks, potentially causing race conditions in block execution and state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Metadata storage manipulation] Can the PersistentMetadataStorage created from node_config.storage.dir() be manipulated by providing a malicious directory path, allowing attackers to corrupt or replace state sync metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Network client hijacking] Does the network_client.get_peers_and_metadata() expose peer information that could be manipulated before being passed to setup functions, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Function: start_state_sync_and_get_notification_handles()] [Multiple runtime spawning] Can spawning multiple runtimes (aptos_data_client_runtime, streaming_service_runtime, storage_service_runtime) without proper isolation allow one compromised runtime to affect others?
