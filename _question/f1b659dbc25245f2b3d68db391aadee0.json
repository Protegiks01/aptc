(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/move-ir-to-bytecode/syntax/src/lib.rs] [Grammar: TransactionScript lines 193-196] [Script validation] Must the main procedure be 'public' and have 'ground type' parameters - can these restrictions be bypassed to create scripts that accept resource parameters and steal funds? (Critical)",
