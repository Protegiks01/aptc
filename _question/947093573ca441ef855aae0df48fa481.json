  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Return Value Validation] Does the caller of generate_key_objects() validate that all four returned values (validator_blob, vfn_blob, private_identity, public_identity) are consistent with each other, or can internal bugs cause mismatched identities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateIdentity] [File Permissions] When PrivateIdentity is serialized to disk, are file permissions properly restricted to prevent unauthorized access to validator private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PublicIdentity] [Public Key Distribution] When PublicIdentity is distributed to other validators during genesis, is the distribution channel authenticated, or can an attacker perform MITM attacks to substitute malicious public keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Key Backup Security] If validators back up their PrivateIdentity, does the backup process maintain the same security guarantees, or can backup files leak keys through insecure storage or transmission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateIdentity] [Key Rotation Compatibility] Since PrivateIdentity contains all validator keys, does the structure support key rotation, or would rotating any key require regenerating all keys and potentially breaking validator identity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Multi-Validator Genesis] When generate_key_objects() is called for multiple validators in sequence, does the function properly maintain KeyGen state isolation, or can state pollution cause key correlation across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Ed25519 Implementation] Does the Ed25519 key generation at line 39 use a cryptographically secure implementation (e.g., RFC 8032 compliant), or could implementation flaws introduce bias or weak keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [BLS12-381 Parameter Security] Does the BLS12-381 key generation at line 40 use the correct curve parameters and secure implementation, or could parameter confusion or implementation bugs compromise consensus signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [X25519 Clamping] Do the X25519 key generations at lines 41-42 properly clamp private keys according to RFC 7748, or could unclamped keys introduce vulnerabilities in the ECDH key exchange? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Public Key Derivation] Are the public key derivations at lines 70-76 performed using constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks, or could an observer learn information about private keys through timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [PoP Algorithm Selection] Does the ProofOfPossession::create() at line 72-74 use a standardized and secure algorithm (e.g., BLS signature over the public key), or could a weak PoP scheme allow key substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Import: aptos-crypto] [Cryptographic Library Vulnerabilities] Does the aptos_crypto library imported at line 5 implement cryptographic primitives correctly, or could bugs in Ed25519, BLS12-381, or X25519 implementations compromise all generated keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Import: aptos-keygen] [KeyGen Security] Does the KeyGen struct from aptos_keygen at line 10 properly implement CSPRNG seeding and state management, or could predictable random number generation compromise all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Import: aptos-types] [AuthenticationKey Derivation] Does the AuthenticationKey::ed25519() function from aptos_types at line 44 correctly implement the address derivation standard, or could implementation bugs allow address collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Import: aptos-config] [ConfigKey Security] Does the ConfigKey wrapper from aptos_config at line 4 provide any additional security features (zeroization, access control), or is it just a plain wrapper that could leak keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PublicIdentity] [Consensus Key Substitution] After genesis, can a validator substitute their consensus_public_key in PublicIdentity with a different key during reconfiguration to break BLS signature aggregation or cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateIdentity] [Validator Network Key Misuse] Can the validator_network_private_key at line 21 be accidentally used for non-validator network connections, weakening the validator network security boundary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [VFN Identity Spoofing] Can an attacker who obtains a vfn_blob claim to be the associated validator by leveraging the matching account_address at line 54, even without consensus or account keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PublicIdentity] [Network Key Reuse] If a validator rotates their keys, can the old validator_network_public_key at line 32 be reused by another entity, causing network authentication confusion or replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateIdentity] [Key Export Controls] Does the PrivateIdentity structure support secure key export for backup purposes with proper encryption, or must keys be exported in plaintext creating operational security risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Audit Trail] Does generate_key_objects() log key generation events for audit purposes without leaking key material, or is key generation completely silent making forensics after a compromise difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateIdentity] [Hardware Security Module Support] Can PrivateIdentity be integrated with HSMs to store private keys, or does the current structure require keys to be stored in software, reducing security for high-value validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/keys.rs] [Function: generate_key_objects()] [Deterministic Genesis] Does generate_key_objects() support deterministic key derivation for testing/recovery purposes, and if so, are test keys properly separated from production keys to prevent accidental mainnet use?
