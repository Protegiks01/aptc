  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Edge case] [Counter overflow recovery] If the AtomicU64 counter overflows at u64::MAX, is there recovery logic, or does the pipeline become permanently stuck unable to increment further? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Edge case] [Processor state after error] If process() encounters an error, does the processor instance remain in a valid state for subsequent requests, or can errors cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [DoS] [Slow process() attack] Can a Byzantine validator or malicious transaction cause process() to take arbitrarily long at line 100, blocking all subsequent pipeline processing and halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [DoS] [Guard accumulation] Can an attacker create CountedRequests without processing them, causing guards to accumulate and the counter to stay elevated indefinitely, blocking cleanup? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Cross-phase] [Execution -> Signing bypass] Can a malicious execution phase send fake ExecutionResponse to the signing phase, bypassing actual execution and allowing unexecuted blocks to be signed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Cross-phase] [Signing -> Persisting bypass] Can crafted SigningResponse messages skip validation in the persisting phase, allowing unsigned blocks to be persisted to storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Cross-phase] [Phase isolation] Are responses properly authenticated between phases, or can an external attacker inject malicious responses into the tx channel to corrupt consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Cross-phase] [State synchronization] If different phases have inconsistent views of reset_flag due to memory ordering, can this cause some phases to reset while others continue, breaking pipeline atomicity? (High)",
