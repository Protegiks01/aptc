  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [BCS Attacks] [Integer Encoding Ambiguity] BCS encodes integers in little-endian - can mixed endianness between encode/decode cause version or metadata fields to be misinterpreted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [BCS Attacks] [Bytes Allocation] When BCS deserializes large byte arrays in StateValue.data, can integer overflow in size calculation cause undersized allocation and buffer overflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Key Size Limits] Does RocksDB enforce maximum key size limits, and if encode_key() produces keys exceeding this limit, does the write fail gracefully or corrupt the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Value Size Limits] Can encode_value() produce values larger than RocksDB's maximum value size, and if so, does the failure get detected before committing state, or can it cause partial batch writes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Write Batch Atomicity] When multiple state values are written in a batch, does RocksDB guarantee all-or-nothing atomicity, or can partial failures leave some keys updated and others not? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Compaction Interference] Can RocksDB compaction operations interfere with ongoing encode/decode operations, causing reads to return compacted-away versions or corrupt data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Column Family Deletion] If the STATE_VALUE_CF_NAME column family is accidentally deleted, can the schema handle missing CF errors gracefully, or will validators panic and halt? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Snapshot Isolation] Does RocksDB snapshot isolation guarantee that iterators see consistent state even as new versions are written, or can concurrent writes cause iterator anomalies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [RocksDB Integration] [Disk Corruption] If disk corruption flips bits in stored keys or values, can decode_key()/decode_value() detect corruption through checksums, or will they return corrupted data as valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Consensus Safety] [State Root Divergence] If two validators encode the same StateValue differently (due to non-determinism), will they compute different Merkle roots and fail to reach consensus, causing a permanent chain split? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Historical State Verification] Can an attacker exploit version encoding to make validators query wrong historical state during block verification, causing them to accept invalid blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Epoch Boundary] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can inconsistencies in encode/decode operations cause new validators to initialize with different state than old validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay old state values at newer versions by manipulating encoded keys, causing validators to revert to old state and enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Vote Manipulation] If state values used for validator voting power are corrupted during encode/decode, can this cause incorrect vote weight calculation and break AptosBFT safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Move VM Integration] [Resource Materialization] When Move VM reads a resource via this schema, can decode_value() return corrupted Move values that bypass type safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Move VM Integration] [Module Code Integrity] Move modules are stored as StateValues - can encoding/decoding corruption modify bytecode instructions, allowing execution of malicious code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Move VM Integration] [Table Item Access] Move tables use TableItem StateKeys - can key encoding issues cause table reads to return wrong items or cross-contaminate between tables? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Move VM Integration] [Resource Group Confusion] Move resource groups use special StateKey encoding - can this schema distinguish resource group items from regular resources, or can confusion allow unauthorized resource access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Move VM Integration] [Delayed Field Expansion] If StateValue contains unexpanded delayed fields (aggregators), does decode_value() handle them correctly, or can partial expansion cause Move execution errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Write Set Encoding] Transaction write sets contain StateValue changes - can encode_value() produce inconsistent encodings for the same changes, causing write set verification to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Read-Your-Writes] During transaction execution, can timing issues cause encode/decode operations to see stale state instead of previous writes in the same transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Parallel Execution Conflicts] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent transactions encode conflicting StateValues for the same key, causing non-deterministic transaction ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Prologue/Epilogue State] Transaction prologue/epilogue modify system state - can schema-level issues cause these modifications to be applied incorrectly, breaking gas charging or sequence number updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Abort Handling] If a transaction aborts mid-execution, are StateValue changes from encode_value() properly rolled back, or can partial state updates persist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Gas Metering] [Storage Cost Calculation] Gas charges are based on StateValue size - can encode_value() produce different byte lengths for the same logical value, causing gas calculation inconsistencies? (High)"
