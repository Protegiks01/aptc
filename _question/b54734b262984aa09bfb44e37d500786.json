  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Version Monotonicity] Does the code enforce that ledger_version >= oldest_ledger_version, or could a malicious node violate this invariant to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_version()] [Version Existence] Does requesting a specific version at line 36 guarantee the transaction exists, or could a node return a placeholder transaction for non-existent versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Version Regression] Between the first and second API calls at lines 94-98 and 115-119, could the baseline node's ledger_version decrease, indicating a chain reorganization that should fail validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Version Overflow Wrap] If latest_shared_version wraps around to 0 due to overflow, would the middle_shared_version calculation at line 167 still produce a valid result? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Historical Validation] Does only validating middle_shared_version provide sufficient confidence, or could a malicious node have diverged at other versions within the shared window? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Sync Window] Could a malicious target node intentionally maintain a specific synchronization lag that keeps it within the valid version window but allows it to avoid validation of recent problematic transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Fast Forward Attack] Can a malicious node artificially inflate its reported latest_ledger_version to force the checker to select a very recent middle_shared_version where the baseline hasn't fully committed the transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Slow Catchup] Could a target node deliberately synchronize very slowly to ensure it's always validated against old transactions where it knows it has correct state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Epoch Boundary] If middle_shared_version falls on an epoch boundary transaction, could differences in epoch handling between nodes cause false validation failures or passes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Checkpoint Exploitation] Does the checker consider checkpoints or snapshots, or could a node load state from a checkpoint while claiming to have executed all intervening transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: check()] [Checker DoS] Could an attacker repeatedly trigger the error paths at lines 102-110 and 122-131 to cause excessive error logging or resource consumption in the checker? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/transaction_correctness.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_version()] [API DoS] Could repeatedly calling get_transaction_by_version with malicious parameters cause DoS on the API endpoints of baseline or target nodes? (Low)"
