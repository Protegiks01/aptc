  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Resource] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft a malicious API response with a valid StructTag in resource_type but inject arbitrary malicious code or exploit payloads in the unvalidated serde_json::Value data field, potentially causing deserialization attacks when the data is later processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Resource] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the Resource struct impose any size limits on the serde_json::Value data field, or can an attacker send extremely large JSON payloads that exhaust memory when deserializing resources, causing denial of service on validator nodes or API servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Resource] [State Inconsistency] Can an attacker provide a StructTag that passes deserialize_resource_type validation but contains mismatched type information compared to the actual data field, leading to type confusion when the resource is used in Move VM execution or state queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Resource] [JSON Injection] Does the data field's serde_json::Value allow nested JSON objects with arbitrary depth, enabling attackers to craft deeply nested structures that cause stack overflow during recursive parsing or processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Resource] [Validation Bypass] Can the resource_type StructTag be manipulated to reference system-only resources (like 0x1::coin::CoinStore) that should not be accessible through the REST API, potentially exposing sensitive state or enabling unauthorized resource manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Input Validation] Does the function properly validate hex string length before parsing, or can an attacker provide extremely long hex strings (e.g., millions of characters) that cause excessive memory allocation and CPU consumption during FromStr::parse()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Integer Overflow] When deserializing u64 values like sequence numbers through this function, can an attacker provide hex strings representing values exceeding u64::MAX, potentially causing integer overflow or wraparound that breaks sequence number validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Authentication Bypass] Can the trim_start_matches('0x') logic be exploited by providing malformed prefixes like '0X' (uppercase) or multiple '0x0x' prefixes that pass through validation but cause incorrect parsing of authentication keys or addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Error Handling] Does the D::Error::custom error path properly sanitize the error message from FromStr::Err, or can attackers inject specially crafted hex strings that leak sensitive information through verbose error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Parsing Ambiguity] Can an attacker provide hex strings with mixed case (e.g., '0xAbCdEf') that are interpreted differently by FromStr::parse() versus the on-chain representation, causing state inconsistencies between REST API queries and actual blockchain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Type Safety] Since this is a generic function accepting any type T implementing FromStr, can an attacker exploit weak FromStr implementations in imported types to bypass validation, such as parsing invalid authentication keys that should be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Character Encoding] Does the function handle Unicode or special characters in hex strings correctly, or can attackers use UTF-8 encoding tricks (like zero-width spaces) to create visually identical but cryptographically different values that bypass deduplication checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Whitespace Handling] The function only trims '0x' prefix but not surrounding whitespace - can an attacker inject leading/trailing spaces or newlines that cause parse() to fail silently or be interpreted differently in subsequent processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Parser Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious StructTag strings with special characters or escape sequences that exploit vulnerabilities in parse_struct_tag(), potentially causing buffer overflows or code injection in the Move type parser? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Type System Bypass] Does parse_struct_tag() validate that the parsed StructTag corresponds to an actual deployed Move module, or can attackers reference non-existent types that cause undefined behavior when the resource is accessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Generic Type Confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the generic type parameters in StructTag (e.g., 'CoinStore<FakeCoin>') to bypass type safety checks and access resources with incompatible types, potentially enabling unauthorized fund transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Module Address Spoofing] Does the function validate that the module address in the StructTag (e.g., '0x1::coin::CoinStore') matches expected system addresses, or can attackers spoof system module addresses to make malicious contracts appear as trusted framework code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Nested Generic Explosion] Can an attacker provide deeply nested generic types (e.g., 'Type<Type<Type<...>>>') that cause exponential memory growth or stack overflow during parsing, leading to validator node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Canonical Form Bypass] Does parse_struct_tag() enforce canonical formatting of type parameters, or can attackers use alternative representations (e.g., extra spaces, different ordering) to bypass resource access control lists or caching mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_resource_type] [Error Message Leakage] When parse_struct_tag() fails, does the D::Error::custom error reveal internal type system information or module deployment details that attackers could use for reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Authentication Key Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malformed authentication_key that passes deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string validation but doesn't match the expected 32-byte format, potentially allowing transaction submission with invalid keys that bypass signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Sequence Number Overflow] When deserializing sequence_number through deserialize_from_string, can an attacker provide u64::MAX or values near the maximum, causing integer overflow in subsequent sequence number increments that breaks replay protection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Sequence Number Rollback] Does the Account struct validate that the deserialized sequence_number matches on-chain state, or can attackers provide stale sequence numbers from API responses that enable transaction replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Key Derivation Attack] Can the authentication_key field be manipulated to create collisions with other accounts' keys, potentially enabling unauthorized access to funds or resources belonging to different users? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [State Desynchronization] If an attacker rapidly submits transactions while querying account state through the REST API, can race conditions in Account deserialization cause the client to use outdated sequence numbers that result in transaction failures or financial loss? (Medium)"
