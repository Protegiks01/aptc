  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: FileStoreMetadata] [Data Integrity] Can an attacker with cloud storage write access manipulate the chain_id field to cause indexers to process transactions from different chains, potentially leading to state corruption or cross-chain replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: FileStoreMetadata] [Integer Overflow] Can the version field overflow when approaching u64::MAX, and if so, does this cause version tracking to wrap around to 0, potentially allowing reprocessing of old transactions or creation of duplicate blobs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: FileStoreMetadata] [Missing Validation] Does FileStoreMetadata lack any integrity checks (checksums, signatures, or cryptographic proofs) that would allow an attacker to forge metadata and redirect indexers to process malicious transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: FileStoreMetadata] [Type Safety] Are there any validation constraints on chain_id and version fields, or can they be set to invalid values (e.g., chain_id=0, version=u64::MAX) that could cause logic errors in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Panic on Error] The function uses .expect() on line 27 which will panic if the download fails - can an attacker cause denial of service by manipulating cloud storage permissions or bucket configuration to trigger repeated crashes of indexer services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [JSON Deserialization] The function uses serde_json::from_slice() with .expect() on line 29 - can an attacker inject malformed JSON into the metadata file to crash all indexer instances attempting to read it, causing network-wide indexer unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to get_file_store_metadata() during metadata updates result in reading partially written or inconsistent metadata, causing indexers to process transactions with incorrect chain_id or version information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where metadata is validated after download but modified before use, allowing an attacker to swap in malicious metadata between validation and processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Missing Authentication] Does the Object::download() call verify bucket ownership or implement authentication, or can an attacker gain read access to potentially sensitive metadata by exploiting misconfigured GCS bucket permissions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Data Tampering] Can an attacker with read-write access to the GCS bucket replace the metadata file with a crafted version containing arbitrary chain_id and version values to cause indexers to skip processing critical transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker upload an extremely large metadata file (GB+ in size) that causes memory exhaustion when downloaded via Object::download(), leading to indexer crashes and denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_file_store_metadata()] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker craft a malicious JSON payload with deeply nested structures or exponential expansion patterns that cause CPU/memory exhaustion during serde_json::from_slice() deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Panic on Error] The function uses .unwrap() on lines 37 and 42 which will panic on failures - can an attacker cause indexer crashes by manipulating cloud storage to trigger upload failures during metadata updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to upload_file_store_metadata() from multiple indexer instances cause race conditions where metadata updates are lost or overwritten, leading to version tracking inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Non-Atomic Update] Does the Object::create() operation guarantee atomic writes, or can partial writes occur during network failures, leaving corrupted metadata that crashes all indexers on next read? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Version Rollback] Can an attacker with write access upload metadata with a lower version number than the current version, causing indexers to reprocess already-processed transactions and potentially create duplicate entries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Chain ID Mutation] Can an attacker upload metadata with a different chain_id mid-operation, causing indexers to suddenly switch to processing transactions from a different blockchain without proper validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Missing Validation] Does upload_file_store_metadata() validate that the new version is greater than the current version before uploading, or can versions decrease causing transaction reprocessing or skipping? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [JSON Serialization] Can specially crafted FileStoreMetadata with extreme values cause serde_json::to_vec() to fail or produce invalid JSON on line 37, leading to .unwrap() panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: upload_file_store_metadata()] [Access Control] Does the function verify caller permissions before allowing metadata updates, or can any component with cloud storage credentials arbitrarily modify metadata and disrupt indexer consensus?
