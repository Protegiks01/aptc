  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Function: TransactionScriptABI::new()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker create a TransactionScriptABI with an empty name string, causing validation failures or crashes in downstream VM execution when the script is invoked, potentially leading to consensus divergence if validators handle empty names differently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Function: TransactionScriptABI::new()] [Bytecode injection] Does the constructor validate the code parameter, or can an attacker inject malicious bytecode that violates Move VM invariants, potentially causing arbitrary code execution, resource exhaustion, or validator crashes when the bytecode is later executed?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Function: ScriptFunctionABI::new()] [Cross-module confusion] Does the constructor validate that the name corresponds to an actual function in module_name, or can attackers reference non-existent functions, causing runtime errors that may be handled inconsistently across validators?
