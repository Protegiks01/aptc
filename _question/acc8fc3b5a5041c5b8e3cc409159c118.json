  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_timestamp()] [Panic Attack Vector] The function uses unwrap_or_else with panic! - can an attacker send malformed timestamps that always trigger panic, causing repeated service crashes and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_timestamp()] [Invalid Nanos Range] Does the function validate that ts.nanos is within the valid range (0-999999999) before casting to u32, or can out-of-range values cause from_timestamp_opt to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_timestamp()] [Deprecated API Usage] The function uses deprecated from_timestamp_opt - are there known security issues with this deprecated API that should be addressed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_timestamp()] [Version Parameter Unused] The version parameter is only used in panic message - can this lead to confusion or incorrect error handling in calling code that expects version to affect parsing behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Integer Overflow] When calculating current_size + transaction.encoded_len(), can integer overflow occur with very large transactions causing incorrect chunk_size comparisons and memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker send a single transaction larger than available memory, which will be placed in its own chunk, causing OOM when the chunk is processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Chunk Size Bypass] The comment says 'If a single transaction is larger than chunk_size, it will be put into a chunk by itself' - can this be exploited to bypass chunk size limits and cause downstream systems to fail when processing oversized chunks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Empty Input Handling] When transactions vector is empty, does the function return an empty vector or could there be edge case behavior that affects calling code assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Chunk Ordering] Does the chunking algorithm preserve transaction ordering guarantees required for consensus, or can chunk boundaries cause reordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [encoded_len() Accuracy] Can the transaction.encoded_len() estimation be inaccurate (underestimate actual size) causing chunks to exceed chunk_size when actually encoded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Zero chunk_size] What happens if chunk_size is 0? Will every transaction get its own chunk, potentially causing resource exhaustion with millions of tiny chunks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: chunk_transactions()] [Chunk Count Explosion] For very small chunk_size values and many transactions, can the number of chunks grow unbounded causing memory exhaustion in the returned Vec<Vec<Transaction>>?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Type: GrpcClientType] [Type Safety] Does the type alias for FullnodeDataClient hide important type information that could lead to incorrect usage or unsafe casts in consuming code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Type: GrpcDataServiceClientType] [Type Safety] Can the RawDataClient type alias be confused with GrpcClientType leading to incorrect function calls or data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: default_file_storage_format()] [Backward Compatibility] The default StorageFormat is JsonBase64UncompressedProto for backward compatibility - can mixing old and new formats cause data corruption or parsing failures?
