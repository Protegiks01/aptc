  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 30, 81] [Weak RNG] Does the use of TEST_SEED with StdRng::from_seed() create deterministic, predictable key material in benchmarks that could leak into production if this code pattern is copied, allowing attackers to predict private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 31-35, 82-84] [Key Reuse] Are the x25519 private keys generated in benchmarks properly isolated from production systems, or could benchmark key material accidentally leak into production validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 41-45] [Key Material in Closures] Does the benchmark closure at lines 40-71 properly clear sensitive key material from memory, or could repeated benchmark runs leak key bytes through memory not being zeroed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 31-35] [Key Serialization] Could the to_bytes() and try_from() pattern for key serialization expose timing information or improper error handling that leaks key material bits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 37-38] [Buffer Sizing] Are the fixed-size buffers (handshake_init_msg_len(0)) properly validated against MAX_SIZE_NOISE_MSG, or could incorrect size calculations cause buffer overflows in the underlying implementation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Line: 78] [Buffer Allocation] Does the buffer_msg allocation of MSG_SIZE * 2 (8192 bytes) properly handle the authentication tag length, or could off-by-one errors cause memory corruption during encryption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Line: 121] [Buffer Slicing] Could the buffer slicing operations buffer_msg[MSG_SIZE..MSG_SIZE + AES_GCM_TAGLEN] cause panics or undefined behavior if AES_GCM_TAGLEN is miscalculated? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 49-56] [Prologue Validation] Does the hardcoded prologue b'prologue' match production usage, or could mismatches between benchmark and production prologue values cause authentication bypass vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 54, 64] [Payload Handling] Are None payloads handled identically to empty payloads in the handshake, or could this difference cause authentication bypass if production code makes different assumptions? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 68-70] [Initiator Finalization] Could the finalize_connection() call accept tampered second_message data, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks if signature verification is weak? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 5-8] [AES-NI Requirements] Does the code enforce AES-NI CPU features in production, or could fallback to software AES create timing attack vulnerabilities that benchmarks with hardware AES wouldn't detect? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/benches/noise.rs] [Lines: 40-71] [Repeated Operations] Could repeatedly running the same handshake with the same keys in benchmarks expose patterns that enable key recovery through differential analysis? (Low)",
