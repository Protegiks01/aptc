  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::from_type_tag()] [Function tag handling] Handles FunctionTag with args, results, abilities. Can attacker provide mismatched abilities for function type that violate closure capture rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::from_signature_token()] [TypeParameter handling] SignatureToken::TypeParameter uses raw index. Can out-of-bounds index access wrong type parameter or cause panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: Type] [Struct(ModuleId, StructId, Vec<Type>)] No validation that vec length matches struct arity. Can attacker provide wrong number of type arguments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_variant_struct()] [Variant detection] Checks if struct has variants. Can non-variant structs be confused with variant structs due to caching issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_struct_or_vector_of_struct()] [Recursive struct check] Recursively checks vectors. Can deeply nested vector<vector<...>> cause stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::get_all_contained_types_with_skip_reference()] [Variant field iteration] Iterates variant fields for variant structs. Can attacker cause DoS by creating struct with many variants each with many fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_number()] [Number type check] Includes spec-only Num type. Can Num type leak into implementation causing undefined arithmetic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_signed_int()] [Signed integer check] Pattern matches on i8-i256. Can signed integer operations overflow at boundaries without checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_unsigned_int()] [Unsigned integer check] Pattern matches on u8-u256. Can unsigned wrap-around be exploited in arithmetic? (Medium)"
