  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Classification] Can an attacker exploit misclassification of errors to bypass rate limiting by triggering errors that should be InvalidRequest but are instead classified as UnexpectedErrorEncountered, avoiding increment of invalid request counts? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Information Leakage] Do the error messages in InvalidRequest, StorageErrorEncountered, TooManyInvalidRequests, and UnexpectedErrorEncountered leak sensitive internal state information (database paths, memory addresses, internal version numbers) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Wrapping] Does the String wrapping in all error variants allow unbounded memory consumption through extremely long error messages, enabling memory exhaustion DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Serialization] Can the Serialize/Deserialize derive on the Error enum be exploited by malicious peers sending crafted error responses that cause deserialization vulnerabilities or consume excessive CPU during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Metrics Manipulation] Can an attacker cause metric pollution or incorrect monitoring by triggering specific error paths that map to misleading labels, hiding actual attack patterns in metrics aggregation? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [String Allocation] Does get_label() returning static string references create any timing side-channels where the error type could be inferred from response timing differences in metric collection? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Label Consistency] Are the static labels ('invalid_request', 'storage_error', 'too_many_invalid_requests', 'unexpected_error') consistently used across all metric collection points, or can inconsistency allow attackers to bypass monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<responses::Error>] [Error Conversion] Does converting all responses::Error types to UnexpectedErrorEncountered lose critical security context, allowing actual InvalidRequest scenarios to avoid rate limiting when coming from response errors? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<responses::Error>] [Error Chain Loss] Can the to_string() conversion in the From implementation lose important error chain information needed for security auditing and forensics of attack attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<responses::Error>] [Type Safety] Does the blanket conversion of all response errors to UnexpectedErrorEncountered prevent proper handling of malicious vs benign errors, allowing attackers to trigger benign-looking unexpected errors repeatedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Error Handling] Can attackers exploit the anyhow::Error to UnexpectedErrorEncountered conversion by triggering specific anyhow error paths that should be treated as InvalidRequest for rate limiting purposes? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Stack Trace Leakage] Does the to_string() on anyhow::Error potentially leak stack traces or internal code paths that reveal system internals to malicious peers analyzing error responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Error Coercion] Can malicious code paths intentionally return anyhow::Error instead of proper Error types to bypass the InvalidRequest counting mechanism in the request moderator? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Context Loss] Does converting anyhow errors (which preserve full context chains) to simple strings lose security-relevant information about the error's origin and cause? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [Error Classification] Can attackers trigger specific AptosDbError types that are actually caused by invalid requests but get classified as StorageErrorEncountered, avoiding rate limiting while repeatedly probing storage? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [Database State] Does the StorageErrorEncountered classification for all AptosDbError types mask database corruption or attacks in progress by treating them as normal storage errors rather than security incidents? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [Error Propagation] Can malicious peers cause cascading StorageErrorEncountered errors that exhaust error logging resources while the actual cause is peer misbehavior that should trigger InvalidRequest? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [Side Channel] Do database errors converted to StorageErrorEncountered leak timing information about internal storage structure or state that helps attackers map the database? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: InvalidRequest] [Rate Limiting Bypass] In the moderator's validate_request function, can an attacker craft requests that technically should increment invalid_request_count but instead trigger StorageErrorEncountered or UnexpectedErrorEncountered, bypassing the ignore mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: InvalidRequest] [Message Content] Can the String parameter in InvalidRequest be exploited to inject malicious content into logs or metrics that could affect log analysis tools or monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: InvalidRequest] [Error Fatigue] Can attackers deliberately trigger high volumes of InvalidRequest errors to create alert fatigue for operators, masking more serious attacks hidden in the noise? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: InvalidRequest] [Boundary Validation] Does InvalidRequest properly capture all input validation failures, or can some malformed inputs pass validation and cause downstream vulnerabilities classified as other error types? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: StorageErrorEncountered] [Availability Attack] Can malicious peers repeatedly trigger legitimate StorageErrorEncountered errors (e.g., requesting non-existent versions) to map storage availability and prune windows without being rate-limited? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: StorageErrorEncountered] [Resource Exhaustion] Does StorageErrorEncountered error handling allocate unbounded resources for error message strings containing large storage contexts, enabling memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
