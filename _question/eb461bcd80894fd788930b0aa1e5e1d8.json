  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Upgrade: Version compatibility] [Protocol upgrade] When the ChangeSet format changes in a protocol upgrade, can old nodes properly deserialize new ChangeSets without corrupting state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Migration: Event format] [V1 to V2 transition] During migration from V1 events to V2 events, can ChangeSets contain events in transition states that violate invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Upgrade: Hotness field] [WriteSet hotness] When WriteSet adds hotness tracking, can ChangeSets from old transactions be properly deserialized, or does missing hotness data cause failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: State grinding] [Malicious WriteSet] Can an attacker repeatedly submit transactions to create ChangeSets that, when applied, result in specific hash patterns useful for attacks on the Merkle tree? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Event spam] [Event flooding] Can an attacker create transactions that produce ChangeSets with maximum allowed events, flooding storage and degrading indexer performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Metadata manipulation] [StateValue metadata] Can an attacker craft WriteOps in the ChangeSet with manipulated metadata to claim storage refunds for state they didn't create? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Ordering dependency] [Non-commutative changes] If two ChangeSets modify overlapping state keys, can their application order affect final state in ways that break transaction isolation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Fee bypass] [Fee statement] Can a ChangeSet omit fee-related events or state changes to avoid paying transaction fees while still modifying state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Total supply] [Supply manipulation] Can a ChangeSet modify the total supply state key without triggering proper accounting, allowing inflation or deflation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Access control bypass] [System state modification] Can user transactions produce ChangeSets that modify system-protected state keys (e.g., validator set) that should only be writable by special transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Attack: Replay with modification] [Modified replay] Can an attacker take a legitimate ChangeSet from one transaction and replay it with modified events or WriteSet entries? (Critical)"
