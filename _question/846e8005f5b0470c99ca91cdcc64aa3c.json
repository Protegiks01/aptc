  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Concurrency] [Event Processing Race] When multiple validators process the same TokenDeposit event concurrently, can race conditions in event indexing cause some validators to miss deposits while others record them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Concurrency] [Send/Sync Bounds] Are TokenDeposit, TokenId, and TokenDataId properly marked Send/Sync for cross-thread use, or can improper synchronization cause data races in parallel event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Account Field] [Address Normalization] Can different representations of the same account address (with/without leading zeros, different encodings) result in distinct AccountAddress values, causing deposit routing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Account Field] [Reserved Addresses] Can deposits be made to reserved addresses (0x0, 0x1, VM addresses) that should not hold tokens, breaking system invariants or enabling privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Property Version] [Version Monotonicity] Does the system enforce that property_version only increases monotonically, or can version decreases/resets be used to manipulate token state or bypass ownership checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Property Version] [Initial Version] Is property_version = 0 reserved for newly minted tokens, or can confusion between version 0 and uninitialized tokens lead to double-deposits or lost funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Amount Field] [Max Value Deposits] When amount is set to u64::MAX, can this cause overflow in balance tracking, reward calculations, or fee computations that assume headroom for addition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Amount Field] [Fractional Tokens] Can the u64 amount field properly represent fractional token amounts if the token has decimals, or can rounding errors accumulate and allow theft through precision manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Collection Field] [Case Sensitivity] Are collection names case-sensitive, and can attackers create duplicate collections with different casing (e.g., 'NFT' vs 'nft') to confuse users or bypass filters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Collection Field] [Whitespace Handling] Can leading/trailing whitespace in collection names cause matching failures or allow creation of visually identical but distinct collections for phishing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Name Field] [Special Characters] Can token names contain path traversal characters (../, etc.) or command injection sequences that exploit downstream processing systems or indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Name Field] [UTF-8 Validity] Are collection and name strings validated as valid UTF-8, or can invalid UTF-8 sequences cause panics, crashes, or undefined behavior when processing events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Creator Field] [Creator Validation] Can the creator address in TokenDataId be different from the actual account that created the token, allowing impersonation attacks or attribution manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Creator Field] [Self-Creation] Can an account deposit tokens to itself that it claims to have created, bypassing minting restrictions and inflating supply without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Type System] [Generic Type Confusion] Although TokenDeposit has no type parameters, can type erasure or monomorphization bugs cause confusion with generic token types that have different security properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Type System] [Trait Object Safety] If TokenDeposit is used as a trait object (Box<dyn MoveEventV2Type>), can vtable manipulation or type confusion attacks bypass security checks during event dispatch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Storage] [Duplicate Events] Can the same TokenDeposit event be indexed multiple times due to reorgs or consensus issues, causing double-counting of deposits in user balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Storage] [Event Pruning] When historical events are pruned from storage, can this create gaps that break token ownership proofs or historical balance queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Storage] [Query Injection] Can malicious strings in TokenDataId fields exploit SQL injection or NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in event indexing databases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Error Handling] [Silent Failures] When try_from_bytes() fails, is the error properly propagated and logged, or can silent deserialization failures cause events to be silently dropped, losing deposit records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Propagation] Can panics during event processing (e.g., from integer overflow) cause validator crashes that are exploitable for liveness attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Determinism] [Non-Deterministic Serialization] Can differences in serialization order (e.g., for HashMap-backed internal structures) cause validators to produce different event hashes, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Determinism] [Floating Point] Are there any floating-point operations in token amount calculations that could cause non-deterministic results across different CPU architectures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Gas Metering] [String Size Gas] Is gas properly charged for the size of collection and name strings, or can attackers emit events with huge strings at minimal gas cost to bloat state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Gas Metering] [Deserialization Gas] Is gas charged for the computational cost of deserializing complex TokenDeposit structures, or can attackers craft events that are expensive to process but cheap to emit? (Medium)"
