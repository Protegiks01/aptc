(Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/state_sync_version.rs] [Function: build_state_sync_version_check_result()] [Tolerance gaming] Can an attacker configure version_delta_tolerance to be exactly equal to expected network lag, allowing a malicious node to stay just within tolerance while being maximally out of sync? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/state_sync_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Single result] Why does check() return a Vec with only one element (line 164), and can this design allow result aggregation bugs if multiple results are expected elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/state_sync_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Result consistency] Can the mix of CheckResult returns (lines 134, 149, 164) and CheckerError returns (line 160) cause inconsistent handling by calling code? (Low)",
