(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: insert_coin_activities()] [Gas fee activity collision] Given that gas fee events use BURN_GAS_EVENT_CREATION_NUM (-1) and BURN_GAS_EVENT_INDEX (-1), can an attacker create legitimate events with these values to collide with gas fee records? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: insert_coin_activities()] [Batch ordering] If coin_activities array is not sorted by primary key, can the do_nothing() conflict handling cause non-deterministic behavior across different indexer runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: insert_coin_activities()] [NULL field handling] If any fields in CoinActivity contain NULL values when do_nothing() is triggered, does PostgreSQL handle this correctly or could it cause constraint violations? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: insert_coin_infos()] [Metadata manipulation] At lines 165-174, all coin metadata (name, symbol, decimals) is updated on conflict - can an attacker update a legitimate coin's metadata by creating a transaction with higher version number?
