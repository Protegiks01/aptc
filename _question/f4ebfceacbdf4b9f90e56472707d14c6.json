  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Configuration loading] During node startup, if DKGConfig is loaded and applied asynchronously, can race conditions cause the DKG network channel to be created with wrong size or uninitialized values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Hot reload] If configuration hot-reloading is supported, can changing max_network_channel_size while DKG is running cause channel resize operations that drop in-flight messages or corrupt channel state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Clone safety] The DKGConfig struct implements Clone - can concurrent cloning during configuration updates lead to TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities where stale channel sizes are used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Strategic message timing] Can rational validators exploit knowledge of max_network_channel_size to strategically time their DKG transcript submissions to maximize their message acceptance while crowding out competitors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Validator collusion] Can a coalition of validators (< f) collude to synchronize message bursts that fill channels up to max_network_channel_size, creating predictable message dropping patterns that favor the coalition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Silent failure] When DKG messages are dropped due to channel overflow, is there monitoring/alerting, or do validators silently fail DKG protocol without visibility into the root cause being insufficient max_network_channel_size? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Capacity monitoring] Is there runtime monitoring of actual channel utilization vs max_network_channel_size to detect when the buffer is consistently full, indicating undersizing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Configuration audit] Are changes to max_network_channel_size logged and auditable, or can attackers modify this critical parameter without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Inconsistent defaults] The DKG default is 256, while consensus uses different values - could these inconsistencies cause subtle bugs when DKG and consensus interact during epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Cross-protocol coordination] Does max_network_channel_size coordinate with mempool, consensus, and other network channel sizes to prevent systemic resource exhaustion attacks across multiple protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [usize platform dependency] On 32-bit systems (if supported), usize is 32-bit - could this create platform-specific vulnerabilities where max_network_channel_size wraps differently than on 64-bit systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Default trait safety] The Default implementation is unconditional - should it instead be conditional on node role (validator vs fullnode) with different buffer sizes, or could fullnodes unnecessarily allocate large buffers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Derive macros] [Serialization safety] The PartialEq derive is used for comparison - could this create subtle bugs if DKGConfig is compared during configuration migrations or version upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing adaptive sizing] Should max_network_channel_size be adaptive based on validator set size, or is the static configuration vulnerable to network growth without manual reconfiguration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing timeout config] The struct only configures channel size but not message timeouts - could long-lived messages in the channel (up to max_network_channel_size) cause head-of-line blocking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing priority] Should DKG messages have priority levels with separate channel sizes for critical vs non-critical messages, or can low-priority messages fill the channel and block high-priority ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing rate limiting] Is there per-peer rate limiting configuration to prevent any single validator from filling max_network_channel_size, or can one Byzantine validator monopolize the buffer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Randomness generation failure] If DKG fails due to message dropping from insufficient channel capacity, how does this affect randomness-dependent features (leader election, validator sampling), and could this be exploited for consensus manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Epoch stalling] Can systematic DKG failures due to channel overflow cause validators to refuse epoch transitions, creating a permanent network stall requiring manual intervention? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Fallback behavior] If DKG cannot complete due to message dropping, is there a secure fallback mechanism, or does the network simply halt randomness generation indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Partial DKG] Could insufficient channel capacity cause partial DKG completion where only a subset of validators successfully aggregate transcripts, creating validator set splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Environment variable injection] If max_network_channel_size can be overridden via environment variables, can attackers with shell access modify this without directly editing config files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Command-line injection] Does the node accept max_network_channel_size as a command-line argument, and if so, are there injection vulnerabilities in parsing these arguments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Default override chain] What is the precedence order for max_network_channel_size (default → config file → env var → CLI), and can attackers exploit confusion in this chain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Boundary testing] Has max_network_channel_size been fuzz-tested with boundary values (0, 1, usize::MAX, negative values via type confusion) to ensure robust handling? (Medium)"
