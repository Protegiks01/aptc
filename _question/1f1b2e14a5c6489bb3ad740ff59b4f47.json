  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Symlink Attack] Can the file paths in ListManagerConfig or IpRangeManagerConfig be symlinks pointing to sensitive files, allowing an attacker to include unauthorized content in allowlists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [File Permission] Does the config validation check that allowlist files have appropriate permissions (not world-writable), or can local attackers modify allowlists to gain bypass access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Directory Traversal] Can relative paths in config files (e.g., ../../etc/passwd) be exploited to read arbitrary files during bypasser initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [File Injection] Can environment variables or config interpolation in file paths be exploited to inject malicious file paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [File Watcher] If the implementation watches allowlist files for changes, can an attacker exploit file watch events to trigger unintended bypasser reloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Token Length] Does the auth token validation have a maximum length check, or can extremely long tokens cause buffer issues or performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Special Characters] Do auth tokens properly handle special characters (quotes, null bytes, control characters) that could cause parsing errors or injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [IP Format Validation] Does the IP allowlist properly validate CIDR notation, or can malformed entries like '256.256.256.256/33' cause parsing errors or bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Whitespace Handling] Does token comparison trim whitespace, or can an attacker add leading/trailing spaces to a valid token to bypass checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [Comment Injection] Can an attacker inject comment characters (#, //) into CIDR ranges to hide malicious entries or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Audit Trail] When a request bypasses checks, is this properly logged with sufficient detail (IP, token, amount) to detect abuse, or can attackers exploit bypasses silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Log Injection] Can an attacker craft bypass requests with malicious data (e.g., newlines in tokens) that inject fake log entries to hide their activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Initialization Logging] Are bypasser initialization events (loaded token count, IP ranges) logged, or can attackers modify configs silently without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Metrics Bypass] Does successful bypass skip rate limit metrics and monitoring, making it invisible to automated abuse detection systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Error Logging] When bypasser checks fail with errors, are these errors logged with sufficient context to debug security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser] [From Conversion] Can the From<AuthTokenBypasser> and From<IpAllowlistBypasser> conversions be exploited to create invalid Bypasser enum states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Lifetime Safety] Does the 'static lifetime bound on BypasserTrait prevent dangling references, or can short-lived data be unsafely converted to bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Move Semantics] When BypasserConfig is consumed by build(), does this prevent accidental reuse, or can the same config be built multiple times with inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Clone Depth] Does the Clone implementation for BypasserConfig perform deep clones of file paths, or can shallow clones lead to unexpected mutations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Async Drop] If a Bypasser is dropped while an async request_can_bypass() is in progress, can this cause use-after-free or other memory safety issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Multiple Bypassers] If the faucet config includes both AuthToken and IpAllowlist bypassers, are they AND-ed or OR-ed, and can this logic be exploited to weaken security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Empty Allowlist] If a bypasser is configured but points to a non-existent or empty file, does it deny all bypasses or fail open allowing everything? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Config Validation] Does build() validate that the resulting bypasser is not trivially bypassable (e.g., allowlist contains 0.0.0.0/0)? (High)",
