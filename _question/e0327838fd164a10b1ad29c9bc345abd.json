  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Module dependency ordering] If one native module depends on another (e.g., reflect using result), does the registration order ensure proper initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [SafeNativeBuilder lifecycle] The SafeNativeBuilder is passed to all make_all functions - can its state accumulate errors or become corrupted during registration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Native function isolation] Can one misbehaving native function corrupt the state used by other natives, or are they properly isolated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Gas context sharing] All natives share the same SafeNativeContext - can one native's gas charging affect another native's execution in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type argument validation] Do all registered natives properly validate their type arguments, or can some accept invalid type parameters causing type unsafety? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Gas parameter consistency] Each native uses different gas parameters (BCS_*, HASH_*, VECTOR_*, etc.) - are these parameters consistently updated across network upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Partial gas charging] When BCS serialization fails, partial gas is charged before returning an error - can attackers exploit this to learn information through gas consumption patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: vector] [Gas calculation discrepancy] move_range gas calculation counts moved elements multiple times - is this calibration still accurate after VM optimizations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: string] [Per-byte vs per-char] String operations charge per-byte but operate on characters - can this discrepancy be exploited with multi-byte UTF-8 characters? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [NFE_BCS_SERIALIZATION_FAILURE] This abort code is reused across multiple failure scenarios - can attackers distinguish between different failure types to leak information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: string] [Generic abort code] native_sub_string uses 'abort_code: 1' with a TODO comment - is this temporary code in production and what are its security implications? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type parameter forwarding] Each native receives ty_args array - is there validation that the number and kind of type arguments match the function signature? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Type layout caching] type_to_type_layout is called repeatedly - is there caching to prevent redundant expensive layout construction? (Low)",
