  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Error handling: Storage errors] If RocksDB returns IO errors during get/put operations on BlockInfoSchema, can error handling cause panics that crash validators instead of graceful degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Validation: Backward compatibility] Can old validators deserialize BlockInfo written by new validators with additional fields, or will BCS strict mode reject them causing consensus divergence during rolling upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Cryptography: Block ID integrity] Does BlockInfoSchema verify that BlockInfo.id matches the hash of block contents, or can mismatched IDs be stored enabling block ID forgery and consensus confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Cryptography: State root verification] Can BlockInfo.executed_state_id be stored without verification against actual Merkle tree state root, allowing state root manipulation that breaks light client proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Cryptography: Hash collision] If two different blocks produce the same BlockInfo.id via hash collision, can they both be stored with different block_height values, causing chain fork confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Cryptography: Epoch state signature] When BlockInfo.next_epoch_state is stored, does the schema verify the epoch state's validator signatures, or can unsigned/invalid epoch states be injected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Storage: Pruning safety] During ledger pruning, can BlockInfoSchema entries be deleted while still referenced by BlockByVersionSchema, creating dangling pointers that cause get_block_info to fail for existing versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Storage: Snapshot consistency] When creating database snapshots, can BlockInfoSchema be captured mid-write resulting in snapshots with incomplete or corrupted block metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Storage: Disk corruption] If disk corruption affects BlockInfoSchema, can validators detect and recover, or will they continue serving incorrect block metadata to consensus and API clients? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Storage: Backup integrity] During database backup/restore, can BlockInfoSchema become inconsistent with other schemas (like transaction or state storage) causing restored nodes to have mismatched block metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Storage: Write amplification] Can repeated writes to BlockInfoSchema during high block production rates cause RocksDB write amplification that degrades performance and causes validators to fall behind consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Consensus: Epoch boundary] Can BlockInfo at epoch boundaries be manipulated in the schema to have next_epoch_state with unauthorized validators, bypassing stake requirements and governance approval? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Consensus: Block proposal verification] Does the schema enforce that only blocks from authorized validators are stored, or can any node write arbitrary BlockInfo entries bypassing consensus validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Consensus: Timestamp monotonicity] Can BlockInfo be stored with timestamps that decrease relative to previous blocks, violating consensus assumptions about time progression and breaking timeout calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Consensus: Round monotonicity] Can BlockInfo with decreasing round numbers be stored within an epoch, enabling round rollback attacks that allow re-proposing previously rejected blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Consensus: Version gaps] Can BlockInfoSchema have blocks with non-contiguous version numbers (e.g., version 100 to 105 missing), causing transaction queries to fail and breaking ledger history integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [API: Block metadata queries] Can API clients query BlockInfoSchema directly and retrieve BlockInfo with sensitive validator information or internal state that should not be publicly exposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [API: Height enumeration] Can attackers enumerate all block heights by iterating BlockInfoSchema to discover chain growth patterns, validator timing, or transaction volume data for MEV attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [API: Resource exhaustion] Can API queries requesting BlockInfo for very high or very low block_height values cause expensive RocksDB seeks that exhaust node resources during DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Edge case: Genesis block] Is BlockHeight = 0 (genesis) handled specially, or can querying genesis block return None/error causing bootstrapping failures for new validators joining the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Edge case: Latest block] When querying the latest committed block via highest BlockHeight, can race conditions return BlockInfo for a block that hasn't been fully persisted yet, causing consensus on incomplete data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Edge case: Empty chain] On a fresh validator before genesis, can BlockInfoSchema queries return incorrect defaults instead of proper errors, causing validators to start with corrupted initial state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Edge case: Block height gap] If blockchain forks and discards blocks, can BlockInfoSchema retain orphaned blocks with heights that will never be filled, causing permanent gaps in block history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Edge case: Duplicate heights] Can network forks or database replication issues cause two different BlockInfo entries to exist for the same block_height in different validators' databases, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Performance: Scan attacks] Can attackers force full BlockInfoSchema scans by requesting block ranges with very wide spans, exhausting disk I/O and degrading validator performance during consensus? (Medium)"
