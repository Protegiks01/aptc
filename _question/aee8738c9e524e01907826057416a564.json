  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Static: ROYALTY_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] The type tag uses TOKEN_ADDRESS constant - can this be exploited if TOKEN_ADDRESS is compromised or points to unexpected module, causing type confusion in event routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV2Type] [Event versioning] Does MoveEventV2Type implementation ensure backward compatibility, or can schema changes break deserialization of historical RoyaltyMutate events causing audit trail loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Static: ROYALTY_MUTATE_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Can concurrent access to ROYALTY_MUTATE_TYPE during validator startup cause race conditions in type registration, leading to event routing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Getters: old_royalty_numerator/denominator] [Precision loss] When calculating actual royalty percentages from numerator/denominator, can integer division cause precision loss that allows attackers to avoid paying correct royalties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Denominator manipulation] Can attacker set extremely large denominators (near u64::MAX) to make royalty percentages appear negligible, effectively nullifying royalty payments while technically having non-zero values?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Rounding exploitation] Can attackers exploit rounding behavior in royalty calculations by setting specific numerator/denominator combinations that consistently round down, stealing fractional royalties at scale? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Economic DoS] Can malicious actors repeatedly mutate royalties between extreme values (0% to 99.99%) to generate excessive events that bloat storage and degrade indexer performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Unauthorized mutation] Does the event structure itself enforce that only the creator can mutate royalties, or can any address emit RoyaltyMutate events for tokens they don't own? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Payee hijacking] Can malicious actors emit events that change new_royalty_payee_addr to their own address without on-chain authorization, redirecting future royalty payments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Collection ownership] Does the event verify that the emitter owns or controls the collection before allowing royalty mutations, or can outsiders modify collection-level royalty settings? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Event ordering] Can concurrent royalty mutations cause events to be emitted in non-deterministic order, making it impossible for indexers to determine the correct final royalty state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Memory leak] Do the String fields (collection, token) properly deallocate when RoyaltyMutate structs are dropped, or can repeated event creation cause memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
