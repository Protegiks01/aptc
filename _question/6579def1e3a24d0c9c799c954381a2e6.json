  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha2_256()] [Test Coverage] Can edge cases like maximum-size inputs, empty vectors, or repeated hash calls expose untested code paths with security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha3_256()] [Test Coverage] Can specific input patterns (all zeros, all ones, alternating bits) trigger bugs in the hash implementation that aren't caught by standard tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha2_256()] [Fuzzing Gaps] Can fuzzing tools discover input sequences that cause panics, infinite loops, or other unexpected behaviors in the hash computation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha3_256()] [Fuzzing Gaps] Can property-based testing reveal cases where gas charges don't match actual computational costs, enabling gas manipulation? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha3_256()] [Gas Timing] Can attackers abort transactions after gas is calculated (line 88) but before the hash is computed (line 95), causing inconsistent gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha2_256()] [Gas Refund] Can the gas cost calculation at lines 42-47 be manipulated to claim gas refunds by aborting transactions at specific points? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/hash.rs] [Function: native_sha3_256()] [Gas Refund] Can partial execution of hash operations enable gas refund attacks where attackers pay less gas than they consume? (Medium)",
