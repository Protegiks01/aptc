  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted URL with special characters or encoding that bypasses URL validation in the clap parser at line 16, potentially leading to SSRF attacks when the client connects to an attacker-controlled endpoint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [URL Injection] Does the Url parsing at line 16 properly sanitize path traversal sequences (../, ..\\), allowing an attacker to craft URLs that access unintended endpoints or bypass security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Protocol Validation] Can an attacker specify non-HTTPS protocols (http://, ftp://, file://) in api_url at line 16, downgrading connection security and enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on sensitive account data queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Host Validation] Does the URL validation at line 16 prevent localhost/internal IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.x.x, 10.x.x.x), or can an attacker use this to scan internal networks and bypass firewall rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Port Validation] Can an attacker specify arbitrary ports in api_url including privileged ports (<1024) or ports used by other services, enabling cross-protocol attacks or service interference? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Logger Initialization] Does aptos_logger::Logger::new().init() at line 23 have any vulnerabilities related to log injection, where attacker-controlled input from args could be logged and exploited for command injection or log poisoning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Debug Logging] At line 26, args are logged with debug! macro - can sensitive data (API keys, tokens) embedded in the URL query string be exposed in logs, leading to credential leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Client Creation] Does Client::new(args.api_url) at line 28 validate the URL scheme and reject insecure connections, or can an attacker downgrade to HTTP enabling interception of account balance and resource data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Client Configuration] Does Client::new() at line 28 set appropriate timeouts, or can an attacker control a malicious endpoint that never responds, causing resource exhaustion through hung connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [TLS Validation] Does Client::new() at line 28 properly validate TLS certificates, or can an attacker perform man-in-the-middle attacks with self-signed certificates to intercept account queries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Client Reuse] Is the Client instance at line 28 reused for multiple requests without connection pooling limits, potentially causing resource exhaustion if the endpoint returns slowly or hangs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Address Hardcoding] The hardcoded AccountAddress::ONE at line 30 is a system account - does querying this specific account expose privileged system state or governance information that could be used to identify vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Information Disclosure] At line 31, the account address is logged via info! - if this were a real application with user-provided addresses, could this leak sensitive account information to logs accessible by attackers? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unchecked Results] The response at line 33 uses .await and .context() - if the endpoint returns HTTP 200 with invalid JSON, will error handling properly prevent processing of corrupted data? (Medium)",
