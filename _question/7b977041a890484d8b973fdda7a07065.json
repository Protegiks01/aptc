  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: rename_db_folders_and_cleanup()] [Partial Restore] Can an attacker interrupt the restore process after rename_db_folders_and_cleanup() succeeds but before validator restarts, causing the validator to come up with an incomplete or corrupted database state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Integration] [Cross-Validator Contamination] If a compromised validator creates backups using create_tar_gz() that are shared with other validators, can malformed archives cause a cascading failure across multiple validators simultaneously impacting network liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Integration] [Consensus State Corruption] Can restoring a database backup that contains consensus state from a different chain or fork cause the validator to produce conflicting votes or blocks that violate AptosBFT safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Integration] [Epoch Boundary Attack] If a backup is restored during an epoch transition, can this cause validators to have inconsistent views of the validator set leading to network partition and loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Integration] [State Root Divergence] Can differences in compression algorithms, tar implementations, or filesystem metadata cause two validators restoring the same backup to calculate different state roots, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Integration] [Merkle Tree Corruption] If the restored database contains a corrupted Jellyfish Merkle tree, will validators detect this during state proof verification, or will they accept and propagate invalid state to the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [All Functions] [Missing Authorization] Are there access control checks preventing unauthorized users or processes from calling these backup/restore functions, or can any process with file system access trigger potentially destructive operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: unpack_tar_gz()] [Privilege Requirements] Does restore operation require elevated privileges that could be exploited for privilege escalation if the function is called with attacker-controlled paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: create_tar_gz()] [Backup Access Control] Are created backup archives protected with appropriate file permissions, or can other processes on the system read sensitive validator state from backup files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: create_tar_gz()] [Empty Directory] Does create_tar_gz() handle empty directories correctly, or can backing up an empty database create invalid archives that fail to restore? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: unpack_tar_gz()] [Nested Archives] Can tar archives contain nested tar.gz files that, when extracted, consume exponential disk space in a decompression bomb variant? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: rename_db_folders_and_cleanup()] [Same Path Arguments] What happens if original_db_path equals temp_old_db_path or restored_db_path - can this create logic errors or infinite loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/backup_restore/fs_ops.rs] [Function: unpack_tar_gz()] [Archive with No Files] Does extraction of an archive containing no files result in an empty database that appears valid but causes validator startup failures? (Medium)"
