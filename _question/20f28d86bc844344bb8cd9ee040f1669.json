  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 27: aptos_dkg_rounding_seconds metric name] [Cryptographic timing leak] Can unauthenticated access to aptos_dkg_rounding_seconds expose cryptographic operation timings that enable remote timing attacks on DKG key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 8-14: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES across validators] [Cross-validator consistency] Do all validators record PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES identically for the same DKG session state, or can metric divergence indicate Byzantine behavior or state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 16-23: DKG_STAGE_SECONDS determinism] [Non-deterministic recording] Can different validators record different DKG_STAGE_SECONDS values for the same DKG session due to clock skew, causing confusion in cross-validator debugging and anomaly detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 25-32: ROUNDING_SECONDS consistency] [Implementation divergence] If different validator implementations calculate ROUNDING_SECONDS differently, can this mask implementation bugs or Byzantine behavior in DKG rounding operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [All metrics: audit trail] [Forensic gap] Are DKG metrics retained long enough for post-incident forensics, or do metric retention policies prevent analysis of past DKG failures and Byzantine attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 16-23: DKG_STAGE_SECONDS historical data] [Incident investigation] Can historical DKG_STAGE_SECONDS data be tampered with or deleted by compromised nodes to cover up evidence of DKG protocol violations or attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/counters.rs] [Line: 8-14: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES logging] [Audit completeness] Does PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES provide sufficient granularity to audit DKG message handling, or can attackers exploit gaps in metric coverage to perform undetectable attacks? (Low)"
