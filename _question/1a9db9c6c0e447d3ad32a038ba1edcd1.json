  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Resource Collision] Can funding create CoinStore resources that conflict with existing resources under the same account, potentially overwriting or corrupting other resource data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker specify a malicious session path using '../' to load and modify session files outside the intended directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Session Hijacking] If Session::load() doesn't validate file ownership or permissions, can an attacker load and modify another user's session files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Session Corruption] If multiple Fund commands are executed concurrently on the same session, can race conditions in session loading/saving corrupt the delta state or lose funding transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [State Persistence] After fund_account() modifies state, is the session automatically saved, or can state changes be lost if the process crashes before explicit save? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Audit Trail] Are funding operations logged with sufficient detail (who, when, how much) to detect suspicious patterns or simulate real-world attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker specify a malicious session path using '../' to read session files and extract sensitive resource data from other users' sessions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker view sensitive resources (private keys, auth tokens, internal state) by specifying specific StructTag values without proper access control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [StructTag Injection] Does the resource parameter properly validate StructTag format, or can malformed tags cause parsing errors that leak information through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Account Enumeration] Can an attacker enumerate all accounts in a session by iterating through addresses and viewing their resources, potentially mapping the entire state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker specify a StructTag that doesn't match the actual resource type at that address, causing type confusion bugs or crashes in view_resource()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [JSON Serialization] Does view_resource() properly sanitize resource data before JSON serialization, or can malicious resource content cause injection attacks or break JSON parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Session Leak] If Session::load() fails to close file handles properly, can repeated ViewResource calls cause file descriptor exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Concurrent Access] If ViewResource is called while another command is modifying the session, can this lead to viewing partially updated state or corrupted data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResource::execute()] [Error Information Leak] Do error messages from view_resource() expose sensitive information about session structure, file paths, or internal state details? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResourceGroup::execute()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker view sensitive resource groups without proper authorization, potentially exposing grouped resources that should be access-controlled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResourceGroup::execute()] [StructTag Validation] Does the resource_group parameter properly validate StructTag format to prevent injection attacks or parsing exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResourceGroup::execute()] [Derived Object Address] Can an attacker manipulate the derived_object_address parameter to access objects they shouldn't have access to, bypassing object ownership checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResourceGroup::execute()] [Object Address Collision] If derived_object_address is specified, can hash collisions in object address derivation allow accessing other users' objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: ViewResourceGroup::execute()] [Type Confusion] Can mismatched resource_group types cause view_resource_group() to misinterpret data structure, leading to information disclosure or crashes? (Medium)",
