  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Slow lock acquisition] If high contention on consensus-critical mutexes causes lock() to block for extended periods, can this be exploited to delay block proposals beyond timeout thresholds, manipulating leader election? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Priority inversion] If low-priority threads (e.g., API handlers) hold Mutex locks needed by high-priority consensus threads, can attackers flood APIs to create priority inversion, delaying consensus and causing timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Lock convoy effect] In transaction execution pipelines using Mutex for shared state access, can carefully timed transaction submissions create lock convoys that serialize parallel execution, defeating Block-STM's performance and enabling timing-based attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Struct: Mutex<T>] [Send/Sync bounds] Are the Send and Sync bounds on T properly validated, or could this wrapper be used with non-thread-safe types (e.g., Rc<T>) in multi-threaded consensus code, causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Struct: Mutex<T>] [Interior mutability bypass] Can Mutex<Cell<T>> or Mutex<RefCell<T>> patterns be used to bypass Rust's borrow checker in critical code paths, allowing multiple mutable references to consensus state and causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization race] If multiple threads concurrently call Mutex::new() with the same underlying data structure (e.g., during validator initialization), are there race conditions in the wrapped StdMutex::new() that could lead to undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Guard lifetime issues] Can MutexGuard lifetimes be extended unsafely (e.g., via std::mem::forget) to hold locks indefinitely, deadlocking critical consensus paths and causing permanent validator freeze? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Default implementation] [Type confusion] The Default impl for Mutex<Option<T>> always returns None - can this be exploited in code expecting Some(T), causing panics when unwrapping protected Optional values in validator configuration or key material? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Test: test_mutex()] [Insufficient panic coverage] The test doesn't verify behavior when locks are poisoned - are there integration tests ensuring that critical Aptos components (consensus, VM, storage) handle poisoned-lock panics without causing safety violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Test: test_mutex()] [No concurrent panic testing] Does any test verify behavior when multiple threads simultaneously trigger panics while holding different Mutex instances, ensuring no cascading failures or deadlocks occur in consensus-critical code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Test: test_mutex()] [Missing stress tests] Are there stress tests simulating high contention on mutexes protecting consensus state under Byzantine attack scenarios (e.g., 33% validators submitting malicious blocks)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Formal verification gap] Has the panic-on-poison behavior been formally verified to maintain Aptos safety invariants (no double-spending, state consistency) under all possible panic scenarios in consensus/VM/storage code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Transaction-triggered panic] Can an attacker craft a Move transaction that causes VM execution threads to panic while holding mutexes protecting transaction output state, poisoning locks and crashing all validators attempting to execute the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Reconfiguration attack] During epoch transitions when validator set mutexes are heavily accessed, can a Byzantine validator submit malformed reconfiguration transactions that trigger panics, poisoning locks and preventing 2/3 validators from completing the epoch change? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [State proof generation DoS] If state proof generation for light clients uses Mutex to protect Merkle tree traversal state, can malicious state proof requests trigger panics that poison locks, preventing any client from syncing and causing network unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: into_inner()] [Snapshot corruption] When creating state snapshots for fast sync, if into_inner() panics while consuming mutexes protecting snapshot metadata, can this corrupt snapshot files on disk, making the validator unrecoverable without full resync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Validator set manipulation] Can an attacker coordinate panic-inducing actions across multiple validators right before a validator set update vote, ensuring that honest validators' mutexes are poisoned and they crash, allowing the attacker's validators to dominate the next epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Zero-sized types] If Mutex<()> or other zero-sized types are used for signaling in consensus coordination, does the panic behavior correctly handle cases where no actual data is protected but synchronization is still required? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: into_inner()] [Moved mutex behavior] After calling into_inner() and consuming the mutex, if another thread still holds a (cloned) reference to the wrapped StdMutex, can this cause use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities in critical consensus data structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Recursive locking attempt] If code accidentally tries to recursively lock the same Mutex (e.g., consensus code calling itself during round changes), will this deadlock immediately or poison the lock, and does the panic message clearly indicate the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Struct: Mutex<T>] [Large type handling] For Mutex<LargeStruct> where LargeStruct is megabytes (e.g., cached Merkle tree nodes), can lock contention cause stack overflows when guards are created, or OOM panics that poison locks and crash validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Panic hook interaction] If custom panic hooks are installed for logging/metrics, do they execute correctly when .expect() panics on poisoned locks, or can the hook itself panic, causing double panics and ungraceful validator termination? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [API/Consensus interaction] If REST API threads and consensus threads share mutexes protecting validator state, can malicious API requests trigger panics that poison locks, preventing consensus threads from progressing and causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Storage/VM interaction] When the VM writes execution results to storage and both use Mutex for synchronization, can a panic in the VM thread poison the storage lock, preventing subsequent transactions from committing and causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Mempool/Consensus race] If mempool and consensus share mutexes for transaction ordering, can a panic in mempool validation poison locks needed by consensus block proposal, causing validators to miss their turn and delay network progress?
