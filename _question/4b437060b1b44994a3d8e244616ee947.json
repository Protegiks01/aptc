  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Trait object safety] Does the Signature trait's use of associated types (VerifyingKeyMaterial, SigningKeyMaterial) make it non-object-safe according to Rust's trait object rules, and could this compilation test be incorrectly passing when it should fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Type system bypass] If this compilation test succeeds despite the Signature trait having associated types and Sized bound, could there be a loophole in Rust's trait object safety rules that allows runtime type confusion when downcasting trait objects? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Memory safety] When creating Vec<Box<dyn Signature>>, could the lack of initialization or destruction logic lead to memory leaks if signature implementations have non-trivial drop semantics with cryptographic key material? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Trait implementation verification] Does this test verify that all concrete Signature implementations (Ed25519Signature, MultiEd25519Signature) can be safely erased to trait objects, or could mixing incompatible signature schemes in the same vector lead to verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Wildcard import security] Does the wildcard import 'use diem_crypto::traits::*' expose internal or unsafe traits that should not be accessible in this compilation test context, potentially allowing unintended trait implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Object safety validation] If the Signature trait were modified to add methods with Self: Sized bounds or generic methods, would this compilation test catch the breaking change and fail, or could it silently succeed with runtime failures later? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Dynamic dispatch security] When signature verification is called through trait object dispatch (dyn Signature), could an attacker exploit vtable manipulation or type confusion to bypass signature checks if the concrete type is Ed25519 but dispatched as MultiEd25519? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Test coverage gap] Does this compilation test verify that the verify() and verify_arbitrary_msg() methods can be called through trait objects, or does it only check vector creation, leaving actual signature verification unvalidated? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Sealed trait bypass] The Signature trait requires private::Sealed marker trait - could creating trait objects bypass this sealing mechanism and allow external crates to implement malicious Signature types that get accepted by the system? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Batch verification safety] If multiple signature types (Ed25519, BLS, MultiSig) are stored in Vec<Box<dyn Signature>> and batch_verify() is called, could mixing incompatible schemes cause incorrect validation results where invalid signatures pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Clone trait interaction] The Signature trait requires Clone bound - when cloning trait objects through Box::clone(), could there be issues with deep copying cryptographic material that leads to key reuse or side-channel vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Hash trait security] The Signature trait requires Hash implementation - when using trait objects in hash-based collections, could different signature schemes produce hash collisions that lead to signature verification bypass in consensus or transaction validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Eq trait guarantees] With Eq bound on Signature trait objects, could there be cases where two signatures with different byte representations but same cryptographic validity are incorrectly treated as unequal, breaking consensus agreement on block signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [TryFrom deserialization] The Signature trait requires TryFrom<&[u8]> - when deserializing trait objects from untrusted byte arrays, could malformed input cause the wrong concrete type to be constructed, leading to signature verification with incorrect algorithms? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/unit_tests/compilation/cross_test_trait_obj_sig.rs] [Vector mutability] The mutable vector 'let mut l' is created but never used - in production code using similar patterns, could mutable trait object collections allow runtime signature substitution attacks where valid signatures are replaced with malicious ones? (Medium)"
