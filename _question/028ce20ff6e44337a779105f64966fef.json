  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Approve + Reject] [Griefing Attack] Can malicious owners spam approvals and rejections to prevent legitimate transactions from ever reaching threshold? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Reentrancy] Can any multisig operations trigger reentrant calls back into the multisig account, potentially corrupting state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Zero Owners] Can a multisig be created with only the sender as owner and additional_owners=[], creating a single-owner multisig that defeats the purpose? (Low)",
