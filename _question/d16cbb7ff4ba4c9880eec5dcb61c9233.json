  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: JSON] [Unicode exploitation] Does the JSON MIME type handling properly validate UTF-8 encoding, or could attackers inject malformed Unicode sequences in transaction payloads that cause parsing errors, API crashes, or bypass validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS] [Binary data handling] When BCS MIME type is used for responses, are there safeguards against returning sensitive internal data structures that should only be returned in sanitized JSON format? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [Content negotiation attacks] Could attackers use complex Accept headers with multiple MIME types and quality values to cause parser confusion, trigger unexpected code paths, or bypass security checks based on content type? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Size limit bypass] Are there consistent size limits enforced regardless of MIME type, or could attackers submit larger payloads via BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION than allowed via JSON to cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)"
