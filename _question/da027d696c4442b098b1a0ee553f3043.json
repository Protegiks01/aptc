  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Trait: TestOnlyHash] [BCS Serialization] Does test_only_hash() use the same BCS serialization as production code, or can format differences cause test hashes to be incompatible with real hashes, hiding bugs until production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Trait: PartialOrd, Ord] [Ordering Consistency] Is HashValue ordering consistent with hash computation, or can two HashValues with equal hashes have different orderings, breaking sorted data structures like BTreeMaps in state storage? (High)",
