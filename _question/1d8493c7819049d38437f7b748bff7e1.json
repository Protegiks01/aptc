  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization exploit] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that cause memory exhaustion or panic during deserialization, potentially crashing validator nodes processing event logs and causing partial loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can malformed BCS bytes bypass type checking and deserialize into CollectionMaximumMutateEvent with unexpected field values, allowing attackers to inject fake collection mutation events into the event stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does BCS deserialization properly validate u64 values for old_maximum and new_maximum, or can extremely large values cause integer overflow when processed by downstream systems tracking collection supply? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory safety] Can oversized collection_name strings in BCS payload exceed memory limits, causing OOM conditions when multiple malicious events are processed simultaneously across the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] Does the error conversion from bcs::Error properly preserve error context, or can attackers exploit error suppression to hide malicious deserialization attempts from monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutateEvent] [Logic error] Can new_maximum be set to a value less than old_maximum, allowing attackers to artificially deflate collection supply caps and create scarcity manipulation attacks for financial gain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutateEvent] [Integer overflow] Can old_maximum or new_maximum be set to u64::MAX, causing arithmetic overflow in downstream supply tracking logic that calculates remaining mintable tokens (new_maximum - current_supply)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutateEvent] [Zero value exploit] Can new_maximum be set to 0 to permanently freeze a collection from minting new tokens, effectively conducting a griefing attack against legitimate collection creators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutateEvent] [String validation] Does collection_name undergo length validation, or can attackers emit events with extremely long strings (megabytes) causing storage bloat and indexer crashes when processing historical events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutateEvent] [Unicode exploit] Can collection_name contain malicious Unicode characters (null bytes, RTL overrides, homoglyphs) that cause parser confusion in indexers and frontends displaying collection mutation history? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Input validation] Does the constructor validate that new_maximum != old_maximum, or can attackers emit no-op mutation events to spam the event log and bloat chain storage without actual state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [AccountAddress validation] Does the constructor verify that creator_addr is not a system reserved address (0x0, 0x1), preventing system address spoofing in collection mutation events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [String sanitization] Does the constructor sanitize collection_name for control characters or empty strings that could break event indexing and querying systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Logic invariants] Does the constructor enforce business logic constraints like new_maximum > current_supply, or can events claim maximums below existing minted tokens causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Function: creator_addr()] [Reference safety] Does returning a reference to AccountAddress allow external mutation through unsafe code, enabling attackers to modify creator addresses in cached events post-emission?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type confusion] The STRUCT_NAME contains a typo 'CollectionMaxiumMutateEvent' - can attackers exploit this mismatch between Rust and Move struct names to conduct type substitution attacks and emit events under wrong type tags?
