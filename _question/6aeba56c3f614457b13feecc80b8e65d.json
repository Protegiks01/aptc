(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Function: TypeTag::from_str()] [Case sensitivity] Is the type tag parsing case-sensitive, or could an attacker create events with similar names like '0x1::randomness::randomnessGeneratedEvent' or '0x1::Randomness::RandomnessGeneratedEvent' to bypass event filtering in subscription services?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Module replacement] If governance allows upgrading the aptos_framework at 0x1, can replacing the randomness.move module with a modified version cause the cached TypeTag to become stale, leading to incorrect event filtering and randomness validation failures?
