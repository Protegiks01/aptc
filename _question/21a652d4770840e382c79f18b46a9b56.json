(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::to_bytes()] [Event handle cloning] Event handles are cloned into AccountResource - can modifications to original handles after to_bytes() cause desync between serialized and in-memory state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::to_bytes()] [BCS serialization determinism] Is BCS serialization guaranteed deterministic across all Rust compiler versions and platforms, or can platform differences cause state hash mismatches?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::to_writeset()] [WriteSet freeze panic] The unwrap() on freeze() can panic - can malformed write_set entries (duplicate keys, invalid ops) trigger this causing validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::to_writeset()] [Resource ordering] Does write_set maintain insertion order, or can reordering cause state application to fail or produce different final states? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_TIME] [Expiration calculation] Is this added to current timestamp or absolute time, and can timestamp overflow cause immediate expiration or never-expiring transactions? (Medium)",
