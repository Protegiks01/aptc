  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [License Fraud] Can malicious packages specify permissive licenses in the license field (line 91) while containing copyrighted code, creating legal liability for deployers without technical detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Unicode Homoglyph] Can package names or author fields use unicode homoglyphs (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' instead of Latin 'a') to create visually identical but technically different package identifiers for phishing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Version String Overflow] Can extremely long version strings (thousands of characters) in line 88 cause buffer overflows or DoS in version comparison logic used by the package manager? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Serialization Inconsistency] Does the serialization format change between Rust versions or serde versions, potentially causing manifest files to be interpreted differently across validator nodes running different software versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [BTreeMap Ordering] Can attackers exploit the ordering properties of BTreeMap in addresses/dependencies fields to cause deterministic execution differences across nodes with different locale or collation settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Optional Field Ambiguity] Do the skip_serializing_if annotations (lines 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80) create ambiguity where missing fields are indistinguishable from fields explicitly set to None, causing different security interpretations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Serde Rename Confusion] Can the serde rename attribute for 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' (lines 17, 20) be exploited to cause field name collisions or bypass access controls that check for hyphenated vs underscore field names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Duplicate Keys] Does serde's BTreeMap deserialization properly handle duplicate keys in addresses or dependencies, or can the last value silently override earlier values to bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a manifest with millions of entries in the BTreeMap fields (addresses, dependencies) causing out-of-memory conditions during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Vec Allocation] Can the authors vector (line 89) be exploited with an extremely large number of authors to cause excessive memory allocation and DoS during manifest parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [String Allocation] Can dependency fields (git, rev, subdir, aptos, address) containing extremely long strings (megabytes) cause memory exhaustion during deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Stack Overflow] If load_manifest_account_arg has recursive behavior, can deeply nested profile references in address strings cause stack overflow during the unwrap() call on line 62? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: From<ManifestNamedAddress> for Option<AccountAddress>] [Conversion Safety] Is the conversion on line 36-38 always safe, or can there be intermediate states where ManifestNamedAddress contains invalid data that gets converted to a seemingly valid Option<AccountAddress>? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: ManifestNamedAddress] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone derive on line 24 properly handle all edge cases, or can cloning a ManifestNamedAddress lead to shared mutable state bugs if AccountAddress has interior mutability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Debug Output] Does the Debug derive on line 13 expose sensitive information (private keys, internal addresses) in log files when manifests are printed during error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Field Interaction] Can the combination of multiple optional fields (local, git, aptos) create undefined behavior if more than one is set, leading to package system confusion about which source to use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Serialization Roundtrip] Is serialization-deserialization guaranteed to be lossless, or can certain manifest configurations lose information during roundtrip, causing deployed packages to differ from source manifests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Concurrent Access] If multiple threads deserialize the same manifest file simultaneously, can race conditions in BTreeMap population lead to inconsistent manifest state across threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between deserializing addresses and using them, where the address could be modified by another process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Mutation Safety] Are the public fields (package, addresses, dev_addresses, dependencies, dev_dependencies) on lines 15-21 safe to mutate after construction, or can mutation violate invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Import: load_manifest_account_arg] [External Dependency] Does the load_manifest_account_arg function from common/types module properly validate all inputs, or could its vulnerabilities be triggered through crafted manifest addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Import: AccountAddress] [Type Trust] Does the code assume AccountAddress from aptos_types is always valid, or could bugs in AccountAddress construction bypass manifest validation logic? (Medium)",
