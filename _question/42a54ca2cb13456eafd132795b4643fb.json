  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Vec allocation attack] Multiple Vec::with_capacity(weight) calls occur without upper bounds - can this be exploited to cause OOM by setting weights to maximum values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Clone safety] Does EncryptPubKey::clone() perform deep copying of all cryptographic material, or can shallow copying lead to unintended key material sharing that violates security assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_dealers()] [Dealer set validation] The get_dealers() function directly delegates to the inner transcript - can this return dealers that don't match the weighted configuration's player set, causing confusion about who actually dealt the transcript? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Player enumeration attack] The to_weighted_encryption_keys() loop uses player_id as enumerate index - can player IDs that don't match enumeration order cause encryption keys to be assigned to wrong players? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Player ordering dependency] Does the function assume players are ordered sequentially, and can gaps or reordering in player IDs cause keys to be duplicated incorrectly or assigned to wrong virtual players? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Player set mismatch] When verify() is called, is there validation that the spk and eks vectors match the player set in the WeightedConfig, or can mismatched player sets cause verification bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Struct: GenericWeighting<T>] [Type constraint violation] The WARNING states the wrapper is not secure for 'any PVSS scheme' - what properties must T have for security, and can instantiation with an inappropriate transcript type break all security guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Trait bounds] [Insufficient constraints] The trait bounds only require Transcript and specific subtrait combinations - are these sufficient to ensure T's security properties are maintained under key duplication, or do additional constraints need to be checked? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Generic parameter injection] Can an attacker instantiate GenericWeighting with a malicious transcript type T that implements required traits but has backdoored crypto operations to leak secrets during dealing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Impl blocks] [Type confusion] Multiple impl blocks assume T::SecretSharingConfig = ThresholdConfigBlstrs - can type mismatches between the weighted config and unweighted config cause runtime panics or security violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Auxiliary data injection] The aux parameter of generic type A is passed through without validation - can an attacker inject malicious auxiliary data that corrupts the transcript or bypasses verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Aux vector mismatch] The aux parameter is a Vec<A> but there's no check that its length matches the number of players - can size mismatches cause array out of bounds or incorrect validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Aux data consistency] When mauling signatures, is the aux data also updated consistently, or can stale aux data combined with new signatures create invalid transcript states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Generic type A] [Serialization attack] Since A only requires Serialize + Clone, can non-deterministic serialization of A cause different nodes to produce different transcript bytes, breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [RNG state manipulation] The rng parameter is used for dealing but passed through to inner transcript - can predictable RNG state be exploited through multiple calls to leak information about the secret? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG reuse attack] If generate() is called multiple times with the same RNG, can this lead to correlated transcripts that break security when aggregated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Generic R: RngCore + CryptoRng] [Weak RNG] Can an attacker provide a cryptographically weak RNG implementation that satisfies the trait bounds but produces predictable randomness, allowing transcript prediction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Replay attack] Is there any mechanism to prevent a previously valid transcript from being replayed in a new DKG ceremony, potentially allowing reuse of compromised secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Timestamp validation] There's no timestamp or epoch validation in verify() - can old transcripts from previous epochs be accepted in current epoch, potentially with compromised keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Concurrent aggregation] Can race conditions occur if multiple threads try to aggregate into the same transcript simultaneously, corrupting its state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Struct: GenericWeighting] [Missing synchronization] The struct doesn't use any synchronization primitives (Arc, Mutex) - can concurrent access to the inner trx field lead to data races in multi-threaded DKG ceremonies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Zero weight handling] If get_player_weight() returns 0 for a player, they receive no shares - can this be exploited to exclude players from reconstruction without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Empty share vector] If weight is 0, an empty Vec is returned - can code expecting non-empty vectors panic or behave incorrectly when processing zero-weight players? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Maximum weight limit] Is there an upper bound on player weights, and can weights approaching usize::MAX cause integer overflow in loop conditions or capacity calculations? (High)",
