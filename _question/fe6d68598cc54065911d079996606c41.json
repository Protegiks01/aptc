  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Access Control Bypass] Can a malicious actor exploit the async nature of request_can_bypass() to introduce race conditions where multiple concurrent bypass checks for the same request return inconsistent results, allowing unauthorized fund access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Authentication Bypass] Does the request_can_bypass() method properly validate that CheckerData hasn't been tampered with between creation and bypass checking, or can an attacker modify source_ip/headers mid-flight to gain unauthorized bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Error Handling] If request_can_bypass() returns an error Result, does the calling code default to allowing or denying bypass, and can an attacker trigger intentional errors to force a permissive failure mode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [State Inconsistency] Since request_can_bypass() is async, can concurrent requests from the same source cause inconsistent bypass decisions if the underlying allowlist/token list is being modified during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Fund Theft] If request_can_bypass() returns true, it bypasses ALL checkers and storage - can an attacker who gains bypass access drain the faucet by making unlimited concurrent requests without rate limiting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the serde deserialization of BypasserConfig to inject malicious configurations that point to attacker-controlled allowlist files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Type Confusion] Does the #[serde(tag = 'type')] deserialization properly validate the type field, or can an attacker craft a malformed config that causes type confusion between AuthToken and IpAllowlist bypassers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig::AuthToken] [Path Traversal] Can the ListManagerConfig file path in AuthToken variant be exploited for path traversal to read arbitrary files containing valid auth tokens from the filesystem? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig::IpAllowlist] [CIDR Manipulation] Can the IpRangeManagerConfig file path in IpAllowlist variant point to a file with maliciously crafted CIDR ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) that allow the entire internet to bypass checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Clone Safety] Since BypasserConfig implements Clone, can cloned configs share mutable state that could lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities when configs are modified? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Error Propagation] If AuthTokenBypasser::new() or IpAllowlistBypasser::new() fail during build(), does the error properly propagate, or can a panic/unwrap lead to DoS of the faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a BypasserConfig pointing to an extremely large allowlist file that causes memory exhaustion during AuthTokenBypasser::new() or IpAllowlistBypasser::new()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Between reading the config file during build() and using the bypasser, can an attacker replace the allowlist file to add their IP/token, exploiting a TOCTOU race condition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Initialization Race] If multiple threads call build() concurrently with the same config, can race conditions in ListManager or IpRangeManager initialization lead to inconsistent bypass state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [File Handle Leak] Does build() properly handle file descriptor limits when reading allowlist files, or can an attacker trigger repeated build() calls to exhaust file handles and DoS the service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser] [Enum Dispatch Bypass] Can the #[enum_dispatch(BypasserTrait)] macro be exploited to call the wrong bypasser implementation through type confusion or variant manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser] [Variant Exhaustiveness] If a new bypasser variant is added but not properly handled in all match statements, can this lead to unreachable code or default-allow bypass behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser::AuthTokenBypasser] [Multiple Bypassers] If multiple AuthTokenBypasser instances are configured, does the first match return true, or are all checked - can this lead to bypasses that shouldn't be allowed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser::IpAllowlistBypasser] [Priority Ordering] If both AuthTokenBypasser and IpAllowlistBypasser are configured, is there a defined priority order, or can an attacker exploit ordering ambiguity to bypass restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser] [Serialization Attack] Since Bypasser is an enum with From conversions, can an attacker exploit serialization to create a Bypasser variant that wasn't intended to be constructible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [JWT vs API Token Confusion] Does the bypasser properly distinguish between Firebase JWT tokens (with X_IS_JWT_HEADER) and API auth tokens, or can an attacker use a JWT to bypass when only API tokens should work? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Header Injection] Can an attacker inject both Authorization and X_IS_JWT_HEADER headers to confuse the auth token bypass logic and gain unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Token Extraction] Does the Authorization header parsing properly handle malformed 'Bearer <token>' formats, or can an attacker craft headers with extra whitespace/characters to bypass token validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Case Sensitivity] Is the auth token comparison case-sensitive, or can an attacker bypass checks by using different case variations of a valid token? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenBypasser] [Token Prefix] Does the bypasser validate that the Authorization header uses 'Bearer' prefix, or can attackers use other schemes like 'Basic' with valid tokens to bypass checks? (Low)"
