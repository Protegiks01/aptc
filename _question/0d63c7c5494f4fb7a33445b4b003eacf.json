  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache] [Unbounded Growth] Does UnsyncScriptCache have a maximum size limit, or can an attacker submit unlimited unique scripts to exhaust validator memory, causing OOM crashes and validator slashing? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage] [Double Storage] Since both script_cache and module_storage may cache overlapping data (scripts referencing modules), can an attacker exploit this duplication to cause excessive memory usage and validator performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Function: into_module_storage()] [Memory Leak] When into_module_storage() consumes self, does it properly drop the script_cache, or can an attacker cause memory leaks by repeatedly constructing and consuming UnsyncCodeStorage instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache] [Arc Cycle] Since Script contains Arc<CompiledScript> and Arc<Function>, can an attacker create reference cycles in the script_cache that prevent proper cleanup and cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage] [Clone Cost] Since UnsyncCodeStorage is not Clone, but its components use Arc, can an attacker exploit shared ownership to modify cached scripts across multiple storage instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage] [Thread Safety Violation] Since UnsyncCodeStorage is not Sync/Send, can an attacker exploit incorrect usage in multithreaded contexts (e.g., accidentally shared via unsafe code) to cause data races in script_cache access? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache using RefCell] [Borrow Checker Bypass] Does UnsyncScriptCache's internal RefCell properly enforce single-mutable-borrow semantics, or can an attacker trigger borrow_mut() panics during transaction execution by causing overlapping borrows? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Function: module_storage()] [Shared Reference Attack] When module_storage() returns &M, can an attacker hold this reference while mutating script_cache through ScriptCache methods, causing aliasing violations or inconsistent reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation pattern] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker exploit delegated trait methods to cause reentrancy where a ScriptCache method calls back into ModuleStorage methods, creating unexpected state modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage] [Sequential Consistency] In sequential execution contexts, can an attacker exploit the lack of synchronization to cause non-deterministic cache states when scripts and modules are loaded in different orders? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Generic constraint: M: ModuleStorage] [Trait Bound Violation] Can an attacker provide a ModuleStorage implementation that violates expected invariants (e.g., returns different modules for same ModuleId), causing cache inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: #[delegate]] [Macro Safety] Can the ambassador delegation macro introduce type confusion or incorrect trait forwarding that allows scripts to access module storage methods they shouldn't have permission to call? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache types] [Type Parameter Confusion] Since script_cache is parameterized with <[u8; 32], CompiledScript, Script>, can an attacker exploit type mismatches between deserialized CompiledScript and verified Script to cause execution errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Trait: NoOpLayoutCache] [Missing Implementation] Since UnsyncCodeStorage implements NoOpLayoutCache, does this mean layout caching is disabled, potentially causing validators to recompute layouts repeatedly and degrade performance? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Generic: M] [Variance Issues] Can an attacker exploit Rust's type variance rules to substitute an incompatible ModuleStorage type that bypasses security checks implemented in the expected storage type? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ScriptCache methods] [Error Propagation] When delegated ScriptCache methods encounter errors (e.g., deserialization failures), are errors properly propagated up, or can an attacker exploit error swallowing to cache invalid scripts? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ModuleStorage methods] [Error Inconsistency] If module_storage methods fail (VMResult::Err), can an attacker exploit partial failure states where script_cache is modified but module_storage updates are rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Function: new()] [Invalid Input] What happens if new() is called with a module_storage that's already in an inconsistent state—can this propagate corruption into the script_cache? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage] [Panic Safety] If a panic occurs during script execution (e.g., in bytecode interpreter), can an attacker exploit unwinding to leave script_cache in an inconsistent state with partially updated entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: all traits] [Panic in Delegated Methods] Can a panic in delegated trait methods (ScriptCache, ModuleStorage, WithRuntimeEnvironment) bypass cleanup logic and leave the UnsyncCodeStorage in a corrupted state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Function: assert_cached_state()] [Test Code Leakage] Although assert_cached_state() is marked #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'testing'))], can an attacker enable the 'testing' feature in production to bypass security checks or expose internal cache state? (Low)",
