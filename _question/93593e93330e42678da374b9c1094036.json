  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: new()] [Stream poisoning] Can an attacker obtain a reference to the ReceiverStream and inject malicious data, or close it prematurely to DoS the backup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Constant: TARGET_BATCH_SIZE] [Adaptive attack] Can an attacker analyze backup timing to infer the batch size and craft inputs that maximize buffer retention time, amplifying memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_bytes()] [Threshold boundary] Sending exactly TARGET_BATCH_SIZE (10240) bytes - does this trigger flush immediately or wait for the next byte causing off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_size_prefixed_bcs_bytes()] [Size boundary] Serializing a record of exactly u32::MAX bytes - does the size prefix wrap to 0 or is there proper error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_bytes()] [Empty buffer] Calling flush_buffer() when buffer.len() is 0 - does this send an empty Bytes object or skip the send operation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Constant: MAX_BATCHES] [Capacity boundary] Sending exactly 100 batches - is the last batch sent successfully or does it block waiting for channel space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: abort()] [Malicious error] Can an attacker craft an Error type with malicious Display implementation that causes format!() at line 87 to panic or consume excessive memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_res()] [Error amplification] If blocking_send() fails with a large error message, does wrapping it with AptosDbError::Other cause memory amplification through nested error chains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: abort()] [Error race] Can simultaneous calls to abort() with different errors cause only one error to propagate while others are lost, hiding attack evidence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_bytes()] [Bytes ownership] The bytes parameter is moved into extend() - can this cause issues if the caller expects to retain ownership for other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_size_prefixed_bcs_bytes()] [Temporary ownership] The buf.freeze() at line 66 consumes the BytesMut - is there any scenario where this temporary should be reused to avoid allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: finish()] [Self consumption] Consuming self at line 76 prevents further use - but if called through Rc/Arc, can multiple references exist causing use-after-move? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: send_size_prefixed_bcs_bytes()] [BackupHandler interaction] When used with BackupHandler iterators in handlers/mod.rs, can malformed iterator data cause serialization failures that aren't properly handled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: new()] [HTTP streaming] When the ReceiverStream is wrapped in hyper::Body, can HTTP connection drops cause channel closure without proper cleanup in BytesSender? (High)",
