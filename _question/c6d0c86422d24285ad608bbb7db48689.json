(Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Lock contention] If ConnectionManager's get_active_streams() acquires locks on the DashMap, and many concurrent status_page() requests occur during high stream activity, can this create lock contention that degrades indexer performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [build_html library] The file uses build_html crate at lines 9-12 for HTML generation - are there known vulnerabilities in this library (XSS, HTML injection, buffer overflows) that could be exploited through the with_raw(), with_attribute(), or with_table() methods? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [String injection] The end_version() string at line 79 is displayed without validation - can an attacker inject newlines, null bytes, or Unicode control characters that break HTML structure or cause rendering issues?
