  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Version Casting Overflow] Can the version.0 as i64 casts at lines 537 and 540 overflow if version numbers exceed i64::MAX, causing negative version numbers in the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Index Casting Overflow] Can the index as i64 cast at line 546 overflow if WriteSetChange vectors have more than i64::MAX elements, causing negative indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Enumerate Overflow] Can the enumerate() call at line 545 overflow if the changes vector is extremely large, causing index wraparound? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Async Transaction Safety] Is the async function process_transactions() at line 478 safe to call concurrently with overlapping version ranges, or can race conditions corrupt the database?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: insert_current_table_items()] [Deadlock Risk] Despite sorting at line 589, can the conditional WHERE clause at line 400 still cause deadlocks if multiple transactions update overlapping table items? (High)",
