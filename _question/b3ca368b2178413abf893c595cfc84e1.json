  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall design] [Pool lifetime management] If SymbolPool is long-lived across multiple Move module compilations, can stale symbols from old modules interfere with new module compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall design] [Thread-safety assumption] Is SymbolPool intended to be thread-safe when wrapped in Arc, or does it require external synchronization that might be missing in calling code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall design] [Memory leak prevention] Does SymbolPool implement Drop to ensure proper cleanup, or can pools leak memory if they contain circular Rc references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Empty string handling] Can make(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Maximum string length] Is there a limit on string length passed to make(), or can arbitrarily long strings be interned causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Symbol 0 special case] Does Symbol(0) represent a valid first interned string, or is it reserved as invalid/null symbol causing confusion in error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Return value caching] Since string() returns Rc::clone(), can this cause memory overhead if symbols are looked up repeatedly without caching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall] [Unsafe code audit] Does this file contain any unsafe blocks that bypass Rust's safety guarantees, potentially introducing memory corruption vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall] [Send/Sync bounds] Is SymbolPool marked Send or Sync, and if shared across threads, do the RefCell internals violate thread-safety assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall] [Panic safety] Are all operations panic-safe in that SymbolPool remains in consistent state even if borrow() or borrow_mut() panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall] [Integer arithmetic] Are there any unchecked integer operations that could overflow on 32-bit systems where usize is smaller? (Low)"
