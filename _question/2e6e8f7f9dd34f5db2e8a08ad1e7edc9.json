  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Client Building Race] If get_api_client() is called concurrently from multiple threads, can race conditions in ClientBuilder::new() cause issues with shared system resources (connection pools, DNS resolver)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [SocketAddr Manipulation] After DNS resolution, the code takes socket_addrs[0] and modifies its port - can an attacker exploit the array indexing to cause out-of-bounds access if socket_addrs is empty (despite the check)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [NetworkAddress Injection] The NetworkAddress::from(socket_addr).append_prod_protos() chain on line 158 - can an attacker exploit the prod_protos format to inject malicious protocol parameters or bypass Noise authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Protocol Version Hardcoding] The append_prod_protos() uses hardcoded version 0 - if this version is deprecated or vulnerable, can an attacker exploit it to break into validator connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Multiple Address Warning] When multiple SocketAddrs are returned, the code warns but proceeds - can an attacker use this warning to spam logs and hide other malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_url()] [Empty Path Injection] If the path parameter is empty string '', does set_path('') clear the path or cause unexpected behavior? Can this be exploited to access root endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_url()] [Absolute Path Override] If path starts with '/', does set_path() treat it as absolute, potentially overriding the base URL path and accessing unintended endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_url()] [Context Error String] The context message on line 77 says 'Can't build API URL without an API port' - can an attacker exploit error message confusion if this error is logged and parsed by monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_url()] [Wrong Error Message] Line 87 says 'Can't build metrics URL without a metrics port' but checks api_port - does this error message confusion help attackers hide the port confusion bug? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Error Message Confusion] Line 102 checks metrics_port but the error says 'Cannot build metrics client without a metrics port' - is this consistent with get_metrics_url() which uses api_port? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Debug Trait Information Disclosure] The struct derives Debug - when logged or printed for debugging, does it expose sensitive information like public keys, internal URLs, or cookie data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [DNS Resolution Timing] The socket_addrs() call blocks for DNS resolution - can an attacker use timing attacks to infer information about internal DNS configuration or network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Error Message Information Leak] Error messages include URL and resolution details - can these leak sensitive information about validator network topology, internal IP addresses, or domain names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Client Proliferation] Each call creates a new reqwest::Client with cookie_store - can repeated calls exhaust memory or connection resources, especially if cookies accumulate in the shared Jar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Connection Pool Exhaustion] Does each AptosRestClient create its own connection pool?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [DNS Query Amplification] Can an attacker provide domains with many DNS records to cause socket_addrs() to allocate large amounts of memory processing the results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Option None Handling] Multiple fields are Option types - can None values in api_port, metrics_port, noise_port, or public_key cause unexpected behavior in code paths that don't properly check for None? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [SocketAddr Type Confusion] The code handles both IPv4 and IPv6 SocketAddrs - can an attacker exploit type confusion between address families to bypass IP filtering or cause incorrect NetworkAddress construction?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Arc Reference Counting] The cookie_store is Arc<Jar> - can reference counting issues (dropping the Arc while requests are in-flight) cause use-after-free or memory safety violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [AptosRestClient Integration] The function returns AptosRestClient initialized with get_api_url() - can errors in URL construction propagate into the AptosRestClient causing authentication bypass or API misuse?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Metrics Endpoint Attack] Since metrics endpoints often expose sensitive operational data, can the bug in get_metrics_url() (using wrong port) be exploited to redirect metrics collection to malicious endpoints that exfiltrate validator performance data?
