  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_write_or_flush()] [Flush Failure] When socket.poll_flush() fails at line 329, does the WriteState properly reset, or can this cause subsequent writes to be lost or duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_write_all()] [Offset Overflow] Can the offset parameter overflow when incremented at line 455, causing writes to start from the wrong position in the buffer? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_write_all()] [WriteZero Handling] When poll_write returns n == 0 at line 451, does this always indicate a WriteZero error, or could this be a legitimate temporary condition? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read_u16frame_len()] [EOF Detection] At line 481, does the logic correctly distinguish between graceful EOF (Ok(None)) and unexpected EOF (Err), or can an attacker exploit this to cause connection state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read_exact()] [Infinite Loop] At line 503, can an attacker cause poll_read to continuously return Poll::Pending without making progress, leading to an infinite loop and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read_exact()] [UnexpectedEof Timing] When n == 0 at line 507, does immediately returning UnexpectedEof allow an attacker to distinguish between different error conditions through timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Struct: NoiseBuffers] [Memory Zeroing] When NoiseBuffers is dropped, are the buffers properly zeroed to prevent sensitive data from remaining in memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Enum: NoiseHandshakeError] [Information Disclosure] Do error messages at lines 15-82 leak sensitive information about the server's configuration, trusted peers, or internal state that could aid attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Function: should_security_log()] [Detection Evasion] Does the function only flag ServerReplayDetected errors for security logging, allowing other security-critical errors to go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Error: InvalidClientPeerId] [Hex Encoding] When encoding the invalid peer_id as hex, can this consume excessive memory if the peer_id is maliciously crafted to be extremely large? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Error: ClientExpectingDifferentPubkey] [Timing Attack] Does returning detailed public key information in error messages enable timing attacks to distinguish between authentication failures? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Error: UnexpectedError] [Generic Wrapping] Does wrapping application errors as UnexpectedError hide important security context that should be preserved for proper error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Integration: PeersAndMetadata] [Concurrent Modification] Can the peers_and_metadata Arc be modified concurrently during handshakes, causing race conditions where peers are authenticated against an outdated trusted set? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Integration: NetworkContext] [Context Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the network_context to change the network_id or role during a handshake, bypassing authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Integration: NoiseConfig] [Key Reuse] Does the noise_config reuse the same static private key across all connections, potentially allowing key compromise if the ephemeral key RNG is weak? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Integration: OsRng] [RNG Failure] If OsRng fails to provide random bytes for ephemeral key generation, does the code properly detect and handle this failure, or can it lead to cryptographic weaknesses? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Integration: Socket] [Socket Reuse] Can an attacker reuse a socket that has already completed a handshake, potentially bypassing authentication on subsequent connections? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Integration: AsyncRead/AsyncWrite] [Cancellation Safety] If a read or write operation is cancelled mid-execution, does this leave the NoiseStream in a consistent state, or can it cause data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Crypto: Noise IK] [Handshake Pattern] Does the Noise IK pattern implementation properly follow the specification, or could deviations introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Crypto: DH] [Weak DH] Can an attacker force the use of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters by manipulating the handshake, potentially enabling compromise of session keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Crypto: Static Keys] [Key Rotation] Are static x25519 keys rotated periodically, or does long-term use of the same key increase vulnerability to key compromise? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Crypto: AEAD] [Nonce Reuse] Does the noise session properly manage nonces to prevent reuse, or can an attacker exploit nonce reuse to break encryption? (Critical)",
