  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Integer overflow] Can a malicious Move module define an error constant with a BigInt value exceeding u64::MAX, causing the u64::try_from() conversion to fail and crash the build process, potentially creating a DoS against the build system? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker define error constants with non-Number Value types (e.g., Address, Vector, Struct) to bypass the match statement and trigger the bail!() error path, potentially injecting arbitrary error messages into build logs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Error handling] Does the u64::try_from conversion properly handle negative BigInt values, or could a malicious constant with a negative value bypass validation and cause undefined behavior in downstream error code processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Panic safety] If the u64::try_from fails, does the error propagation via map_err properly clean up any partial state in the ErrorMapping output, or could repeated failures leave corrupted error map data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Error collision] Can an attacker define multiple constants with the same abort code value in the 'error' module, causing add_error_category() to return an error, and does this error properly halt the build or could it be silently ignored leading to incomplete error maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Error collision] If multiple constants in different modules use the same error code prefix and value, does add_module_error() detect and prevent collisions, or could this create ambiguous error mappings that confuse runtime error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [State corruption] If add_error_category() fails halfway through processing the error module due to a duplicate code, is the ErrorMapping output left in a partially constructed state that could be written to disk by save_result()? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [State corruption] Can concurrent or repeated calls to add_module_error() with the same module name and error code cause race conditions or state corruption in the ErrorMapping data structure? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Module spoofing] Can a malicious actor create a fake module at address 0x1 named 'error' to inject arbitrary error categories, bypassing the intended error category module check and poisoning the global error map? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Address validation] Does the check 'Address::Numerical(AccountAddress::ONE)' properly validate that only the legitimate standard library error module can define error categories, or could an attacker use Address::Named or other address types to bypass this check? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Module name collision] If the error_category_module option is set to a custom name, can an attacker create a module with that exact name to override error categories, and is there validation that the custom module is at a trusted address? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [String comparison] Is the string comparison for module name 'error' case-sensitive and does it properly handle Unicode or special characters that could allow homograph attacks (e.g., 'еrror' with Cyrillic 'e')? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Path traversal] Can a malicious ErrmapOptions::output_file contain path traversal sequences like '../../../etc/passwd' allowing the error map to overwrite arbitrary files on the build system? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Symlink attack] If output_file is a symlink to a sensitive system file, does to_file() follow the symlink and overwrite the target, potentially compromising the build environment? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Permission escalation] Does save_result() create the output file with secure permissions, or could it create world-writable files that allow other processes to tamper with error mappings? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU race condition between checking if the output file exists and writing to it, where an attacker could replace the file with a symlink between these operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Disk space exhaustion] Does to_file() have size limits or disk quota checks, or could a malicious error map with millions of entries exhaust disk space and crash the build system? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Code injection] Are constant names and documentation properly sanitized before being added to ErrorDescription, or could special characters, newlines, or format strings cause injection attacks in downstream tools that read the error map? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: name_string()] [Unicode handling] Does symbol_pool().string() properly handle Unicode characters in constant names, or could malformed UTF-8 sequences cause panics or buffer overflows when processing error names?
