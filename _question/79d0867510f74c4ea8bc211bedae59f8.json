  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Move Integration] [Stack Overflow] Can deeply nested multiplication calls cause Move VM stack overflow before hitting memory limits, bypassing security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Move Integration] [Bytecode Injection] Can malicious Move bytecode inject invalid calls to mul_internal with crafted arguments that bypass Move verifier checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Handles] [Handle Collision] Can two different AlgebraContext sessions generate colliding handles, allowing cross-session element access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Handles] [Handle Prediction] Are handles predictable (sequential counter), allowing attackers to guess valid handles and access elements they shouldn't have access to? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Handles] [Handle Lifetime] After a transaction completes, are handles properly invalidated, or can they be reused in subsequent transactions causing state pollution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Handles] [Handle Overflow] When the handle counter reaches usize::MAX, does it overflow to 0 causing handle collisions and security breaches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Handles] [Handle Type Confusion] Can an attacker obtain a handle from one operation (e.g., deserialization) and use it in mul_internal with a different type, bypassing type safety? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Concurrency] [Read-Write Conflict] Can mul_internal's read of element_1/element_2 and write of new_element conflict in parallel execution, causing incorrect validation and rollback? (High)",
