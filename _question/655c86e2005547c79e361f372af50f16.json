  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: BurnTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Burn-Mint Symmetry] Do BurnTranslator and MintTranslator use identical logic for FixedSupply vs UnlimitedSupply detection, or can asymmetries cause burn events to use different keys than corresponding mint events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: BurnTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Double Burn Protection] Can an attacker emit multiple Burn events for the same token in the same transaction, and does the sequence number logic prevent duplicate burn event recording?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: TokenWithdrawTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Withdraw Without Deposit] Can the sequence number logic ensure withdraws only occur after corresponding deposits, or can attackers create withdraw events that appear to extract tokens from empty accounts? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: MutatePropertyMapTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Type String Parsing] Are the type strings in mutate.types() validated before cloning, or can malicious type strings exploit parsers downstream? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: MintTokenTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Collections Resource Confusion] Does the translator ensure the Collections resource belongs to the actual creator and not a spoofed address that happens to have a Collections resource?
