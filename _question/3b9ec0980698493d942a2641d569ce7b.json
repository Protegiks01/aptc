  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Gas errors] [GasEstimationFailed retry loop] Since GasEstimationFailed is retriable, can transactions that consistently fail gas estimation (e.g., due to contract bugs) cause infinite retry loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Node state] [NodeIsOffline timing] Can the NodeIsOffline error be used to fingerprint node restart times and target nodes during vulnerable startup periods? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Node state] [VersionPruned vs BlockPruned] Are VersionPruned and BlockPruned handled consistently, or can pruning inconsistencies cause clients to fail when requesting historical data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Node state] [TransactionIsPending timing] Can repeated TransactionIsPending errors be used to infer mempool processing times and potentially predict transaction confirmation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Security] [Error enumeration attack] Can an attacker systematically trigger all error types to map out the API surface and identify edge cases for exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Security] [Error message parsing] Can clients parse error messages to extract structured data, and if so, can changes to message formats break client implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Security] [RejectedByFilter details] What information does RejectedByFilter include in details, and can this reveal transaction filter rules that attackers could bypass? (Medium)"
