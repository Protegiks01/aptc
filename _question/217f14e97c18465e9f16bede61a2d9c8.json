  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/context.rs] [Field: legacy_enable_incremental_gas_charging] [Toggle exploitation] Can the incremental charging flag at line 48 be toggled mid-execution to bypass gas checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Legacy budget check] At line 93, legacy_gas_budget() is checked - is this budget consistently enforced across all legacy code paths, or can it be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Production panic] Can the assertions at lines 123-124 and 139 be triggered in production, causing validator crashes and network liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Assert timing] If assertions fire after state changes but before commit, can they cause partial state updates leading to corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_named_natives()] [Name collision] Can attackers register multiple natives with the same name, causing the wrong function to be called or overwriting legitimate natives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_named_natives()] [Namespace pollution] At line 191, native names are converted to String - can special characters or namespace prefixes be exploited to shadow system natives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/context.rs] [Function: abs_val_gas_params()] [Parameter substitution] At line 166, can the returned AbstractValueSizeGasParameters be modified through unsafe code after return, affecting subsequent calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/context.rs] [Function: gas_feature_version()] [Version inconsistency] At line 171, is the returned version guaranteed to be consistent with the actual behavior, or can version mismatches cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError::Abort] [Abort code exhaustion] Can attackers use all abort codes to encode arbitrary data, bypassing transaction validation or encoding malicious payloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: LimitExceededError] [Error classification] Can the distinction between different limit types at lines 20-27 be exploited to cause inconsistent error handling across validators? (Medium)"
