  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: BoundedExecutor::new()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker pass usize::MAX as capacity to BoundedExecutor::new(), causing integer overflow in Semaphore::new() and allowing unlimited task spawning that exhausts validator node resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: BoundedExecutor::new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker create a BoundedExecutor with capacity=0, causing all spawn() calls to deadlock indefinitely since acquire_permit().await will never succeed, potentially freezing critical consensus or execution paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: BoundedExecutor::new()] [Denial of Service] If multiple BoundedExecutors are created with very large capacities across different Aptos components, can this cause memory exhaustion on validator nodes by allocating excessive Semaphore permits, leading to node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: BoundedExecutor::new()] [Configuration Attack] Can malicious node operators modify configuration to set unreasonably low capacity values for critical executors (e.g., transaction execution, consensus), causing artificial bottlenecks that degrade network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Memory Leak] Does the Arc<Semaphore> in BoundedExecutor create reference cycles when cloned across multiple spawned tasks, potentially causing memory leaks that accumulate over time on long-running validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Panic Vulnerability] The acquire_permit() function calls unwrap() on the Semaphore::acquire_owned() result - can this panic if the semaphore is closed, causing validator node crashes during critical operations like block execution or consensus voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Async Cancellation] If a task calling spawn() is cancelled while awaiting acquire_permit(), does the permit get properly released back to the semaphore, or can this lead to permit leaks that gradually reduce available capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Deadlock] Can concurrent calls to spawn() from multiple async contexts create a deadlock scenario where all permits are held by tasks waiting for other resources, freezing the executor and causing liveness failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Priority Inversion] Does the FIFO ordering of Semaphore permit acquisition allow low-priority tasks to block high-priority consensus or execution tasks, potentially causing validator performance degradation or missed block proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Resource Starvation] If malicious actors flood the executor with long-running tasks, can they starve legitimate operations by monopolizing all permits, preventing critical blockchain operations like transaction validation or state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_acquire_permit()] [Race Condition] Between checking try_acquire_permit() returning Some and actually spawning the task, can another thread consume the permit, leading to inconsistent state where the executor believes it has capacity but tasks fail to spawn? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_acquire_permit()] [Error Handling] Does try_acquire_permit() properly handle the case where the semaphore is closed or poisoned, or will it return Ok(permit) even in error states, leading to undefined behavior in task spawning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Permit Leak on Panic] If the spawned future panics before the permit is dropped in future_with_permit(), does the permit get properly released, or is it leaked permanently, gradually reducing executor capacity over time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Executor Shutdown] If the underlying tokio Handle's runtime is shut down while spawn() is executing, can this cause panics or undefined behavior that crashes validator nodes during graceful shutdown sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Task Injection] Can an attacker control the Future parameter passed to spawn() to inject malicious async code that executes with validator privileges, potentially exfiltrating private keys or manipulating consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Unbounded Growth] Although spawn() blocks on permit acquisition, can the queue of waiting spawn() calls grow unbounded, consuming memory and eventually causing OOM on validator nodes during high transaction load? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [JoinHandle Leak] If callers spawn tasks but never await the returned JoinHandle, do the task results accumulate in memory, causing gradual resource exhaustion on long-running validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Cancellation Safety] If a spawned task holds the permit but is cancelled before completion, is the permit properly released, or can cancellation cause permit leaks that reduce available capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Reentrancy] Can a spawned task recursively call spawn() on the same BoundedExecutor, potentially causing nested permit acquisition that leads to deadlock or stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Error Path Permit Leak] In the Err(future) return path when no permit is available, is there any scenario where a permit was partially acquired but not released, causing subtle permit leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [TOCTOU Race] Between try_acquire_permit() succeeding and executor.spawn() being called, can the executor runtime be shut down or poisoned, causing spawn() to fail while the permit is already consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Capacity Bypass] Can an attacker repeatedly call try_spawn() in a tight loop to detect when permits become available and monopolize capacity before legitimate high-priority tasks can acquire permits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Resource Management] If try_spawn() returns Err(future), does the caller properly handle the returned future, or can improper handling lead to resource leaks or dropped critical tasks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Fairness Violation] Does try_spawn() allow tasks to skip the queue compared to spawn(), potentially allowing attackers to starve waiting spawn() calls by continuously succeeding with try_spawn()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Thread Pool Exhaustion] Can spawn_blocking() exhaust the tokio blocking thread pool independently of the semaphore limit, causing validator nodes to run out of threads and crash? (High)"
