  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [External Integration] If checker_name is used as a key in downstream systems (databases, caches), can name collisions or injection attacks via special characters cause data corruption or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Link Usage] If the links field is used to auto-generate documentation or clickable remediation steps, can malicious links lead to credential phishing or malware distribution targeting node operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: new()] [Default Links] CheckResult::new() initializes links to empty Vec - is there a use case where default links should be populated with generic documentation, or can empty links cause confusion for operators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [No Builder Pattern] Only links() uses builder pattern, but no builders for other fields - should there be a full builder to enforce validation constraints at construction time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information Leakage] Both structs derive Debug which may log sensitive information if checker results contain internal system details - can Debug output be exploited to gather reconnaissance for attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckSummary] [No Timestamps] CheckSummary lacks timestamp or version information - can stale health results be confused with current ones, causing operators to act on outdated information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [No Priority] All checks are treated equally in aggregation with no priority/severity field - can critical security checks be diluted by numerous low-importance checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [u32 to u8 Cast] After division, result is cast from u32 to u8 via 'as u8' which is a saturating cast - if somehow the division result exceeds 255, it would saturate at 255 - is this the intended behavior or could it hide calculation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Sum Overflow Check] The sum of u8 scores cast to u32 assumes this won't overflow u32::MAX, but with ~42 million checks all scored at 100, overflow is possible - is there defensive overflow checking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Threshold Boundary] A summary_score of exactly 95 gets 'Good!' but 96 gets 'Awesome!' - can manipulation to score exactly 95 vs 96 have meaningful impact on automated decision systems that use these thresholds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Wildcard Match] The final match arm uses 'wildcard' pattern for scores ≤50 - is there significance to naming it 'wildcard' vs '_', and could this pattern matching have edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Validator Selection] If these health check results are used for validator selection or stake delegation, can attackers manipulate scores to appear healthy when they're not, potentially becoming validators despite being unreliable or malicious? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Network Monitoring] If the node checker is used to monitor consensus health and these types aggregate that data, can score manipulation hide consensus issues that could lead to network instability or safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Automated Actions] If automated systems (like load balancers or failover mechanisms) use summary_score to make decisions, can score manipulation cause improper routing of traffic to unhealthy nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Score Definition] What does a score of 0 vs 100 actually mean? Is 0 complete failure or just low performance? Lack of specification could cause inconsistent implementations across different checkers. (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Headline Format] No specification for headline format - should it be a short summary, an error code, or free text? Inconsistency could impact parsing by downstream systems. (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Explanation Length] No guidance on explanation length - should it be a tweet-length summary or a detailed report? Very long explanations could cause UI/UX issues. (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Algorithm Change] The comment 'Very basic for now, we likely want a trait for this' suggests the aggregation will change - can the current simple average create dependencies that will break when weighted averaging is implemented? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckSummary] [Future Extensibility] Adding new fields to CheckSummary (like weighted scores or check categories) could break serialization compatibility - is there a versioning strategy? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Combined Attack] [Score Manipulation Chain] Can an attacker combine multiple vulnerabilities - inject invalid scores >100, provide empty check_results for 100 score, and add crafted checker names - to completely subvert health monitoring and hide a compromised validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Combined Attack] [Resource Exhaustion Chain] Can an attacker chain attacks by creating massive check_results Vecs with huge explanation strings and millions of links, then repeatedly triggering serialization to cause cascading DoS across the monitoring infrastructure? (High)"
