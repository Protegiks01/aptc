  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Deletion ordering issue] Does remove_certified_aug_data() have any ordering requirements with remove_aug_data(), and can wrong ordering cause state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Recovery corruption] Can crashes during remove_certified_aug_data() leave storage in partially-cleaned state that causes incorrect augmented data loading on validator restart? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Bulk deletion performance] Can remove_certified_aug_data() be called with extremely large Vec parameters causing performance spikes that disrupt consensus participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Silent error propagation] Can remove_certified_aug_data() encounter deletion errors but not properly surface them to callers, leading to assumption that cleanup succeeded when it didn't? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Storage leak over epochs] If remove_certified_aug_data() is called incorrectly or not at all during epoch transitions, can certified augmented data accumulate indefinitely causing storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Implementation variation] Can different implementations of RandStorage trait have inconsistent semantics (e.g., in-memory vs persistent DB) that cause validators using different implementations to diverge in their augmented data state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Generic type safety] Can the generic type parameter D in RandStorage<D> be instantiated with incompatible types, causing runtime failures or type confusion when augmented data is serialized/deserialized? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Send+Sync safety] Does the Send + Sync + 'static bound on RandStorage truly guarantee thread safety, or can implementations have hidden shared mutable state that causes race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Error handling inconsistency] Can implementations return anyhow::Result with different error types/messages for the same failure conditions, causing inconsistent error handling in callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Epoch transition atomicity] Can the sequence of save/get/remove calls during epoch transitions leave RandStorage in inconsistent state if validator crashes mid-transition? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Missing validation requirements] Does RandStorage trait specify what validation implementations MUST perform before persisting data, or can implementations skip critical checks like signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Concurrent access semantics] Are the concurrency semantics of RandStorage trait methods clearly defined, or can implementations make different assumptions about concurrent save/get/remove operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Recovery guarantees] Does RandStorage trait specify recovery guarantees (e.g., if save_aug_data succeeds, data must survive crashes), or can implementations have weak durability that loses data on crash? (High)"
