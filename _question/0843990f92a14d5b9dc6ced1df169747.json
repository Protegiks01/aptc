  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::new()] [Event collision] Can an attacker create two different events with the same EventKey by reusing the same creation_number and account_address combination, leading to event stream conflicts and potential state confusion across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::new()] [Integer overflow] Does creation_number validate against u64::MAX, or can an attacker cause integer overflow by incrementing beyond maximum value, wrapping back to 0 and creating duplicate EventKeys that conflict with earlier events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::new()] [Account spoofing] Can a malicious actor forge EventKeys for another account_address by manipulating the creation_number field, potentially subscribing to or interfering with events they shouldn't have access to? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Struct: EventKey] [Global uniqueness] Is there validation ensuring that the combination of creation_number and account_address is globally unique across all validators, or can Byzantine validators create conflicting EventKeys causing consensus disagreement? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::new()] [Creation number manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate creation_number to be non-sequential (skipping numbers), potentially causing event ordering issues or gaps in event streams that break client assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::to_bytes()] [Serialization determinism] Does BCS serialization guarantee deterministic byte representation across different Rust compiler versions and architectures, or can non-determinism cause validators to compute different event identifiers leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::to_bytes()] [Panics and unwrap] The unwrap() call on bcs::to_bytes() will panic if serialization fails - can an attacker craft malformed EventKey data that triggers panic during serialization, causing validator crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::to_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker cause excessive memory allocation during to_bytes() serialization by manipulating EventKey fields to produce unexpectedly large byte arrays, leading to OOM conditions on validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::to_bytes()] [Collision attacks] Does the BCS encoding scheme prevent collision attacks where two different EventKey instances produce identical byte representations, potentially allowing event substitution or replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::to_bytes()] [Endianness issues] Is the byte encoding endianness-safe across different validator node architectures (x86, ARM), or can endianness differences cause identical EventKeys to serialize differently creating consensus splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creator_address()] [Creator verification bypass] Can a malicious validator fabricate events claiming to originate from a different account_address by forging the EventKey structure, bypassing Move's resource ownership model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creator_address()] [System account impersonation] Can an attacker create EventKeys with system account addresses (0x0, 0x1) to emit privileged events that should only come from framework modules, potentially manipulating governance or staking state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creator_address()] [Cross-account event pollution] Is there validation preventing an account from emitting events with EventKeys referencing other accounts' addresses, which could pollute event streams or confuse indexers tracking specific accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creation_number()] [Sequence number gaps] Can creation_number have gaps or non-sequential values that break assumptions about event ordering, causing event stream processing logic to fail or skip events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creation_number()] [Creation number reuse] Is there protection against creation_number reuse after account deletion and recreation, which could cause new events to collide with historical events from the deleted account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::get_creation_number()] [Overflow detection] Does the getter properly handle u64::MAX values without causing downstream integer overflow in code that increments or compares creation numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::random()] [Production leakage] Can the random() function marked for testing accidentally be enabled in production builds through feature flag misconfiguration, allowing creation of unpredictable EventKeys that break determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::random()] [Weak randomness] Does OsRng provide cryptographically secure randomness, or can predictable random values be exploited in test environments to create known EventKey collisions for testing attacks that work in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::random()] [AccountAddress::random() correlation] Does the combination of random creation_number and AccountAddress::random() ensure true independence, or can correlated randomness create collision vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::size()] [Size mismatch] Does the hardcoded size calculation (8 + 32 bytes) match the actual BCS serialization size, or can discrepancies cause buffer overflows or underflows in code relying on this size? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::size()] [Padding and alignment] Does BCS serialization add padding bytes that aren't accounted for in the size() calculation, causing memory allocation errors or data corruption in storage systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventKey::size()] [Storage accounting] Can incorrect size calculation lead to storage quota bypasses where attackers create events that consume more space than charged for, causing storage exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Impl: fmt::LowerHex for EventKey] [Format string injection] Can malicious EventKey values be crafted to inject format string exploits through the hex formatting logic, potentially causing crashes or information leaks in logging systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Impl: fmt::LowerHex for EventKey] [Display inconsistency] Does the hex formatting produce the same string across all validators, or can subtle formatting differences (0x prefix handling) cause event identifier mismatches in logs and APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Impl: fmt::Display for EventKey] [Canonicalization issues] Can different string representations of the same EventKey be created through display formatting variations, causing event stream indexing errors or query mismatches? (Medium)"
