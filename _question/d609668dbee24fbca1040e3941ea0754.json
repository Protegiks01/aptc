  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Signature bypass] Can an attacker use swap to exchange signed data with unsigned data after signature verification, bypassing authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Random number manipulation] If swap is used on random number generator state, can an attacker exploit this to predict or manipulate randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Empty container swap] Can swapping empty containers (zero-length vectors, empty structs) cause integer underflow or division by zero in size calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Maximum size value swap] Can an attacker swap maximum-sized values (u256::MAX, 256-element vectors) to trigger integer overflow in size calculations or exceed memory limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Null reference handling] Does safely_pop_arg! properly reject null or uninitialized references, or can an attacker pass null references to cause null pointer dereferences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Circular reference] Can an attacker create circular reference structures (A refs B, B refs A) and use swap to create infinite loops during traversal or marking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Registration attack] The make_all function at lines 58-63 registers the native function - can an attacker exploit the SafeNativeBuilder to register malicious implementations or override existing registrations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Function pointer manipulation] The RawSafeNative function pointer cast at line 61 - can an attacker manipulate function pointers to redirect swap calls to malicious implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Iterator exhaustion] The make_all function returns an iterator - can exhausting or double-consuming this iterator cause registration failures or duplicate registrations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Return value bypass] The function returns smallvec![] (empty) at line 52 - can an attacker exploit expectations about return values to cause type confusion in the calling context? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [SmallVec optimization bypass] SmallVec avoids heap allocation for small vectors - can an attacker exploit the small/large threshold to cause performance degradation or allocation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Vector::swap coordination] The std::vector module uses mem::swap internally - can an attacker exploit inconsistencies between vector::swap and mem::swap to cause vector corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Move_range interaction] The vector::move_range function also uses native memory operations - can combining swap and move_range in clever ways cause memory safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Non-deterministic behavior] Can differences in Rust's mem::swap implementation across platforms (x86 vs ARM, different OS) cause non-deterministic swap behavior, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
