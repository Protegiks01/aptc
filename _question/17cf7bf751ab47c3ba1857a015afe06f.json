  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Trait: Deserialize for TBlockEndInfoExt] [Incomplete deserialization] Deserialize always creates empty to_make_hot BTreeSet - does this mean hot state information is never persisted, and can this be exploited to reset cache state arbitrarily? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Trait: Arbitrary for TBlockEndInfoExt] [Fuzzing limitation] The Arbitrary implementation always creates empty to_make_hot for consistency with serialization - does this mean hot state logic is never fuzz-tested, potentially hiding bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Version migration] [Downgrade attack] Can a byzantine validator force downgrade from V1 to V0 BlockEpiloguePayload to skip fee distribution, causing validators to not receive their earned fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Version migration] [Upgrade timing] During protocol upgrade from V0 to V1, can there be a window where some validators process V1 payloads while others expect V0, causing consensus failure and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Version migration] [Feature flag bypass] If V1 is enabled via feature flag, can validators still accept V0 payloads to bypass new fee distribution requirements, enabling economic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: block_id] [Hash collision] Can block_id HashValue collisions be exploited to make validators accept two different blocks with the same ID, causing double-execution or consensus confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: block_id] [Preimage attack] If block_id is predictable or can be precomputed, can an attacker craft transactions that match future block IDs to cause validation or execution issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: block_id] [Zero hash] Is HashValue::zero() a valid block_id, and can this be exploited as a sentinel value that bypasses certain checks or causes null pointer-like behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Borsh vs BCS] If different serialization formats (Borsh/BCS) are used in different contexts, can format confusion attacks occur where a payload serialized in one format is deserialized in another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Malformed enum] Can a crafted byte sequence deserialize to an invalid enum variant that doesn't match V0/V1/V0, causing pattern match exhaustion or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Size bomb] Can deeply nested or large serialized BlockEpiloguePayload (especially with large BTreeMap in FeeDistribution) cause deserialization to consume excessive memory or CPU? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: FeeDistribution::amount] [BTreeMap ordering] Does BTreeMap ordering of validator indices affect fee distribution order, and can this be exploited if payment processing is not atomic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: FeeDistribution::amount] [Empty map] Can an empty BTreeMap be provided for fee distribution, causing all fees to be burned/lost instead of distributed to validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: FeeDistribution::amount] [Map size DoS] Can a malicious proposer create a FeeDistribution with millions of entries (one per possible u64 validator index) to cause memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: to_make_hot] [BTreeSet duplicates] Although BTreeSet prevents duplicates, can extremely large sets of unique StateKeys cause O(n log n) insertion overhead that slows down block processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Field: to_make_hot] [Malicious keys] Can to_make_hot BTreeSet include StateKeys for system accounts or genesis state that should never be cached, causing privilege escalation or unauthorized state access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone cost] Does Clone derive on BlockEpiloguePayload with large BTreeMap/BTreeSet cause expensive deep copies that can be exploited for DoS by forcing repeated cloning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Can crafted BlockEpiloguePayload instances that are semantically different but have equal serialized forms bypass equality checks in consensus verification? (High)",
