  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Epoch manipulation] Can an attacker submit a transcript with a future epoch number at line 75 that passes validation during epoch transition, allowing them to inject malicious DKG parameters for the next epoch and compromise the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Epoch race condition] Does the epoch check at line 75 have TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities where epoch_state.epoch can change between validation and aggregation, allowing stale transcripts to be aggregated into the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Epoch bypass] Can an attacker craft a DKGTranscript with metadata.epoch set to u64::MAX at line 75, causing integer overflow or wraparound that bypasses epoch validation and allows cross-epoch transcript injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch initialization] Does the TranscriptAggregationState initialization at lines 42-57 properly validate that epoch_state contains the correct epoch, or can an attacker initialize with mismatched epoch values causing validation bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Voting power bypass] At line 79, does get_voting_power() return None for removed validators, or can an attacker who was just removed from the validator set still submit transcripts before epoch transition completes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Authority spoofing] Can an attacker spoof the sender parameter at line 67 to impersonate another validator while using their own transcript_bytes, bypassing the author check at line 85 by exploiting network-layer authentication weaknesses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Voting power calculation] At lines 123-131, can an attacker manipulate the check_voting_power() calculation by submitting transcripts in a specific order that causes integer overflow in voting power accumulation, allowing threshold bypass with < 2/3 validator participation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Quorum manipulation] Does the quorum_voting_power() call at line 122 return a consistent threshold, or can Byzantine validators exploit epoch transition timing to cause different nodes to use different quorum thresholds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Validator removal race] If a validator is removed from the set between lines 79 and 126, can their transcript still be counted toward the quorum, allowing compromised validators to maintain influence after removal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Author mismatch] At line 85, can an attacker submit a transcript where metadata.author differs from sender, then exploit race conditions in contributor tracking at line 116 to have the same transcript counted twice under different identities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Identity confusion] Does the contributor HashSet at line 116 use metadata.author or sender for tracking, and can this inconsistency be exploited to bypass duplicate detection at line 92? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [AccountAddress collision] Can an attacker generate AccountAddress collisions in the contributors HashSet at line 19, allowing them to replace legitimate validator transcripts with malicious ones? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Deserialization DoS] At line 88, can an attacker send maliciously crafted transcript_bytes with deeply nested BCS structures that cause stack overflow or excessive memory allocation during deserialization, hanging the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Deserialization bypass] Does the bcs::from_bytes call at line 88 properly validate all type constraints, or can an attacker inject a transcript with type confusion that passes deserialization but fails cryptographic verification after being aggregated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Malformed transcript] Can an attacker craft transcript_bytes at line 88 that deserialize to a valid type but contain NaN, infinity, or other special floating-point values that corrupt the aggregated transcript at line 118? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Memory exhaustion] At line 88, is there a maximum size check for transcript_bytes, or can an attacker send gigabyte-sized transcripts that exhaust node memory before deserialization fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Duplicate bypass] At line 92, the duplicate check uses contributors.contains(&metadata.author), but can an attacker exploit Mutex unlock timing at line 91 to submit the same transcript twice concurrently before the insert at line 116? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Replay attack] Does returning Ok(None) at line 93 for duplicates prevent all replay scenarios, or can an attacker resubmit transcripts after epoch transitions to corrupt the next epoch's DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [HashSet collision] Can an attacker exploit potential hash collisions in the contributors HashSet at line 19 to bypass duplicate detection and submit multiple transcripts from the same validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Reorg vulnerability] If a blockchain reorg occurs, can transcripts in the contributors set at line 92 become stale but still prevent legitimate transcripts from being accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Verification bypass] At line 96, does verify_transcript_extra() with Some(sender) properly bind the sender identity to the transcript, or can an attacker submit a valid transcript from validator A claiming to be from validator B? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Verification order] Can an attacker exploit the order of verification (extra at line 96, then main at line 99) to pass verify_transcript_extra but fail verify_transcript after aggregation state is modified? (High)",
