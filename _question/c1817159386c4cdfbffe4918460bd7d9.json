  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: fee_statement_from_gas_meter()] [Gas manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the gas calculation by causing integer overflow in gas_used computation when max_gas_amount minus balance is computed, potentially leading to incorrect fee charging or free transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: charge_change_set()] [Storage fee bypass] Can an attacker craft transactions with specific write set patterns that cause process_storage_fee_for_all() to undercharge storage fees, allowing cheap state bloat attacks and potential DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: charge_change_set()] [Fee refund manipulation] If storage_deletion_refund feature is enabled, can an attacker exploit the refund calculation to get more refund than they paid, effectively stealing funds from the gas pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: gas_used()] [Integer underflow] Does the checked_sub() in gas_used properly handle all edge cases, or can carefully crafted transactions cause the balance to exceed max_gas_amount leading to panic or incorrect gas calculation?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: validate_signed_transaction()] [Account abstraction bypass] When account abstraction is enabled, can an attacker craft malformed AuthenticationProof that passes initial validation but fails during dispatchable_authenticate(), leaving the system in inconsistent state?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: run_prologue_with_payload()] [Sequence number manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the separation between prologue validation and execution to reorder transactions and bypass sequence number checks, enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: success_transaction_cleanup()] [Gas meter inconsistency] In gas_feature_version >= 12, if gas_meter.algebra().check_consistency() fails in success epilogue, the transaction is aborted, but can this be exploited to cause DoS by intentionally triggering inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/aptos_vm.rs] [Function: failed_transaction_cleanup()] [Error handling bypass] When gas meter consistency check fails in failure epilogue, the system logs but continues - can this lead to incorrect fee charging and economic exploits? (High)",
