  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious .mv file with invalid bytecode that causes CompiledModule::deserialize() to panic or trigger undefined behavior, potentially crashing the tool or enabling code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Integer Overflow] Does the check_module_complexity() call with u64::MAX parameter properly handle edge cases where expansion_size computation overflows, potentially returning incorrect complexity measurements that could be exploited in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Panic/DoS] The .unwrap() call on line 67 after check_module_complexity() can panic - can an attacker craft a module that intentionally triggers this panic by violating complexity constraints, causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted module with deeply nested or recursive structures that cause check_module_complexity() to consume unbounded memory during analysis, leading to OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Resource Leak] Does CompiledModule::deserialize() properly clean up resources on error paths, or can repeated deserialization failures with malformed modules cause memory leaks over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft bytecode that passes deserialize() checks but contains type inconsistencies that cause check_module_complexity() to produce incorrect results or crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Buffer Overflow] Does bytes.len() on line 70 safely handle extremely large module sizes (>usize::MAX on 32-bit systems), or could this cause integer truncation leading to incorrect size reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Clone Safety] The module.self_id().clone() operation on line 69 - can a malicious module have a crafted ModuleId that causes excessive memory allocation during cloning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker create a small .mv file that decompresses/expands to enormous size during deserialize(), consuming all available memory before check_module_complexity() is even called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info_single()] [Error Swallowing] The function returns Result but callers use .ok() which silently drops error information - can this hide critical deserialization failures that should halt processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info()] [Race Condition] The rayon parallel iterator processes modules concurrently - are there any shared mutable state or global variables that could be corrupted by concurrent access during deserialization?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info()] [Deadlock Risk] Does rayon::scope() properly handle panics in worker threads, or could a panic in extract_module_info_single() cause the scope to hang indefinitely waiting for results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info()] [Error Aggregation] Using flat_map with .ok() silently discards all failures - could this hide systematic deserialization issues where many modules fail, giving false confidence in results?

  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: extract_module_info()] [Panic Safety] If extract_module_info_single() panics in one thread, does rayon properly propagate the panic, or could it silently continue processing and return partial results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: list_files_with_extension()] [Path Traversal] The function recursively walks directories without validating paths - can an attacker use symlinks pointing outside the target directory to trick the tool into reading sensitive system files?
