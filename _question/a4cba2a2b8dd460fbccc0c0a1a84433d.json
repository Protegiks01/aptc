  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Transaction ordering] Can the indexer process transactions out of order if the DbReader returns non-sequential data, potentially corrupting indexed state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Reorg handling] If the blockchain undergoes a reorg, does the indexer properly handle this through the DbReader interface, or can stale data remain indexed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Data race on shared config] If multiple components modify NodeConfig concurrently, can the indexer read partially updated config values causing inconsistent initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Initialization DoS] Can an attacker trigger repeated indexer initialization failures by providing malicious NodeConfig values, causing the node to waste resources on failed bootstrap attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Runtime spawn bomb] Can malicious code exploit the runtime creation to spawn excessive threads or tasks, exhausting system resources and causing node unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Resource starvation] Can the indexer runtime starve other critical node components (consensus, execution) of CPU or memory resources, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Chain ID validation] Is the ChainId parameter cryptographically validated against the genesis block, or can an attacker spoof chain IDs to make the indexer process wrong chain data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Trust boundary violation] Does this function act as a trust boundary between untrusted config inputs and trusted blockchain data, or can untrusted inputs directly corrupt blockchain processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Services coordination failure] If the calling code in services.rs doesn't properly coordinate indexer bootstrap with other service initialization, can this cause deadlocks or initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Multiple runtime conflict] Can the indexer Runtime conflict with other Runtimes created for API, consensus, or mempool, causing task scheduling issues or deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Mempool client sharing] Is the MempoolClientSender properly cloneable and thread-safe for concurrent use by indexer and other components, or can shared access cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Version incompatibility] If nodes running different versions of this code interoperate, can differences in indexer initialization cause network inconsistencies or consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Config migration] When NodeConfig format changes across versions, does this function handle legacy config formats gracefully, or can old configs cause crashes or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Feature flag evolution] If the 'indexer' feature flag is removed or replaced in future versions, can nodes with different build configurations interoperate safely? (Low)"
