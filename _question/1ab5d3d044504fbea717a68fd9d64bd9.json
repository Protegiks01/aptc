  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Nested Pool Corruption] Since 'distribution_pool' is embedded, can attackers exploit the nested DistributionPool vulnerabilities through StakingContract deserialization to bypass outer validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Commission-Principal Mismatch] Can 'commission_percentage' be set to a high value while 'principal' is near u64::MAX, causing commission calculation overflows during reward distribution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Zero Principal Attack] Can 'principal' be deserialized as zero while keeping other fields valid, causing division-by-zero or incorrect reward ratio calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Address Collision] Can 'owner_cap', 'signer_cap', and 'pool_address' all be set to the same address, creating ambiguous ownership and enabling unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractEntry] [Key-Value Mismatch] Does deserialization validate that the 'key' AccountAddress matches any address within the nested 'value' StakingContract (e.g., pool_address or owner_cap), or can mismatched entries cause routing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractEntry] [Duplicate Keys] Since entries will be stored in a vector, can multiple entries share the same 'key', allowing attackers to create conflicting staking contract definitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractEntry] [System Address Key] Can 'key' be deserialized as a system address (0x0, 0x1), potentially interfering with protocol-level staking operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Vector Size DoS] Can 'staking_contracts' vector be deserialized with billions of entries, causing memory exhaustion when loading the store and crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Duplicate Contract Keys] Does deserialization enforce uniqueness of 'key' fields across all StakingContractEntry items in the vector, or can duplicate keys cause state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Event Handle Corruption] Can event handle fields (create_staking_contract_events, update_voter_events, etc.) be deserialized with invalid counter/guid values, breaking event emission and monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Event Handle Collision] Can multiple event handle fields share the same GUID during deserialization, causing different event types to be mixed and breaking event indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Empty Store State] Can the 'staking_contracts' vector be deserialized as empty while event handles have non-zero counters, indicating events were emitted for non-existent contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Nested Overflow Amplification] Since each StakingContractEntry contains a full StakingContract with embedded DistributionPool, can nested integer overflow vulnerabilities compound across multiple contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContractStore] [Contract Limit Bypass] Is there a maximum number of contracts enforced during deserialization, or can unlimited contracts be added to evade per-contract limits through sharding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Cross-Struct Validation] [State Consistency] Does deserialization validate that all pool_addresses in StakingContract entries are unique across the staking_contracts vector, preventing double-staking to the same pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Cross-Struct Validation] [Referential Integrity] Can owner_cap addresses in one StakingContract match pool_addresses in another contract, creating circular ownership dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Cross-Struct Validation] [Total Value Overflow] Can the sum of all 'principal' amounts across all StakingContract entries overflow u64, while individual values are valid, hiding the total stake amount? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Cross-Struct Validation] [Shareholder Overlap] Can the same AccountAddress appear as a shareholder in distribution_pools across multiple contracts, potentially allowing double-counting of voting power? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Serde Framework] [Deserialization Bomb] Can deeply nested or recursive structures in the serde deserialization cause stack overflow when parsing malicious StakingContractStore payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Serde Framework] [Type Confusion] Does serde deserialization properly validate that u64 fields don't contain negative values encoded in two's complement, or can type confusion lead to unexpected values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Serde Framework] [Extra Fields Injection] If using serde's deny_unknown_fields, can attackers inject extra fields during deserialization to bypass validation or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Serde Framework] [Missing Field Defaults] Do all struct fields have explicit defaults, or can missing fields during partial deserialization result in uninitialized or zero values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Economic Attack] [Reward Manipulation] Can an attacker deserialize a StakingContract with principal=1, commission_percentage=99%, and distribution_pool.total_coins=u64::MAX to instantly claim maximum rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Economic Attack] [Share Dilution] By setting distribution_pool.total_shares to u64::MAX and total_coins to 1, can attackers make existing shares worthless and extract all rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Economic Attack] [Commission Front-Running] Can commission_percentage be modified during deserialization right before reward distribution to maximize operator extraction? (High)"
