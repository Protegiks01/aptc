  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type confusion] Can type mismatches or invalid cast operations occur between UnitTestingConfig, TestPlan, and UnitTestFactory that could lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior during test execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Option handling] When build_test_plan() returns Some(test_plan), is the test_plan properly validated before being passed to run_and_report_unit_tests, or can a maliciously constructed test plan exploit validation gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path disclosure] Can error messages or output from the test runner inadvertently disclose sensitive filesystem paths, environment variables, or system information that could aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Source code leakage] Does test execution or reporting reveal source code, bytecode, or implementation details of private Move modules that should remain confidential? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [VM escape] During test execution via run_and_report_unit_tests, can malicious Move bytecode exploit vulnerabilities in the Move VM to break sandbox isolation and access host system resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode injection] Can an attacker modify compiled Move bytecode between test plan construction and execution to inject malicious opcodes that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Empty test plan] When build_test_plan() returns None on line 12, does the program handle this edge case securely without leaving resources in inconsistent states or creating vulnerabilities for subsequent executions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Exit code manipulation] Does the test runner properly set exit codes based on test results, or can malicious tests manipulate exit codes to falsely report success when security violations occurred? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal handling] Are SIGINT, SIGTERM, and other signals properly handled during test execution to ensure clean shutdown and prevent resource leaks or corrupted state? (Low)"
