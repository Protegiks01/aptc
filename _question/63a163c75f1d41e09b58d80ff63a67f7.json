  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Version compatibility] Are serialized filters forward/backward compatible across protocol upgrades, or can version mismatches cause filters to malfunction after upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Struct: BatchTransactionFilter] [Schema evolution] Can changes to the BatchTransactionFilter schema in future versions cause deserialization failures or security bypasses when processing old-format filters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Enum: BatchMatcher] [Variant addition] If new BatchMatcher variants are added in protocol upgrades, will old validators fail safely or incorrectly process new matcher types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: filter_batch_transactions()] [Batch integrity] Does filter_batch_transactions() validate that the filtered transaction set maintains batch integrity properties, or can filtering violate batch invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Transaction immutability] Does allows_transaction() modify the signed_transaction parameter in any way, potentially causing consensus divergence through transaction mutation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: filter_batch_transactions()] [Digest consistency] After filtering transactions, is the batch_digest still valid for the filtered transaction set, or can digest mismatches cause validation failures? (High)"
