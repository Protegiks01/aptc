  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: ping_peer(), line 416-428] [Response Processing Delay] Ping responses are collected asynchronously in tick_handlers - can delayed processing of old responses cause incorrect failure attribution when peer connectivity changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 285-295] [Serialization Failure] When protocol.to_bytes() fails for Pong messages (line 285-295), the response is silently dropped - can this be exploited to make honest nodes appear unresponsive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Struct: HealthCheckerMsg, line 83-86] [Message Type Confusion] The enum has only Ping and Pong variants - can deserializing malformed messages cause panics or undefined behavior before reaching the match statement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Struct: Ping, line 89] [Type Safety] Ping wraps a u32 - can integer overflow in the nonce value when deserializing cause unexpected behavior or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: ping_peer(), line 424-427] [Invalid Response Type] The code checks for HealthCheckerMsg::Pong but returns InvalidRpcResponse for other types - can a malicious peer send crafted responses that pass deserialization but aren't Pong messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 304] [State Inconsistency] reset_peer_failures() is called on incoming Ping - can this be exploited by a malicious peer to reset their own failure counter by sending Ping messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 329-330] [Missing State Check] reset_peer_round_state() is called without checking if the peer still exists - can race conditions with LostPeer events cause state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 361-364] [Unwrap or Default] get_peer_failures() returns Option and uses unwrap_or(0) - can this hide state corruption where peer data is unexpectedly missing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 232] [Global State Access] connected_peers() is called on network_interface - can concurrent modifications to the peer set cause stale peer lists or iterator invalidation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: new(), line 120-139] [Unchecked Parameters] Constructor accepts ping_interval, ping_timeout, and ping_failures_tolerated without validation - can zero or extreme values cause division by zero, infinite loops, or immediate disconnects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: new(), line 136] [Initial Round] Round counter starts at 0 - can this cause issues with peer initialization if peers expect rounds to start at 1 or higher? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: health_checker_network_config(), line 76] [LIFO Queue] The network service uses QueueStyle::LIFO for events - can this cause health check messages to be processed out of order during high load, leading to incorrect failure detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: health_checker_network_config(), line 67] [Empty Direct Send] direct_send_protocols is empty but checked in the config - can misconfigurations allow direct send messages to bypass protocol validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 165-166] [Connection Event Stream] connection_events stream is created from subscription - can channel closure or overflow cause missed connection events and stale peer state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 306] [Oneshot Send Failure] res_tx.send() result is ignored with let _ - can failed sends cause the RPC caller to hang indefinitely waiting for response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: health_checker_network_config(), line 75-77] [Channel Capacity] NETWORK_CHANNEL_SIZE is used for the channel - can this fixed capacity cause backpressure or message drops during network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 152] [FuturesUnordered] tick_handlers uses FuturesUnordered which has no size limit - can unbounded growth during slow network conditions lead to memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: new(), line 132] [RNG Seeding] SmallRng::from_entropy() is used for RNG initialization - is the entropy source sufficient to prevent nonce prediction attacks in adversarial network conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 245] [Nonce Space] u32 nonces provide only 2^32 unique values - can birthday paradox collisions in high-frequency health checks lead to nonce reuse vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Struct: HealthCheckerMsg, line 83-86] [No Authentication] Ping/Pong messages contain only nonces with no cryptographic authentication - can an attacker perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and replay messages?
