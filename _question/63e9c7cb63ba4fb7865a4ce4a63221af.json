  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: new()] [Input validation] Can an attacker pass an unbounded or maliciously crafted asset_uri string (e.g., 10MB+ or containing SQL injection payloads) that causes memory exhaustion or database corruption when the struct is instantiated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: new()] [SQL injection] Does the asset_uri parameter undergo any sanitization before being used as a primary key in the database, or can SQL metacharacters in the URI lead to injection attacks through Diesel ORM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_asset_uri()] [Primary key manipulation] Can an attacker call set_asset_uri() to change the primary key of an existing database record, potentially causing orphaned records, constraint violations, or allowing URI collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_raw_image_uri()] [URI injection] Can malicious image URIs containing newlines, null bytes, or script tags be stored without validation, leading to SSRF, XSS, or log injection vulnerabilities when these URIs are later fetched or displayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_raw_animation_uri()] [URI scheme bypass] Can an attacker inject URIs with dangerous schemes (file://, javascript:, data:) that bypass content fetching security controls when the crawler attempts to process animation resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_cdn_json_uri()] [CDN substitution] Can an attacker manipulate the cdn_json_uri to point to a malicious CDN endpoint, causing the crawler to fetch and cache poisoned metadata that propagates incorrect NFT information across the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_cdn_image_uri()] [CDN hijacking] If cdn_image_uri is set to an attacker-controlled endpoint, can this be exploited to serve malicious images containing steganographic payloads or trigger crawler vulnerabilities when the image is processed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_cdn_animation_uri()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker set cdn_animation_uri to point to an extremely large animation file (multi-GB) causing the crawler to consume excessive bandwidth and storage when attempting to cache the resource? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: increment_json_parser_retry_count()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker trigger json_parser_retry_count to overflow by causing repeated parsing failures, potentially wrapping to negative values or zero and bypassing retry limit checks that expect positive values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: increment_image_optimizer_retry_count()] [Integer overflow] Does image_optimizer_retry_count have bounds checking, or can it be incremented beyond i32::MAX causing integer overflow and potentially resetting the counter or causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: increment_animation_optimizer_retry_count()] [Integer overflow] Can animation_optimizer_retry_count be overflowed through repeated failed processing attempts, allowing an attacker to bypass retry limits and cause infinite reprocessing loops consuming system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: increment_json_parser_retry_count()] [Race condition] If multiple threads/tasks call increment_json_parser_retry_count() concurrently on the same ParsedAssetUris instance, can race conditions lead to lost increments or incorrect final counts bypassing max retry thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: reset_json_parser_retry_count()] [Logic bug] Can reset_json_parser_retry_count() be called at inappropriate times (e.g., during active retry processing) causing the retry count to be zeroed while the system still needs to track failures, leading to infinite retry loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Struct: ParsedAssetUris] [Missing bounds] Are there any maximum value constraints on json_parser_retry_count, image_optimizer_retry_count, and animation_optimizer_retry_count, or can these counters grow indefinitely causing database storage issues or i32 overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_last_transaction_version()] [Version rollback] Can an attacker set last_transaction_version to an older version number, causing the crawler to re-process already-handled transactions and potentially overwriting newer metadata with stale data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_last_transaction_version()] [Version overflow] Can last_transaction_version overflow i64::MAX with future high transaction volumes, and is there handling for wraparound that could cause version comparison logic to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_last_transaction_version()] [Negative versions] Can last_transaction_version be set to negative values, potentially causing comparison bugs when checking if a new transaction is newer than the last processed version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_last_transaction_version()] [Uninitialized state] Does get_last_transaction_version() returning 0 for new records create ambiguity with genesis transaction (version 0), potentially causing the crawler to skip processing legitimate transaction 0 events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_do_not_parse()] [Access control bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the do_not_parse flag externally to prevent legitimate NFT metadata from being crawled, effectively censoring specific assets from the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_do_not_parse()] [Logic inversion] If do_not_parse is true, are all parsing, optimization, and CDN operations properly skipped, or can race conditions allow partial processing to occur before the flag is checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: set_do_not_parse()] [Permanent blacklist] Once do_not_parse is set to true, is there any mechanism to re-enable parsing, or can this create permanent blacklisting of assets that should be recovered? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_asset_uri()] [Memory exhaustion] Does get_asset_uri() clone the potentially large asset_uri string on every call, and can this be exploited in high-frequency access patterns to cause excessive memory allocation and OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_raw_image_uri()] [Excessive cloning] Can repeated calls to get_raw_image_uri() in tight loops cause memory pressure by cloning Option<String> repeatedly, especially for assets with very long URIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_raw_animation_uri()] [Clone overhead] Does the unnecessary clone in get_raw_animation_uri() create performance bottlenecks when processing large batches of NFT metadata, potentially slowing down the entire crawler? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/parsed_asset_uris.rs] [Function: get_cdn_json_uri()] [String allocation] Are the String clones in all getter methods (get_cdn_json_uri, get_cdn_image_uri, etc.) necessary, or could references be returned to avoid heap allocations in hot paths? (Low)"
