  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge Case: Zero Stake] Can validators with voting_powers[i]=0 be elected as leaders despite having 0 stake, breaking economic security? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge Case: Maximum Window] If window_size is set to maximum possible value (usize::MAX), can any calculations overflow or database queries fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge Case: Round 0] The special handling for target_round==0 - can attackers exploit this to bypass certain validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge Case: Epoch 0] Are there special considerations for epoch 0 that could be exploited during network genesis? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Boundary: u32 Overflow] All vote and proposal counts use u32 - can a validator participate in >4 billion blocks causing counter overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Boundary: u64 Round] Rounds are u64 - can round overflow after 2^64 rounds, affecting saturating_sub(exclude_round)? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Boundary: u128 Stake] Stake weights use u128 - is there any path where stake * weight overflows u128? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Invalid Window Sizes] Can voter_window_size or proposer_window_size be set to 0, causing division by zero or empty windows? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Invalid Weights] Can active_weight, inactive_weight, or failed_weight be set to 0, causing all validators to have 0 total weight and breaking leader selection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Invalid Threshold] Can failure_threshold_percent be set to >100, causing the threshold comparison to never trigger and allowing failed validators to keep high weight? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Exclude Round] Can exclude_round be set to extremely high value causing target_round to always be 0, breaking recency in reputation calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Window Health Mismatch] If window_for_chain_health is not in CHAIN_HEALTH_WINDOW_SIZES, the panic occurs - can misconfigurations cause consensus halt? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Seek Length] Can seek_len be set too small, causing frequent cache misses and performance degradation, or too large causing memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Config: Root Hash Toggle] The use_root_hash flag changes leader election seed - can this be toggled mid-epoch to manipulate leader selection? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Crypto: Hash Collision] If root_hash from get_accumulator_root_hash() collides (birthday attack), can different blocks lead to same leader selection seed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Crypto: Deterministic RNG] The state bytes concat for choose_index() - is the RNG truly deterministic across different platforms and Rust versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Crypto: Weak Hash] Is HashValue using cryptographically secure hash, or can it be manipulated by validators crafting blocks with specific transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Crypto: Seed Grinding] Can validators grind on round numbers or transactions to influence root_hash and bias leader selection in their favor? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Metrics: Race Conditions] Global metric updates (COMMITTED_PROPOSALS_IN_WINDOW.set(), etc.) - can race conditions between validators cause inconsistent monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Metrics: Integer Cast] Metrics use i64 but counts are u32 - can casting cause sign issues or overflow in extreme cases? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Metrics: Misleading Values] If error paths return early with default values (0, empty vecs), can metrics misrepresent actual network health? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Struct: VersionedNewBlockEvent] Does the version field properly validate against transaction_version to prevent manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Struct: BitVec Capacity] The BitVec for votes - can its capacity be manipulated to represent more or fewer validators than actually exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Struct: Author Uniqueness] Are Author addresses guaranteed to be unique, or can collisions allow vote/proposal attribution to wrong validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Struct: EpochState Immutability] Can epoch_to_proposers HashMap be modified during reputation calculation causing race conditions? (High)"
