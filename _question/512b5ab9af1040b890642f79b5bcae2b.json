  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [Overlapping ranges] Can an attacker exploit overlapping IP ranges in the configuration file to cause undefined behavior in contains_ip(), potentially allowing or denying bypass inconsistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [Comment parsing] Does IpRangeManager correctly skip comment lines (starting with # or //) in the config file, or could specially crafted comments be interpreted as IP ranges? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [Empty file] What happens if config.file is empty or contains only comments - does IpRangeManager create an empty allowlist that blocks all bypass attempts, or does it fail initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [File encoding] Does IpRangeManager handle different file encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, Latin-1) correctly, or could encoding issues cause valid IP ranges to be ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [Whitespace handling] Are leading/trailing whitespace characters properly trimmed from IP range lines, or could ' 192.168.1.0/24 ' fail to match '192.168.1.0/24' in contains_ip()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Dependency: IpRangeManager] [Case sensitivity] Does IP range parsing handle case-insensitive hex digits in IPv6 addresses (e.g., 2001:0DB8:: vs 2001:0db8::) correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Config: IpRangeManagerConfig] [File permissions] Does the faucet service validate that config.file has appropriate read permissions and ownership to prevent unauthorized modification of the allowlist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Config: IpRangeManagerConfig] [File watching] Is there a file watcher that detects changes to config.file at runtime, and could this be exploited to inject malicious IP ranges without service restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Config: IpRangeManagerConfig] [Relative paths] If config.file uses a relative path, is it resolved relative to a predictable location, or could working directory manipulation change which file is loaded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Config: IpRangeManagerConfig] [Deserialization] Since IpRangeManagerConfig derives Deserialize, can malicious YAML/JSON input exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary file paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Economic attack] [Faucet draining] If an attacker compromises a machine on an allowlisted IP range, can they programmatically drain the faucet by making unlimited funding requests without any rate limiting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Economic attack] [Sybil attack] Can an attacker create multiple accounts from an allowlisted IP and fund them all without limits, enabling Sybil attacks on applications that rely on the faucet for user onboarding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Economic attack] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker from an allowlisted IP flood the faucet with concurrent requests to exhaust the transaction submission capacity of the funder backend? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Economic attack] [Front-running] Can attackers on allowlisted IPs observe pending transactions and front-run them to steal value, since they have unrestricted access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [Proxy abuse] Can an attacker use an open proxy or VPN exit node located in an allowlisted IP range to gain bypass privileges without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [NAT traversal] In a NAT environment, can multiple users behind the same allowlisted public IP all gain bypass privileges, creating an unintended privilege escalation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [IPv6 privacy extensions] Do temporary IPv6 addresses from privacy extensions still match allowlisted /64 ranges, or can address rotation bypass the allowlist? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [Cloudflare bypass] If the faucet is behind Cloudflare or similar CDN, does it trust the CF-Connecting-IP header, and can this header be spoofed to match allowlisted IPs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [X-Forwarded-For injection] Does the source_ip extraction properly validate X-Forwarded-For headers, or can an attacker inject allowlisted IPs into the header chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [Loopback bypass] Are loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1) ever in the allowlist, and could this allow local exploits to bypass all security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Network attack] [Private range abuse] Are RFC 1918 private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) included in the allowlist, potentially allowing internal network access to bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Type safety] [CheckerData cloning] Does the Clone trait on CheckerData create deep or shallow copies, and could shared references to source_ip lead to data races in concurrent access? (Low)",
