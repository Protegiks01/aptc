  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Module exports] [Namespace collision] Can the wildcard re-exports (pub use *) on lines 66-124 cause namespace collisions where multiple event types share identical struct or function names, allowing an attacker to confuse event parsing logic and trigger incorrect state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Module exports] [Type confusion] Can malicious code exploit the fact that all event modules are publicly re-exported without scoping to substitute one event type for another during deserialization, potentially causing CoinDeposit events to be interpreted as CoinWithdraw events leading to incorrect balance updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_governance_create_proposal_event()] [String comparison bypass] Can an attacker craft governance proposal events with Unicode normalization differences, zero-width characters, or mixed case to bypass the string equality checks on lines 127-128, allowing unauthorized proposal creation events that evade governance controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_governance_create_proposal_event()] [Event type injection] Does the function properly validate the event_type string length and encoding, or can an attacker inject malformed UTF-8 sequences or excessively long strings to cause parsing errors, DoS, or buffer overflows in downstream event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinDeposit export] [Amount overflow] In the CoinDeposit event structure exported from coin_deposit.rs, can an attacker emit events with u64::MAX amounts that cause integer overflow when aggregated with existing balances, leading to incorrect total supply calculations or balance wrapping? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinDeposit export] [Deserialization attack] Can malicious BCS-encoded CoinDeposit events include invalid coin_type strings with embedded null bytes, control characters, or non-UTF8 sequences via try_from_bytes() that corrupt the coin type registry or cause crashes in indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinDeposit export] [Account spoofing] Can an attacker craft CoinDeposit events with account addresses that don't match the actual transaction sender, creating false deposit records that manipulate balance queries or audit logs without actual funds transfer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinWithdraw export] [Double withdrawal] Can an attacker emit multiple CoinWithdraw events with the same transaction but different amounts, exploiting race conditions in event processing to withdraw more funds than their actual balance, leading to negative balance states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinWithdraw export] [Amount underflow] Can CoinWithdraw events be crafted with amounts exceeding the account's actual balance when processed out of order, causing integer underflows in balance calculations that wrap around to large positive values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mint export] [Unlimited minting] In the Mint event from mint.rs, can an attacker exploit the AggregatorSnapshotResource index field to bypass mint caps or maximum supply limits by providing manipulated aggregator snapshots that don't reflect true minting state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mint export] [Collection address forgery] Can malicious Mint events specify arbitrary collection addresses not owned by the minter, allowing unauthorized token creation that appears to belong to legitimate collections and deceives users or marketplaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mint export] [Token address collision] Can Mint events with predictable token addresses be front-run by attackers who pre-create resources at those addresses, causing mint operations to fail or tokens to be minted to attacker-controlled addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Burn export] [Burn replay] Can Burn events from burn.rs be replayed across different epochs or transactions to falsely indicate multiple burns of the same token, corrupting supply tracking and allowing economic exploits in deflation-based tokenomics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Burn export] [Previous owner manipulation] Can attackers emit Burn events with falsified previous_owner addresses to create misleading burn history, enabling tax evasion, money laundering trails, or fraudulent NFT provenance claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Burn export] [Index manipulation] Can the burn index field be manipulated to point to non-existent tokens or tokens in different collections, causing state inconsistencies where burned tokens still appear as active or active tokens appear burned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Transfer export] [Circular transfer] In Transfer events from transfer.rs, can an attacker create circular transfer chains (A→B→A) with identical timestamps that confuse ownership tracking, enabling double-spending or theft by claiming ownership from multiple points in the cycle? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Transfer export] [Self-transfer exploit] Can Transfer events with identical from and to addresses bypass transfer fees, tax mechanisms, or transfer hooks by exploiting code paths that assume sender and receiver are always different? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Transfer export] [Object address validation] Are Transfer events validated to ensure the object address actually exists and is owned by the from address, or can attackers emit fake transfer events for non-existent objects to manipulate ownership records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [KeyRotation export] [Key rollback attack] In KeyRotation events from key_rotation.rs, can an attacker replay old KeyRotation events to rollback an account's authentication key to a compromised historical key, regaining access to accounts after the legitimate owner rotated to a secure key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [KeyRotation export] [Authentication key validation] Do KeyRotation events validate that the old_authentication_key actually matches the current key before rotation, or can attackers force key rotations from arbitrary old keys, potentially locking out legitimate owners? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [KeyRotation export] [Key length attack] Can KeyRotation events include authentication keys of invalid lengths (empty, too short, too long) that corrupt the authentication system or enable bypasses where no key is required for signing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [KeyRotation export] [Key collision] Can attackers rotate to authentication keys that collide with other accounts' keys (using hash collisions or weak key derivation), enabling cross-account impersonation and unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [NewBlockEvent export] [Block hash manipulation] In NewBlockEvent from new_block.rs, can Byzantine validators emit events with manipulated hash fields that don't match the actual block hash, causing indexers and light clients to accept invalid blocks as canonical? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [NewBlockEvent export] [Epoch confusion] Can NewBlockEvent epochs be manipulated to skip epochs or repeat epoch numbers, confusing validator set transitions and enabling double-signing or safety rule bypasses across epoch boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [NewBlockEvent export] [Round manipulation] Can malicious proposers emit NewBlockEvent with out-of-sequence round numbers that violate AptosBFT ordering, enabling consensus safety violations or forks in the chain? (Critical)"
