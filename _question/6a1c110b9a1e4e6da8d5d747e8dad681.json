  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: GlobalDataSummary] [State consistency] Can a malicious peer provide inconsistent GlobalDataSummary data where advertised_data claims certain ranges exist but optimal_chunk_sizes are set to 0, causing synchronization to fail or request invalid chunk sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: empty()] [Initialization vulnerability] Does using GlobalDataSummary::empty() during startup create a vulnerability window where nodes accept invalid synchronization requests before proper data is advertised, potentially allowing Byzantine peers to serve incorrect state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Logic error] Can the is_empty() check be bypassed if PartialEq implementation for nested structs has bugs, allowing partially initialized GlobalDataSummary to pass as empty and skip validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Memory safety] Does the Clone implementation for GlobalDataSummary properly deep-clone all nested Vec structures including synced_ledger_infos, or can shared references lead to data races when multiple threads modify the cloned data?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: OptimalChunkSizes] [DoS via zero chunks] Can Byzantine nodes advertise optimal chunk sizes of 0 for all fields, causing synchronizing nodes to make infinite requests with zero-sized chunks, resulting in request storms and network degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: OptimalChunkSizes::empty()] [Default state vulnerability] Does initializing with empty() (all zeros) cause requesting logic to fail or make invalid assumptions, potentially halting state synchronization when no peers have provided chunk size recommendations?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: OptimalChunkSizes] [Integer overflow] When aggregating optimal_chunk_sizes from multiple peers, can arithmetic operations on epoch_chunk_size, state_chunk_size, transaction_chunk_size, or transaction_output_chunk_size overflow, wrapping to small values and causing inefficient or broken synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: OptimalChunkSizes] [Inconsistent recommendations] Can attackers exploit the lack of validation between different chunk size fields (e.g., transaction_chunk_size >> transaction_output_chunk_size) to create resource allocation imbalances or trigger edge cases in chunk processing logic?
