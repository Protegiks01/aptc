  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Maximum string length] Is there a maximum string length enforced, or can extremely long strings cause integer overflows in size calculations or exhaust memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [Const correctness] The deref returns &str through a *const Entry pointer - can this be cast to *mut Entry elsewhere to violate const correctness and mutate immutable data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Memory layout] Does the #[repr(C)] or other repr attributes guarantee stable memory layout for Symbol, or can compiler optimizations change the layout and break pointer assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Panic safety] If any operation during Symbol creation panics, does this leave the pool in a consistent state, or can partial insertions corrupt the pool's internal linked lists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Global: SYMBOL_POOL] [Static initialization order] Is SYMBOL_POOL guaranteed to be initialized before any Symbol is created, or can static initialization order issues cause access to uninitialized memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [Pointer provenance] Does the pointer-to-integer-to-pointer conversion preserve LLVM pointer provenance metadata, or can provenance loss enable pointer confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Zero-cost abstraction] Does the zero-cost abstraction guarantee hold, or can compiler optimizations introduce unexpected overhead or behavior changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Allocation failure] What happens if heap allocation fails during Box::new() for Entry - does this panic and crash the validator, or is it handled gracefully? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [TOCTOU race] Can there be a time-of-check to time-of-use race between validating a Symbol pointer and dereferencing it, allowing invalid memory access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Global: SYMBOL_POOL] [Fork safety] If a validator process forks, does the child process inherit a valid SYMBOL_POOL state, or can forking cause corruption or deadlocks in the mutex? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Optimization barriers] Can compiler optimizations like constant propagation or dead code elimination incorrectly optimize away Symbol validity checks, introducing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Hash collision DoS] Can an attacker craft strings that all hash to the same bucket, creating O(n^2) insertion time and causing denial of service during transaction processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [Speculative execution] Can speculative execution on modern CPUs cause unsafe pointer dereferences to be speculatively executed before bounds checks, enabling Spectre-style attacks? (Low)"
