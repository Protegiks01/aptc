  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Metrics exposure] [Privacy violation] If VM_TIMER metrics are publicly accessible via Prometheus endpoints, can attackers correlate timing patterns with specific account activities to deanonymize users or predict upcoming governance proposals based on execution time spikes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Timer labels] [Data leakage] If timer label names include transaction-specific data like account addresses or module names, can an attacker scrape Prometheus metrics to reconstruct private contract interactions or identify validator transaction processing patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Static: VM_TIMER] [Data race] Are concurrent calls to VM_TIMER.timer_with_label() from parallel transaction execution threads properly synchronized, or can data races in the underlying Prometheus histogram cause corrupted metric observations or crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Static: VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE] [Race condition] When multiple threads update VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE concurrently during module loading, can race conditions cause the gauge value to become inconsistent with actual cache size, breaking cache management and memory limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [HistogramTimer] [Timer leak] If a HistogramTimer is created but not properly dropped due to panic in VM execution, does it leak resources or record incorrect timing data, potentially accumulating over time and causing memory exhaustion or metrics corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Bucket calculation] [Floating point precision] The bucket calculation uses f64 (next *= factor) - can cumulative floating-point errors over 32 iterations cause bucket boundaries to drift from expected values, breaking SLA monitoring or alerting thresholds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Bucket generation] [Numerical instability] Starting from 1e-9 and multiplying by 2.0 for 32 iterations reaches ~4.3 seconds - can edge cases in floating-point arithmetic cause the final bucket to be NaN or Inf, causing panic when Prometheus validates bucket ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [HistogramTimer] [Time measurement precision] Does the Prometheus HistogramTimer use monotonic clocks or wall-clock time, and can attackers exploit clock skew or NTP manipulation to inject false timing metrics that misrepresent VM performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [VM_TIMER] [Metrics poisoning] Can an attacker craft transactions that selectively trigger expensive VM operations only on target validators, causing their VM_TIMER metrics to show degraded performance and triggering false slashing alerts or reputation damage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE] [Cache poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate the verified module cache to cause VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE to report incorrect values, breaking automated cache eviction policies and causing either memory exhaustion or unnecessary cache misses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Metric integrity] [Tampering] If metrics are used for validator performance scoring or slashing decisions, can an attacker tamper with VM_TIMER or VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE values to frame honest validators as underperforming or manipulate reputation systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [VM_TIMER] [Alert fatigue] Can an attacker trigger edge cases that cause VM_TIMER values to fall outside expected ranges, creating false positive alerts that cause monitoring fatigue and mask real performance degradation or attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Metrics aggregation] [Skewed statistics] If VM_TIMER records times for both successful and failed transactions, can an attacker flood the network with intentionally failing transactions to skew average execution time metrics and hide performance anomalies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE] [Capacity planning] If cache size metrics are used for validator capacity planning, can an attacker manipulate cache behavior to cause VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE to report misleading values, leading operators to over-provision or under-provision validator resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Dependency: once_cell] [Lazy initialization safety] Does the once_cell::sync::Lazy guarantee safe initialization in the presence of panics, or can a panic during VM_TIMER initialization leave the static in a poisoned state that causes all future VM operations to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Dependency: prometheus] [Crate vulnerability] Are there known vulnerabilities in the prometheus crate version used, such as buffer overflows in metric name parsing or histogram updates, that could allow remote code execution through crafted metric labels? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Global state] [State pollution] Since VM_TIMER and VERIFIED_MODULE_CACHE_SIZE are global statics, can metrics from test code or development environments pollute production metrics in validators that share the same process space, causing incorrect monitoring data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: Timer trait] [Usage guidance] The documentation warns against hot path usage but doesn't specify which paths are hot - can developers inadvertently place timers in consensus-critical code paths, introducing overhead that breaks sub-second finality guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Metric naming] [Collision risk] The metric names 'vm_timer_seconds' and 'verified_module_cache_size' are hardcoded - can naming collisions with metrics from other Aptos components cause registration failures or metric confusion that breaks observability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/metrics/src/lib.rs] [Timer usage] [Resource leak] If callers create timers via timer_with_label() but forget to drop them (e.g., by moving them into long-lived data structures), can accumulated undropped timers cause memory leaks or prevent metrics from being recorded correctly? (Low)"
