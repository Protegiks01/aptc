  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms()] [Extend Operation] At line 58, does the extend operation efficiently append terms, or can large term lists cause quadratic reallocation behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms()] [Push Performance] Can repeated push operations in the nested loop at line 43-50 cause performance degradation when result vectors reach thousands of elements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [String Comparison] At line 95, does the BTreeMap key comparison for String names handle unicode normalization correctly, or can equivalent names with different representations cause duplicate entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Name Collision] Can attackers craft GasParam names that are lexicographically adjacent in the BTreeMap to exploit any ordering-dependent logic in downstream code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms + aggregate_terms] [Pipeline Attack] Can an attacker craft an expression that passes expand_terms with exponential blowup but then triggers integer overflow in aggregate_terms, bypassing both memory and gas limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms + aggregate_terms] [Combined Exploit] Can deep recursion in expand_terms followed by large coefficient accumulation in aggregate_terms create a combined attack that exhausts both stack and heap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms + aggregate_terms] [Multi-stage Attack] Can attackers use expand_terms to generate millions of terms, then rely on the BTreeMap in aggregate_terms to cause O(n log n) insertion time, creating cumulative slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Coefficient Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a gas expression where the same GasParam appears multiple times with carefully chosen coefficients that sum to 1 instead of the correct higher value, undercharging gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Zero-Sum Attack] Can attackers create expressions where positive and negative coefficients cancel out (if overflow wraps to appear negative), resulting in zero gas cost for expensive operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms()] [Distributive Property] Can incorrect application of distributive property during term expansion lead to gas calculation errors where (a+b)*c is not equivalent to a*c + b*c? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: expand_terms()] [Concurrency] If expand_terms is called concurrently on shared DynamicExpression data, can race conditions in the recursive calls cause non-deterministic results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/algebra_helpers.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Concurrent Modification] Can concurrent access to the BTreeMap at line 80 cause race conditions if multiple threads process gas expressions simultaneously? (Medium)"
