  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Consensus Safety] Can a Byzantine validator craft two different BlockInfo structures with identical epoch/round/id but different executed_state_id values to trigger InconsistentBlockInfo, causing honest validators to reject valid commits and halt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [State Divergence] If InconsistentBlockInfo is triggered due to non-deterministic execution results, can this cause permanent chain splits where different validator subsets commit to different state roots for the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the reconfiguration suffix block timestamp adjustment logic in BlockInfo.match_ordered_only() to bypass InconsistentBlockInfo detection and commit blocks with manipulated timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Version Mismatch] Does the InconsistentBlockInfo error properly validate that the version field matches between ordered and executed BlockInfo, or can version discrepancies allow double-spending by committing transactions at wrong heights? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Epoch Boundary Attack] During epoch transitions, can a malicious validator provide inconsistent next_epoch_state in BlockInfo to trigger InconsistentBlockInfo selectively, preventing honest validators from transitioning epochs and causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Error Handling] When InconsistentBlockInfo is returned in reset() method, is the error properly propagated to prevent silent failures that could allow validators to continue with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Serialization Attack] Since InconsistentBlockInfo contains two BlockInfo structs, can an attacker craft maliciously large BlockInfo structures to cause memory exhaustion or deserialization DoS when the error is serialized/logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Race Condition] In the decoupled execution pipeline, can race conditions between ordering and execution phases cause transient InconsistentBlockInfo errors that lead to unnecessary resets and consensus slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Hash Collision] If a hash collision occurs in BlockInfo.id or executed_state_id fields, will InconsistentBlockInfo error detection fail to catch actual inconsistencies, allowing invalid state commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: InconsistentBlockInfo] [Error Display] Does the Display implementation for InconsistentBlockInfo reveal sensitive information about validator state that could be exploited by network observers to predict consensus behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Generic Error Abuse] Since VerificationError is a generic error with no additional context, can this be abused to hide specific verification failures, making it impossible to distinguish between signature verification failures and other critical security checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Signature Bypass] In the consensus pipeline execution_client.rs, can a malicious validator trigger VerificationError to bypass signature verification on commit messages, allowing unauthorized commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Error Propagation] When VerificationError is converted to StateSyncError, is the original verification failure context preserved, or can attackers exploit information loss to retry failed attacks without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Liveness Attack] Can a Byzantine validator intentionally trigger VerificationError on valid blocks to force unnecessary sync operations and degrade network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Cryptographic Check Bypass] Does VerificationError cover all cryptographic verification failures (BLS signatures, VRF proofs, Merkle proofs), or can certain verification bypasses occur without triggering this error? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [State Sync Exploitation] When state sync encounters VerificationError during bootstrapping, can an attacker provide malicious state snapshots that pass initial checks but fail later verification, corrupting the validator's state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Error Logging] Since VerificationError has no associated data, does error logging provide sufficient information to audit and detect systematic verification attacks targeting specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: VerificationError] [Replay Attack] If VerificationError is triggered by replayed messages, can attackers use this to infer which messages have already been processed and time their attacks accordingly? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Channel Poisoning] In execution_client.rs reset() method, can a malicious component intentionally drop the reset channel sender to trigger ResetDropped, preventing buffer manager resets and causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Graceful Shutdown Bypass] When ResetDropped occurs during epoch transitions, can this prevent proper cleanup of the old epoch's state, leading to resource leaks or state corruption in the new epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Sync Failure] When sync_to_target() encounters ResetDropped error, does the system properly handle the failure, or can it lead to validators operating with stale state while believing they are synchronized? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Deadlock Scenario] Can a race condition between buffer manager shutdown and reset requests cause ResetDropped to occur at critical moments, creating deadlocks in the consensus pipeline? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Acknowledgment Loss] Since reset operations use oneshot channels for acknowledgment, if ResetDropped occurs after sending ResetRequest but before receiving ResetAck, can this leave the buffer manager in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Cascade Failure] If ResetDropped error is not properly handled in execution_client.rs, can this cascade to other components and trigger wider system failures beyond the buffer manager? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/errors.rs] [Error: ResetDropped] [Error Recovery] When ResetDropped is encountered, is there a retry mechanism or does the system permanently fail, potentially requiring manual validator restart? (Medium)"
