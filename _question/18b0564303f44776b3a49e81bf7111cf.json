  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Missing TLS enforcement] Does the validation ensure TLS is used when required, or can an attacker downgrade to plaintext 'redis://' when 'rediss://' should be mandatory for sensitive environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Default port assumptions] If no port is specified in 'redis://host', does the system assume port 6379, and could this default to an unexpected service if the host runs Redis on a non-standard port? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Hostname whitelist bypass] Is there an allowlist of valid Redis hostnames, and if not, can an attacker connect to any reachable Redis server including public internet servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Network segment restriction missing] Does validation enforce that Redis URLs must point to specific network segments (e.g., private network only), or can attackers specify public internet addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Integration: multiple services] [URL inconsistency across services] Do cache-worker, data-service, and file-store all interpret RedisUrl identically, or could differences in how they extract host/port/db from the URL cause inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Integration: connection pooling] [Connection pool exhaustion] Can an attacker cause services to create excessive Redis connections by manipulating URLs to have different connection pool keys, exhausting file descriptors or connection limits? (Medium)"
