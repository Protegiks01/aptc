  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [JSON Injection] Does serde_json::from_str on line 162 properly validate nested JSON structure, or can an attacker inject deeply nested objects to cause stack overflow or DoS during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft currency JSON with mismatched types (e.g., decimals as string instead of u8) to bypass validation or cause deserialization errors that leak information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [Malicious Metadata] Does the Currency type validation prevent attackers from injecting arbitrary metadata fields that could be misinterpreted by downstream systems as legitimate currency properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [Symbol Spoofing] Can an attacker create a currency with symbol 'APT' but different metadata to spoof the native coin and trick users into accepting worthless tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [Decimal Overflow] If decimals field is set to u8::MAX (255), could this cause arithmetic overflow when calculating actual amounts from atomic units? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Operator Hijacking] Can a malicious actor call set_operator without proper stake pool ownership validation, allowing unauthorized operator changes that redirect staking rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Old Operator Bypass] The old_operator field is optional (line 213) - does this allow bypassing operator change authorization by omitting the current operator, potentially enabling unauthorized operator rotation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Operator Collision] Can an attacker set new_operator to an address that's already an operator for another stake pool, causing conflicts in reward distribution or governance voting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Self-Assignment] Is there validation preventing sender from setting themselves as operator? Could this create circular dependencies or bypass delegation mechanisms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [System Address] Can an attacker set new_operator to a system address (0x0, 0x1) to break staking operations or gain unauthorized privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Sequence Number Race] If multiple set_operator transactions are submitted with different sequence numbers, can they create race conditions leading to unintended final operator state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Expired Operator Change] If the transaction expires (via expiry_time), does the operator change get reverted or does it remain in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Gas Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit operator changes with insufficient gas, causing failed transactions that still increment sequence numbers and potentially lock the stake pool in a bad state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Voter Authority Bypass] Can an attacker change the voter without proper operator authorization by exploiting the optional operator field (line 266), allowing unauthorized governance control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Voting Power Hijack] Does set_voter properly validate that the new_voter isn't already registered with another stake pool, preventing double-voting or vote weight manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Governance Griefing] Can an attacker set new_voter to an address they don't control (e.g., 0x0 or a non-existent account), effectively revoking voting rights and causing governance deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Voter Rotation Attack] Can rapid voter changes (multiple set_voter transactions in sequence) be exploited to confuse voting tallies or double-vote in ongoing governance proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Transaction Ordering] If set_voter and governance vote transactions are submitted in the same block, which takes precedence? Can this be exploited for vote manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Operator Field Confusion] When operator is None vs Some, does this change the authorization logic? Can an attacker exploit ambiguity between operator-authorized and owner-authorized voter changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Self-Voting] Can new_voter be set to the same address as sender or operator, creating self-voting scenarios that might bypass delegation rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Duplicate Pool Creation] Can an attacker create multiple stake pools for the same sender address, causing state confusion or enabling double-staking attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Commission Overflow] The commission_percentage is Option<u64> (line 328) - can an attacker set values >100 to extract more than 100% of rewards, causing negative balances or fund loss for delegators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Zero Stake Pool] When amount is None or 0 (line 325), does this create a valid but non-functional stake pool that can still receive delegated stake and extract commissions without providing validator services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Operator Preemption] Can an attacker create a stake pool with operator/voter set to addresses they don't control, preemptively claiming those roles before the legitimate operator can? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [All Optional Fields] Since operator, voter, amount, and commission_percentage are all optional (lines 318-328), what happens when all are None? Does this create an unusable stake pool that wastes state storage? (Medium)"
