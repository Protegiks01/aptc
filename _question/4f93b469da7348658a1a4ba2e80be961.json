  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Sequence number manipulation] The create_event_v1() method in MoveEventV1Type increments handle count, but if the EventHandle is corrupted or manipulated, could sequence numbers be duplicated allowing event replay within the same collection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Idempotency violation] If a CreateCollectionEvent is emitted but the collection creation transaction fails during execution, can the event still be recorded in event logs causing indexers to show non-existent collections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial deserialization] If BCS deserialization fails partway through (e.g., after creator and collection_name but before maximum), could partially initialized events be stored in caches causing inconsistent state reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Maximum mismatch] If the maximum value in the event differs from the on-chain maximum stored in the Collection resource, which value should indexers trust, and can this discrepancy be exploited to mint beyond limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: collection_name()] [Case sensitivity] Are collection names case-sensitive during uniqueness checks, and can attackers create 'MyCollection' vs 'mycollection' to bypass collision detection in Move while indexers treat them as distinct? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [TOCTOU race] Between event emission and indexer processing, if the on-chain collection state is modified (e.g., maximum changed via governance), can the stale event data cause indexers to show incorrect collection parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Concurrent deserialization] If multiple threads attempt to deserialize the same event bytes simultaneously, does BCS deserialization have any mutable static state that could cause data races or incorrect values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE] [Initialization race] The Lazy<TypeTag> could be accessed by multiple threads during first initialization - if two threads simultaneously trigger the closure, could the TypeTag be constructed inconsistently with different type_args or module names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Getter methods] [Concurrent modification] If an event struct is behind a RwLock and one thread calls getter methods while another modifies fields through unsafe code, could readers observe torn reads or inconsistent multi-field state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Creator authentication] Since the creator field is just an AccountAddress without accompanying signature proof, how is it verified that events were actually emitted by transactions authenticated by that address, preventing creator spoofing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Hash collision] If events are indexed by hashing their BCS bytes, could attackers find hash collisions between different CreateCollectionEvent instances to overwrite or corrupt indexer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Merkle proof forgery] If events are part of transaction Merkle proofs, can the lack of internal integrity checks (no MAC/signature in the event itself) allow attackers to forge event inclusion proofs for non-existent collections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] The try_from_bytes() returns generic anyhow::Result without specific error types - if deserialization fails, how do indexers distinguish malicious input from corrupted storage, potentially treating attacks as benign errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: uri()] [SSRF vulnerability] If indexers automatically fetch the uri content for validation or caching, can attackers use internal IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254) to probe internal networks or cloud metadata services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [GraphQL injection] When collection_name, uri, and description are exposed via GraphQL APIs, are they properly sanitized, or can attackers inject GraphQL query fragments that leak sensitive data from other collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: description()] [LDAP injection] If the description field is used in LDAP queries by enterprise indexers for access control, can attackers inject LDAP filter syntax (*)(uid=*))(&(uid=*) to bypass authentication? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Front-running] Can attackers monitor mempool for CreateCollectionEvent transactions and front-run them by creating collections with identical or similar names to squat valuable collection namespaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: maximum()] [Supply manipulation] If the maximum field can be set to 1 (single NFT) but indexers don't enforce this uniqueness, can creators mint multiple tokens violating scarcity assumptions used for pricing/trading? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Metadata inflation] By creating collections with maximum-length uri and description fields containing meaningless data, can attackers bloat blockchain state storage costs disproportionately to their gas payment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: collection_name()] [Namespace squatting] Since there's no prevention of similar names in the type system, can attackers register collections like 'BoredApes' vs 'BoredApes ' (trailing space) to phish users on indexers with poor sanitization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [ABI incompatibility] If the Move token module adds new fields to CreateCollectionEvent struct but the Rust type is not updated, will old nodes crash when deserializing new events, causing network splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Gas metering bypass] Since event deserialization happens off-chain in indexers without gas limits, can attackers emit events with computational bombs (deeply nested structures) that DoS indexer infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Event emission bypass] Can Move code emit raw ContractEvent structs that bypass CreateCollectionEvent validation, allowing creation of malformed events that break invariants assumed by this Rust type? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE] [Type registry pollution] If malicious modules register TypeTags that collide with CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE, could event routing be hijacked to deliver collection events to attacker-controlled handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Non-deterministic serialization] Does the derived Serialize implementation produce deterministic byte output for the same logical event, or could field ordering differences cause hash mismatches in Merkle trees? (Medium)"
