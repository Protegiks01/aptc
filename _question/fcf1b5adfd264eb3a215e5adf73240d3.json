  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [Creator Address Validation] Does TokenDataId validate that the creator address is not a reserved system address, preventing attackers from spoofing tokens as originating from trusted system contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [Clone Performance] When TokenDataId containing very long strings is cloned repeatedly during event processing, can this cause performance degradation that enables denial-of-service attacks on validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module Name Mismatch] Can the hardcoded MODULE_NAME ('token') be manipulated through module aliasing or namespace confusion to reference a malicious module with the same name, causing type confusion in Move VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct Name Collision] Can another contract define a struct with the same STRUCT_NAME ('TokenDeposit') in a different module, causing event type confusion when deserializing events from bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [IdentStr Safety] Are the ident_str! macros guaranteed to produce valid Move identifiers, or can malformed identifiers cause panics or undefined behavior in the Move VM type system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Version Confusion] Does the MoveEventV2Type implementation ensure backward compatibility with V1 events, or can mixing V1 and V2 token deposit events cause deserialization errors and loss of deposit records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Emission] Can the empty trait implementation be exploited to emit TokenDeposit events from unauthorized contracts that don't actually transfer tokens, creating false deposit records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Static: TOKEN_DEPOSIT_TYPE] [Lazy Initialization Race] Can concurrent access to TOKEN_DEPOSIT_TYPE during first initialization cause race conditions that result in multiple instances being created with inconsistent type information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Static: TOKEN_DEPOSIT_TYPE] [Token Address Constant] Is TOKEN_ADDRESS guaranteed to match the actual deployed address of the token module, or can address mismatches cause type validation failures and event processing errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Static: TOKEN_DEPOSIT_TYPE] [Type Args Validation] Does the empty type_args vector correctly represent a non-generic TokenDeposit type, or can this be exploited to instantiate generic type arguments and bypass type safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Static: TOKEN_DEPOSIT_TYPE] [StructTag Manipulation] Can the Box<StructTag> be manipulated after initialization to change the module or struct name, causing type confusion in event filtering or indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Serde Serialization] [BCS Format Mismatch] Can differences between Serde serialization and BCS encoding cause inconsistencies when TokenDeposit is serialized for different purposes (events vs storage vs network), breaking state integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Serde Serialization] [Endianness Issues] When TokenDeposit is serialized on different architectures (big-endian vs little-endian), can the u64 amount field be interpreted differently, causing token amount discrepancies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Serde Serialization] [Nested Depth Limit] Can deeply nested TokenId and TokenDataId structures exceed Serde's recursion limits during serialization, causing validator crashes when processing complex deposit events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Debug Trait] [Information Leakage] Does the Debug implementation for TokenDeposit, TokenId, and TokenDataId leak sensitive information in logs that could be exploited by attackers monitoring validator logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Debug Trait] [Format String Injection] Can malicious strings in collection or name fields exploit format string vulnerabilities when Debug::fmt is called, potentially causing crashes or information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Memory Safety] [String Memory Leaks] Can the String fields in TokenDataId cause memory leaks if not properly dropped when TokenDeposit events are discarded, eventually exhausting validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Memory Safety] [Reference Counting] If TokenDeposit is wrapped in Rc or Arc for concurrent access, can circular references prevent proper cleanup and cause memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Emission] [Replay Attacks] Can TokenDeposit events be replayed by capturing and re-emitting them in different transactions, causing duplicate credits to recipient accounts and inflating token supplies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Emission] [Event Ordering] When multiple TokenDeposit events are emitted in a single transaction, can race conditions or non-deterministic ordering cause inconsistent event processing across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Emission] [Transaction Reversion] If a transaction emits TokenDeposit events but then reverts, are the events properly rolled back, or can phantom deposits be recorded in event logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Event Emission] [Gas Metering] Is the gas cost of emitting TokenDeposit events (including string serialization) properly metered to prevent spam attacks that flood the event system with low-cost deposit events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Move Integration] [Type Safety Bypass] Can the Rust-side TokenDeposit struct definition diverge from the Move-side definition, allowing deserialization of events that violate Move's type safety invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Move Integration] [Resource Safety] Does the Move VM enforce that TokenDeposit events are only emitted when actual token resources are transferred, or can empty events be created without corresponding resource movements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Move Integration] [Capability Checks] Are proper capabilities required to emit TokenDeposit events, or can any contract emit deposit events to arbitrary accounts, breaking access control? (Critical)"
