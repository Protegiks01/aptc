  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: BlockSynchronizationKillSwitch] [DoS Attack] Can a malicious implementation of interrupt_requested() always return true to prevent all transaction execution, causing complete loss of liveness and halting the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: BlockSynchronizationKillSwitch] [Race Condition] If interrupt_requested() is called concurrently during parallel block execution (Block-STM), can race conditions cause partial transaction execution leading to state inconsistency across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Struct: NoopBlockSynchronizationKillSwitch] [Validation Bypass] Can an attacker swap NoopBlockSynchronizationKillSwitch with a malicious implementation to interrupt critical system transactions like validator updates or governance proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: BlockSynchronizationKillSwitch] [Timing Attack] Can strategic timing of interrupt_requested() calls be exploited to halt execution only for specific transactions (e.g., slashing transactions), allowing malicious validators to avoid penalties?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: BlockSynchronizationKillSwitch] [State Corruption] If a transaction is interrupted mid-execution via interrupt_requested(), are partial state changes properly rolled back, or can this lead to corrupted state and consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker provide a malicious StateKey that returns crafted StateValue data to poison the resource cache and cause incorrect transaction execution across the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Type Confusion] Does the function properly validate that the returned StateValue matches the expected resource type, or can type confusion allow reading arbitrary memory as typed resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Error Handling] When get_resource_state_value() returns Err, does the error properly prevent transaction execution, or can error handling bugs allow proceeding with invalid/missing resource data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_bytes()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker query resources with extremely large StateValue bytes to cause memory exhaustion during bytes().clone(), leading to validator crashes and liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_bytes()] [Race Condition] If get_resource_bytes() is called concurrently for the same resource during parallel execution, can cloning bytes lead to inconsistent reads and validation failures? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [Validation Bypass] Does metadata retrieval validate the resource actually exists before returning metadata, or can this be exploited to get metadata for non-existent resources and bypass existence checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_size()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker create resources with sizes exceeding u64::MAX to cause integer overflow in size calculations, leading to incorrect gas charging and free storage?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_exists()] [TOCTOU Race] In parallel execution, can a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use race between resource_exists() check and actual resource access allow double-spending or unauthorized resource modification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_exists()] [State Inconsistency] Can resource_exists() return inconsistent results across validators due to storage errors, causing non-deterministic execution and consensus failure? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_group_size()] [Integer Overflow] Can the ResourceGroupSize calculation overflow when aggregating all_tagged_resources_size, allowing attackers to wrap around to small values and bypass storage fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_group_size()] [Estimation Attack] Can malicious parallel execution provide incorrect size estimates that pass validation but lead to wrong gas charges, enabling economic attacks on validators? (High)",
