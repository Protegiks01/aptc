(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: parse_multi_signature()] [Signer confusion] Does the override_address parameter at line 150 properly override the sender address in multi-signature scenarios, or can this cause confusion between actual signer and recorded signer?
