  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [Port Range Validation] Can the port field be set to 0, negative values, or values >65535 that cause binding failures or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [u16 Overflow] Although u16 prevents overflow, can deserialization of large integers (>65535) cause truncation or unexpected wrapping behavior in serde? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Struct: InspectionServiceConfig] [Privilege Escalation] Can a non-validator node (fullnode, VFN) enable expose_configuration to access validator-only information by exploiting missing node type checks in the inspection service implementation? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Permission Bypass] Does the sanitizer enforce that only authorized operators can set expose_configuration=true on testnet validators, or can any node operator enable it without restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep Copy Issues] When InspectionServiceConfig is cloned, are all sensitive flags properly copied, or can pointer aliasing or shallow copies lead to configuration corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Timing Side Channel] Does the PartialEq implementation compare expose_* flags in constant time, or can timing differences leak configuration state? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [IPv6 Handling] Does the address field properly handle IPv6 addresses (e.g., '::1', '[::]'), or can IPv6 binding create unintended network exposure? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [Localhost Bypass] Can an attacker set address to '127.0.0.1' for local-only binding, then exploit IPv6 '::1' or DNS rebinding to access the service remotely? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [Wildcard Security] Is binding to '0.0.0.0' explicitly documented as insecure for production, or can operators unknowingly expose inspection endpoints to the internet? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Config Reload] [Runtime Updates] If InspectionServiceConfig is reloaded during runtime, can expose_* flag changes be applied without restarting the service, potentially disabling security restrictions mid-operation? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Config Persistence] [State Persistence] Are exposure flags persisted to disk in a way that survives node restarts, or can restarts reset to insecure defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Import: serde_yaml] [Dependency CVE] Are there known vulnerabilities in the serde_yaml version used that could enable YAML parsing attacks during config loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Import: ChainId] [Type Safety] Does ChainId properly validate chain IDs to prevent ID spoofing or injection attacks that bypass is_mainnet() checks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Audit Logging] When sanitization fails for mainnet validators, is the error logged with sufficient detail for security monitoring, or can attacks go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Config Changes] When optimize() modifies exposure flags, are changes logged for audit trails, or can unauthorized modifications occur silently? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Multi-Validator] [Coordinated Attack] Can multiple Byzantine validators coordinate to expose their inspection endpoints simultaneously, leaking enough information to compromise network security? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Load Balancing] [Proxy Bypass] If inspection endpoints are behind a load balancer or proxy, can attackers bypass authentication/authorization to access exposed validator data? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Testnet Assumptions] Does the optimizer assume testnet validators have no value at stake, potentially enabling excessive information exposure on valuable testnet networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Mainnet Definition] Is 'mainnet' precisely defined, or can future chains (mainnet-beta, mainnet-v2) bypass the is_mainnet() check? (Medium)",
