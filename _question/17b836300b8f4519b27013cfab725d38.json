  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [Match Return Type] All match arms return Option<usize>, ensuring type consistency. However, could compiler optimizations change the codegen in a way that affects the returned value? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Non-Deterministic Gas] If log2_floor produces different results on different validator architectures, the gas calculations for cryptographic operations would diverge, causing validators to disagree on transaction costs and state roots. Could this happen? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [MSM Cost Divergence] Since log2_ceil affects MSM cost calculations through window size, could platform-specific differences cause some validators to accept transactions that others reject due to gas limit differences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Floating Point Contamination] While these functions use only integer operations, could any downstream code inadvertently convert results to f64 for calculations, introducing non-deterministic floating point behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [State Root Divergence] If log2_ceil affects gas consumption, and gas consumption affects state (via gas fees), could divergent log2_ceil results cause validators to compute different state roots, forking the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Transaction Replay] If gas calculations are non-deterministic due to log2_floor variations, could a transaction be accepted on one chain fork but rejected on another, causing consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Branch Prediction] The if n == 0 check is a branch. For cryptographic operations called in tight loops, could branch misprediction on this check cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [Match Performance] The match statement has 3 arms (0, 1, _). Is the match compiled efficiently, or could it introduce overhead in hot paths like MSM window calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Inlining] Is log2_floor marked for inlining? If called frequently in cryptographic operations, failure to inline could cause function call overhead and cache misses. (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [Recursive Call] log2_ceil calls log2_floor, which is another function call. Could this double function call overhead affect performance in hot cryptographic loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [leading_zeros() Performance] Is the leading_zeros() intrinsic a single CPU instruction or multiple operations? If slow on certain architectures, could it become a bottleneck? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Gas Arbitrage] If an attacker can predict how log2_floor affects gas costs for different input sizes, could they optimize transaction batching to exploit gas pricing inefficiencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [MSM Cost Optimization] By carefully choosing the number of scalar-point pairs in MSM operations, could an attacker find sweet spots where log2_ceil-based window sizing gives disproportionately low gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Validator Resource Exhaustion] Even if gas is charged correctly based on log2_floor, could the actual computational cost differ significantly from the gas cost, allowing resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_ceil()] [Threshold Gaming] The ark_msm_window_size function uses log2_ceil only for num_entries >= 32. Could attackers exploit the 31/32 threshold to get favorable pricing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/helpers.rs] [Function: log2_floor()] [Asymmetric Cost Attack] If log2_floor-based gas charging doesn't accurately reflect actual CPU cost for certain input ranges, could attackers perform disproportionately expensive operations at minimal cost? (High)"
