(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Duplicate Registration] Does the natives array allow duplicate function registrations with the same module name and function name, potentially causing ambiguity in function resolution and allowing attackers to override critical functions like ed25519_verify with malicious implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Function Replacement] Can the native function table be modified after initialization through make_table_from_iter, allowing runtime replacement of critical functions like signature verification with attacker-controlled implementations leading to authentication bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Address Validation] Is the diem_framework_addr parameter validated to ensure it matches expected system addresses, or can malicious code register natives under arbitrary addresses to impersonate the framework and gain unauthorized privileges?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Memory Safety] Are the Arc-wrapped native functions properly synchronized when accessed concurrently from multiple VM instances, or could race conditions in function pointer dereferencing lead to memory corruption or use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type Safety] Does make_table_from_iter validate that all registered native functions have compatible signatures, or can type mismatches between Move declarations and Rust implementations cause type confusion vulnerabilities when executing native calls?
