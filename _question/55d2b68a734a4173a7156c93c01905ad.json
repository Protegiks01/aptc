  "[File: aptos-core/storage/scratchpad/src/sparse_merkle/mod.rs] [Function: freeze()] [Assert bypass in release] assert!(base_smt.is_family(self)) only in debug, but is there runtime validation in release builds to prevent freezing incompatible trees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/scratchpad/src/sparse_merkle/mod.rs] [Function: new_node_hashes_since()] [Assert family check] assert!(since_smt.is_family(self)) can be disabled in release, allowing unrelated trees to be compared causing wrong node hash collection? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/scratchpad/src/sparse_merkle/utils.rs] [Function: partition()] [Debug_assert prefix] debug_assert! for common_prefix_bits_len is removed in release, can this cause partition to group updates from different subtrees together? (Critical)",
