  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Input validation] Can a malicious governance proposal inject a gas schedule with extremely large u64 values (near u64::MAX) in the BTreeMap that could cause integer overflow during gas calculations in the VM, leading to transactions executing for free and draining validator resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Consensus divergence] If implementations of this trait do not validate input consistently, could different validators parse the same on-chain gas schedule BTreeMap differently, resulting in non-deterministic gas calculations and consensus failure due to divergent state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [DoS via zero gas costs] Can an attacker exploit governance to set all gas parameters to zero through a malicious BTreeMap, enabling free transaction execution that overwhelms validators and causes total network liveness failure?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [String key injection] Does the trait enforce validation on String keys in the BTreeMap, or can an attacker inject keys with special characters, unicode exploits, or extremely long strings that cause parser crashes or memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Missing data handling] The trait documentation states 'None should be returned when the gas schedule is missing some required entries' - but can implementations disagree on what constitutes 'required', causing some validators to accept a gas schedule while others reject it, leading to network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Error string manipulation] Since this method returns Result<Self, String>, can an attacker craft inputs that cause implementations to return different error messages, and could these error messages leak sensitive information about validator state or create non-deterministic behavior?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Partial deserialization] The documentation states 'Unused entries should be safely ignored' - but what if an implementation incorrectly processes 'unused' entries, could this lead to unexpected state changes or memory corruption when malicious extra data is present in the BTreeMap? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Replay attack via feature version] Can an attacker replay an old gas schedule by manipulating feature_version to load historical gas parameters that are incompatible with current protocol rules, causing execution failures or consensus divergence?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Determinism requirement] Does the trait specification enforce deterministic deserialization behavior across different Rust compiler versions, CPU architectures, or operating systems, or could subtle differences cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/traits.rs] [Trait: FromOnChainGasSchedule, Method: from_on_chain_gas_schedule()] [Panic during deserialization] If an implementation panics instead of returning an error Result during malformed input handling, can this be exploited to crash validator nodes at critical consensus moments, causing liveness failures?
