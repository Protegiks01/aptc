  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [TypeParameter expansion] TypeParameter tokens are ignored - could an attacker use type parameters as indirection to create recursive structures that are only detected after generic instantiation? (Critical)",
