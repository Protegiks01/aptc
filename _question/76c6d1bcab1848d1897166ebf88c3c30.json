  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Struct: GRPCNetworkMessageServiceServerWrapper] [Arc overhead] The inbound_handlers is wrapped in Arc<Mutex<>> - is there any scenario where the Arc reference count could overflow or underflow, causing use-after-free or memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Deadlock potential] If a message handler tries to send a response by calling back into this service, can this create deadlocks with the Mutex if the callback is synchronous? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Epoch boundary handling] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can messages from old epoch validators be processed, potentially violating reconfiguration safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Validator set enforcement] There's no check that the sender is in the current validator set - can removed validators continue sending messages after being kicked out, potentially interfering with consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: send_message()] [Message authenticity] Messages are sent without signatures attached at this layer - can a compromised network node modify messages in transit before they reach the handler where signatures might be checked? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Round synchronization] If consensus messages arrive out of round order, can this cause handlers to buffer messages excessively, leading to memory exhaustion during long network partitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: start_async()] [Graceful shutdown] When server_shutdown_rx signals shutdown, are pending messages processed or dropped? Can this cause consensus messages to be lost during planned node restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: send_message()] [Connection cleanup] When does the client channel get closed? Can accumulated clients to different peers cause file descriptor leaks over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Struct: GRPCNetworkMessageServiceClientWrapper] [Resource leak] If the client is dropped while messages are in flight, are those messages and their resources properly cleaned up, or can this cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: start_async()] [Task leak] The server is spawned with rt.spawn() but there's no handle saved - can this prevent proper tracking of server task lifetime and cause resource leaks if shutdown fails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE] [Integer overflow] The value 1024 * 1024 * 80 is computed at compile time, but if message size calculations elsewhere use different integer types (u32 vs usize), can integer overflow cause incorrect size comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: start_async()] [Timeout overflow] The rpc_timeout_ms is converted to Duration::from_millis() - can extremely large timeout values cause integer overflow in duration arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: start_async()] [Timeout precision] Timeouts are in milliseconds - is this sufficient granularity for consensus timing requirements, or can rounding errors accumulate and cause timing-based consensus failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Zero-length messages] Can handlers properly handle zero-length message data? Could empty messages bypass validation logic in handlers expecting non-empty content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Unicode in message types] Can message_type contain unicode or special characters that might cause issues in logging, HashMap operations, or downstream string processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: send_message()] [Concurrent sends] If multiple threads call send_message() concurrently on the same client instance through shared ownership, does the &mut self requirement prevent this, or can unsafe code bypass this safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: start_async()] [Reflection service security] The reflection service exposes gRPC service definitions - can this information help attackers understand internal message structures and craft more sophisticated attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: get_channel()] [Connection retry] If initial connection fails, does connect_lazy() retry indefinitely? Can this cause client initialization to hang and prevent validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Metric cardinality explosion] If attackers can control remote_addr values, can they cause high cardinality in NETWORK_HANDLER_TIMER metrics labels, causing memory exhaustion in metrics collection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Proposal injection] Can an external attacker send forged block proposals to validators by calling this service directly, bypassing proposal generation logic and potentially causing validators to vote on invalid blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Vote manipulation] Without cryptographic verification at this layer, can Byzantine validators send votes with forged signatures or incorrect voting power, potentially breaking quorum certificate validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Equivocation enablement] Can a Byzantine validator send conflicting messages (e.g., two different votes for the same round) through this service without detection, enabling equivocation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: send_message()] [Consensus timing] The panic on send failure can cause validators to crash during critical consensus phases - can Byzantine nodes exploit this to prevent honest validators from participating in specific rounds, breaking liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/grpc_network_service/mod.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Safety rule bypass] If safety rules are enforced in handlers, can attackers craft messages that exploit race conditions between message arrival and safety rule checking to bypass double-signing prevention? (Critical)"
