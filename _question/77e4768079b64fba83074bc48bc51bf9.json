  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Float comparison safety] The code assumes latency is never NaN, but does it handle infinity values correctly, or can Inf/-Inf cause incorrect sorting? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [HashMap thread safety] While HashMap itself is not thread-safe, is access to network_senders properly synchronized when NetworkClient is used concurrently? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs & interface.rs] [Cross-component race] Can an attacker exploit the race between get_available_peers() reading cached data and send_to_peer() accessing current data, causing messages to be sent to peers that just disconnected? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs & interface.rs] [Metadata-protocol mismatch] Can peer metadata claim protocol support but the actual protocol negotiation fail, and if so, does NetworkClient handle this gracefully or crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs & metadata.rs] [State transition race] Can update_connection_state() and is_connected() race, where a peer is marked Disconnecting but is_connected() still returns true, causing messages to be sent during shutdown? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs & storage.rs] [Trust boundary violation] Can untrusted peer metadata from storage be used by NetworkClient without validation, allowing malicious peers to inject fake protocol support? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: subscribe() & broadcast()] [Notification ordering across subscribers] If subscriber A receives NewPeer for peer X but subscriber B's channel is full and drops the event, can this cause application-level inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [RPC ID exhaustion] If RPC request IDs are sequential/predictable, can an attacker pre-send spoofed responses to hijack legitimate RPC conversations? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: remove_peer_metadata()] [Cleanup verification] After removing peer metadata, are there dangling references elsewhere (e.g., in application caches) that could cause use-after-free style logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_sender_for_network_id()] [Sender invalidation] If the underlying NetworkSender becomes invalid (e.g., network shutdown), does get_sender_for_network_id() detect this, or can stale senders be returned? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs & interface.rs] [Trusted peer verification] When sending consensus-critical messages, does NetworkClient verify the recipient is in the trusted peer set, or can messages leak to untrusted peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Byte buffer aliasing] When to_bytes_by_protocol() clones bytes for multiple peers using the same protocol, are the Bytes objects properly independent, or can modifications affect multiple recipients? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_preferred_protocol_for_peer()] [Protocol upgrade rollback] During network protocol upgrades, can attackers force honest nodes to downgrade by selectively supporting only old protocols? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Protocol version confusion] If a peer reconnects with different protocol support, does insert_connection_metadata() handle protocol version changes safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [Protocol preference manipulation] Can the order of protocols in direct_send_protocols_and_preferences be manipulated at runtime to force preference of vulnerable protocols? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: supports_protocol()] [Protocol version granularity] Does ProtocolId distinguish between different versions of the same protocol, or can version confusion allow incompatible protocol versions to communicate? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Metrics timer] The OP_MEASURE timer tracks sort performance, but are there limits to prevent excessive sorting from degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Message broadcast metrics] When send_to_peers() fails to send to some peers, are failures tracked in metrics to detect systematic delivery issues? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Single peer optimization] Is there special handling when send_to_peers() is called with a single peer, or does it unnecessarily go through the grouping logic? (Low)",
