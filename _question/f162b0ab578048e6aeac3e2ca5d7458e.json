  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutateEvent] [Stack overflow] Can very large collection or token strings cause stack overflows when RoyaltyMutateEvent instances are created on the stack in recursive or deeply nested code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Event processing] [Indexer DoS] Can an attacker rapidly mutate royalties back and forth, generating thousands of events per second that overwhelm indexer processing capacity and cause indexers to fall behind, showing stale royalty data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Event processing] [Storage explosion] Can accumulation of royalty mutation events over time cause database storage exhaustion in indexers, especially if events contain large collection/token strings that aren't pruned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Event processing] [Query performance] Can queries for royalty history on tokens with thousands of mutations cause database query timeouts or excessive resource usage, enabling DoS attacks on API endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Front-running] Can a malicious creator monitor pending token sales and front-run them by mutating royalty to 100% right before sale execution, stealing the entire sale proceeds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Royalty bait-and-switch] Can creators set low royalties to attract buyers, then immediately mutate to high royalties after sale, where the event visibility doesn't prevent the economic harm to secondary buyers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Payee manipulation] Can the creator change new_royalty_payee_addr to an attacker-controlled address right before marketplace royalty distributions, redirecting legitimate royalties to the attacker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Compliance] [Audit trail] Do events provide sufficient information for regulatory compliance, or can missing details (timestamps, transaction context, rationale) make it impossible to audit suspicious royalty changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Compliance] [OFAC address] If new_royalty_payee_addr becomes a sanctioned address, does the event data allow marketplaces to retroactively identify and freeze royalty payments, or will they unknowingly send funds to sanctioned entities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum values] Can all u64 fields be set to u64::MAX simultaneously, and does this cause integer overflows in any downstream code that processes or combines these values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Identical old/new values] If all old_royalty_* fields equal their new_royalty_* counterparts, indicating no actual change, does this cause unnecessary events that waste storage and gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Special characters in names] Can collection or token strings contain special characters that break APIs, SQL queries, or file system operations when indexers try to cache or process the data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Very long strings] Can collection or token strings approach the maximum String size limits in Rust/Move, causing allocation failures or performance degradation during event creation or processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Migration] [Dual emission] During the module event migration period when both EventHandle events and module events are emitted, can the two event types diverge in content or ordering, causing indexers to see different royalty histories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Migration] [Missing events] If module_event_migration_enabled() feature flag flips during transaction execution, can events be dropped or duplicated, causing incomplete royalty mutation history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Migration] [Type confusion] Can the old RoyaltyMutateEvent (EventHandle-based) and new RoyaltyMutate (module event) types be confused during deserialization, causing type errors or silent data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Testing] [Fuzz testing] Has try_from_bytes() been fuzz-tested with random/malicious BCS input to ensure it doesn't panic, crash, or exhibit undefined behavior on invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Testing] [Property testing] Are there property-based tests verifying that serialization followed by deserialization is identity-preserving for all valid RoyaltyMutateEvent instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Testing] [Integration tests] Do end-to-end tests verify that events emitted from Move code correctly deserialize in Rust with no data loss or corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Protocol] [Event versioning] If the event structure needs to change in the future, is there a versioning mechanism to support both old and new formats without breaking existing indexers and APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Protocol] [Gas cost manipulation] Can the size of collection/token strings be manipulated to consume excessive gas during event emission, making royalty mutations prohibitively expensive as an economic DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate_event.rs] [Protocol] [Transaction ordering] In block-STM parallel execution, can royalty mutation transactions execute out of order, causing events to be emitted in non-chronological sequence and confusing indexers? (Medium)"
