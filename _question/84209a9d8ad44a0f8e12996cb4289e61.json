  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Chain fork] Can sync_to_target() be used to sync to a forked chain with valid signatures but different transaction history, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Timestamp validation] Does sync_to_target() validate that the target's timestamp is monotonically increasing, or can time-traveling attacks be mounted? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Validator set manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious EpochState with unauthorized validators in the verifier, allowing non-stakers to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Double initialization] Can new_epoch() be called multiple times for the same epoch, causing state confusion and allowing validators to operate with inconsistent epoch configurations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Payload manager injection] Can a malicious payload_manager implementation be injected that filters or reorders transactions to benefit attackers or censor specific users? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Transaction shuffler bypass] Can the transaction_shuffler parameter be set to a malicious implementation that breaks transaction ordering invariants or enables front-running? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Configuration injection] Can BlockExecutorConfigFromOnchain be manipulated to set gas prices to zero, disable transaction validation, or alter execution parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Deduper bypass] Can a malicious transaction_deduper allow duplicate transactions to be executed in the same block, enabling double-spending attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Randomness manipulation] Can the randomness_enabled flag be manipulated to disable randomness when it should be enabled, breaking protocols that depend on unpredictability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Consensus config override] Can OnChainConsensusConfig parameters be altered to reduce timeout values to zero, set infinite round durations, or disable safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Version downgrade] Can persisted_auxiliary_info_version be set to an older version to enable deprecated vulnerabilities or bypass security patches? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Network sender hijack] Can a malicious NetworkSender be injected to intercept, modify, or drop consensus messages, causing safety or liveness failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [State carryover] Are old epoch states properly cleared before applying new epoch configuration, or can stale state from previous epochs contaminate the new epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Concurrent reconfiguration] Can new_epoch() and end_epoch() be called concurrently, causing race conditions that leave the state computer in an undefined state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Missing validation] Does new_epoch() validate that the epoch number in EpochState is exactly one higher than the previous epoch, or can epochs be skipped? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Incomplete cleanup] Does end_epoch() fully clear all epoch-specific state including pending transactions, execution caches, and validator signatures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Premature call] Can end_epoch() be called before all blocks in the current epoch are committed, causing loss of uncommitted transactions and breaking safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Multiple calls] If end_epoch() is called multiple times, does it handle idempotency correctly or can it corrupt internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Resource leak] Does end_epoch() properly release all resources including memory, file handles, and network connections, or can repeated epoch transitions cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Callback orphaning] What happens to pending StateComputerCommitCallBackType closures when end_epoch() is called - are they safely dropped or can they execute with stale epoch state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Sync requirement] Does end_epoch() require that a sync_to call must happen before the next new_epoch(), and if this invariant is violated, can it cause state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Implementation trust] Does the trait require implementations to be cryptographically verified, or can malicious implementations be injected at runtime to compromise consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Async safety] Do the async trait methods (sync_for_duration, sync_to_target) handle cancellation correctly, or can task cancellation leave state in inconsistent intermediate states? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Error semantics] Do all methods have well-defined error recovery semantics, or can error returns leave the StateComputer in an undefined state requiring node restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Trait: StateComputer] [Method ordering] Are there required ordering constraints between methods (e.g., must call new_epoch before sync_to_target), and if violated, can this cause crashes or corruption? (High)"
