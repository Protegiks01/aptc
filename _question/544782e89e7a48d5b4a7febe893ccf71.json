  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Struct: NibblePath] [Clone cost] Does Clone implementation deeply copy bytes vector, and can cloning large NibblePaths during concurrent Merkle operations cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Struct: NibblePath] [Clone consistency] If NibblePath is cloned while being modified, can clone capture inconsistent state with mismatched num_nibbles and bytes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Struct: BitIterator] [Lifetime bound] Can BitIterator be stored and used after its underlying NibblePath is dropped, causing use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Struct: NibbleIterator] [Stale reference] Can NibbleIterator reference stale NibblePath data if path is modified through interior mutability patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: visited_nibbles()] [Iterator chain] Can chaining visited_nibbles() and remaining_nibbles() create iterators with overlapping or gaps in coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: from_iter()] [Gas exhaustion] Can malicious smart contract create extremely long iterators that consume excessive gas during from_iter() execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: skip_common_prefix()] [Performance attack] Can attacker craft NibblePaths with very long common prefixes causing skip_common_prefix to iterate excessively, degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: Debug::fmt()] [Log DoS] Can debug formatting of deeply nested NibblePaths cause log processing to hang or consume excessive CPU during error reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: get_shard_id()] [Shard overflow] Can get_shard_id() return values that exceed actual shard count in Jellyfish Merkle implementation, causing shard access errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: new_from_state_key()] [Tree depth] If state_key hashes collide in first num_nibbles, can Merkle tree grow beyond expected depth causing storage issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Function: truncate()] [Tree pruning] During Merkle tree pruning, can incorrect truncate() calls orphan nodes or create unreachable state? (High)"
