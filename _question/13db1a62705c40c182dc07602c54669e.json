  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Timestamp manipulation for consensus] Can incorrect ledger_timestamp values cause validators to disagree on block timestamps, potentially affecting timeout calculations or consensus progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response struct] [State commitment mismatch] If body contains state that doesn't match the version in ledger_info, can this cause Merkle proof verification failures affecting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Empty body handling] Can body be empty Vec<u8>? Does this cause issues with CONTENT_TYPE headers or client parsers expecting non-empty responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new_bcs()] [BCS canonicalization] Does BCS guarantee canonical encoding? Can the same logical data serialize to different byte sequences, causing hash mismatches? (High)",
