  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Error: Unwrap on stats send] [Panic on receiver drop] Do the .unwrap() calls at lines 211 and 230 properly handle receiver disconnection, or could this cause panics during cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Error: Unwrap on stats receive] [Panic on channel closure] Does the .unwrap() at line 239 handle channel closure gracefully, or could premature closure cause panics in the main thread? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Bypass: AsyncRateLimiter wrapping] [Wrapper bypass] Can an attacker bypass the AsyncRateLimiter wrapper by exploiting the underlying AsyncRead/AsyncWrite trait implementations to directly access the stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Bypass: Bucket configuration] [Zero-size bucket] Could passing size=0 to simple_shared_bucket at lines 265, 276, 292-293 create a rate limiter that blocks all traffic or allows unlimited traffic depending on implementation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Bypass: Multiple experiments] [State persistence] Could rate limiter state persist between experiments, causing the second test to have an already-full bucket that incorrectly shows burst capacity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Bypass: Chunk size manipulation] [Large chunk bypass] Could increasing CHUNK_SIZE to be larger than the rate limiter bucket size allow bursts that bypass per-second limits by transferring large chunks infrequently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Bypass: No rate limiting path] [Code path differences] Could the identity closures in test_no_rate_limit exercise different code paths than production, causing rate limiter bypass vulnerabilities to be missed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Timing: Instant measurements] [Clock precision] Does Instant::now() have sufficient precision to accurately measure per-chunk timing for rate limiting, or could coarse clocks allow burst transfers that bypass limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Timing: TCP buffer effects] [Buffer masking] Could TCP socket buffers mask rate limiter effectiveness by allowing large bursts to be buffered before backpressure occurs, making tests show passing when production would fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Timing: Async scheduling] [Scheduler unfairness] Could the tokio scheduler unfairly prioritize the writer over the reader (or vice versa), causing artificial rate limiting behavior that doesn't match production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Timing: Stats calculation] [Race in timing] Could the stats measurement at lines 129-131 introduce overhead that affects the measured throughput, causing rate limiter tests to appear more restrictive than they actually are? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: Localhost only] [Network difference] Do tests using localhost connections accurately represent real network conditions where latency and packet loss could affect rate limiter behavior in production validator nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: Single connection] [Concurrent connection bypass] Do single-connection tests properly validate rate limiter behavior when multiple connections share the same SharedBucket in production, potentially allowing aggregate bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: Sequential experiments] [Concurrent usage patterns] Could sequential testing miss race conditions that occur when multiple rate-limited connections operate concurrently in production validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: Fixed chunk size] [Variable message sizes] Could using fixed CHUNK_SIZE miss rate limiter bugs that only occur with variable-sized messages common in actual network protocols? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: Continuous transfer] [Bursty traffic] Does testing continuous transfers accurately represent bursty validator traffic patterns, or could rate limiters fail under burst conditions not tested here? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Test validity: No adversarial testing] [Attack pattern gaps] Do these benign throughput tests include adversarial scenarios where an attacker deliberately tries to bypass rate limits through timing or protocol manipulation? (High)"
