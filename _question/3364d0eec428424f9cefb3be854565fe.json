  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Edge Case] [Tolerance < 1.0] Can load_imbalance_tolerance < 1.0 cause group_size_limit to be smaller than necessary, creating excessive fragmentation that overwhelms the scheduler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Edge Case] [Very High Tolerance] At what threshold does load_imbalance_tolerance become so large (e.g., 100.0) that parallelism is completely defeated, and is this threshold validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Edge Case] [Fractional Results] When (block_size * tolerance / shards) produces a non-integer result, does the ceil() operation always round correctly, or could it round to 0 in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Observability] [Metrics Collection] Are there metrics that track the actual shard load distribution resulting from this config, allowing operators to detect when adversarial tolerance values are causing problems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Observability] [Anomaly Detection] Can the system detect when load_imbalance_tolerance produces pathological partitioning (e.g., all transactions in one shard) and alert operators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Observability] [Audit Logging] Are changes to load_imbalance_tolerance logged with sufficient detail to forensically analyze if configuration changes caused consensus or performance issues? (Low)"
