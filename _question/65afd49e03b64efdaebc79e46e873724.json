  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_to_temp()] [Predictable temp location] Does tempdir() create directories with unpredictable names, or can an attacker predict the temporary directory location and pre-create symlinks or malicious files there before write_to_temp() is called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_to_temp()] [Temp directory cleanup] When the returned TempDir is dropped, does cleanup properly handle cases where files were modified or replaced with symlinks, preventing cleanup failures or symlink-following deletions?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_to_temp()] [Temp directory exhaustion] Can repeatedly calling write_to_temp() without dropping the TempDir handles cause temporary directory exhaustion, filling up /tmp and causing system-wide issues? (Low)",
