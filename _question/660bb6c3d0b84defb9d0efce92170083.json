  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: create_commit_callback()] [Panic in callback] If handle_committed_blocks() panics, does the callback propagate panic to caller, potentially crashing the execution pipeline? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: create_commit_callback_deprecated()] [API deprecation race] Can mixing deprecated and new callback APIs cause inconsistent state updates where some commits use old logic and others new logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: create_commit_callback_deprecated()] [WrappedLedgerInfo ignored] Does the deprecated callback ignore the first parameter (WrappedLedgerInfo), and can this lead to missing important metadata in commit processing? (Low)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Struct: ObserverBlockData] [Root inconsistency] Can self.root become inconsistent with actual highest committed block in ordered_block_store, causing get_highest_committed_epoch_round() to return wrong values? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Edge case: empty stores] [Division by zero] Do any metric calculations or store operations assume non-empty stores, potentially causing panics when all stores are empty? (Low)",
