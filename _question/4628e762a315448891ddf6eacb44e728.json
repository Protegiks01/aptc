  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Seed exhaustion] Can an attacker enumerate all possible short seeds (e.g., 1-4 bytes) for a known source address to find collisions with high-value resource accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Determinism failure] Is create_resource_address() guaranteed to produce identical addresses on all platforms, or can floating-point operations, endianness, or BCS serialization differences cause address mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Error propagation] Does execute() properly propagate all errors from seed(), or can certain error conditions be silently ignored, leading to address derivation with default/empty seeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Scheme byte manipulation] Can the Scheme::DeriveResourceAccountAddress (0xFF) domain separator be exploited where attackers craft seeds ending in 0xFF to create ambiguity in the hash input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [BCS address encoding] Does the BCS encoding of the source address in create_resource_address() handle special addresses (0x0, MAX_ADDRESS) correctly without producing exploitable patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [SHA3-256 collision] While SHA3-256 collisions are theoretically infeasible, can the reduced address space (32 bytes) make birthday attacks practical for finding two different (address, seed) pairs that produce the same resource account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Seed concatenation] Can an attacker exploit the concatenation order (address || seed || scheme) to find seeds where substring manipulation creates collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: ResourceAccountSeed::seed()] [Error message leakage] Do error messages from HexEncodedBytes::from_str() expose internal implementation details or valid seed formats that aid attackers in crafting malicious inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: ResourceAccountSeed::seed()] [Panic on unwrap] Does bcs::to_bytes() unwrap safely for all possible string inputs, or can certain strings cause BCS serialization panics that crash the CLI? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: ResourceAccountSeed::seed()] [Empty seed handling] Can an attacker provide empty seeds that bypass validation and create resource accounts with predictable addresses based only on the source address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: ResourceAccountSeed::seed()] [Whitespace handling] Are leading/trailing whitespaces in seed strings properly trimmed before encoding, or do they become part of the seed bytes, causing address derivation inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Async execution race] Since execute() is async, can concurrent executions with the same parameters produce different results due to race conditions in the underlying address derivation logic?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Struct: ResourceAccountSeed] [Default value attack] Since seed_encoding defaults to BCS, can attackers exploit users who don't explicitly specify encoding to create addresses that don't match their expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Struct: DeriveResourceAccount] [Address parser] Does the load_account_arg parser properly validate address formats, or can malformed addresses bypass validation and cause unexpected behavior in create_resource_address()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Struct: DeriveResourceAccount] [Alias confusion] Can the --account alias for --address create confusion where users provide account names instead of addresses, leading to wrong address derivation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: SeedEncoding::fmt()] [Display consistency] Can inconsistencies between Display output and FromStr parsing be exploited where displayed encoding strings don't round-trip correctly through parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: SeedEncoding::fmt()] [String injection] Can an attacker exploit format string vulnerabilities in the Display implementation to inject control sequences that manipulate CLI output? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: ResourceAccountSeed::seed()] [Seed length limits] Is there a maximum seed length enforced, or can unlimited-length seeds cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion during address derivation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Preimage attack] While SHA3-256 is preimage-resistant, can the structured input format (address || seed || 0xFF) reduce the effective hash strength? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/derive_resource_account.rs] [Function: DeriveResourceAccount::execute()] [Off-chain vs on-chain mismatch] Can differences between the CLI's address derivation and the on-chain Move implementation cause addresses to mismatch, leading to funds being sent to wrong accounts?
