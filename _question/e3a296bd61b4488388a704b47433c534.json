  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: into_change_set] [PartialVMResult error types] Can PartialVMResult errors be misinterpreted by the VM, causing incorrect transaction execution outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Struct: NativeAggregatorContext] [Tid trait safety] Is the Tid trait (from better_any) properly implemented to prevent type ID collisions with other native contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: into_change_set] [Value type safety] Can aggregator values (u128) be reinterpreted as other types during Move VM execution, bypassing type safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: SessionListener::start] [Session hash generation] Can session_hash be predictable or collision-prone, allowing attackers to forge session identities and hijack transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: SessionListener::start] [Multiple start calls] Can start() be called multiple times on the same context, causing session state to be reinitialized mid-transaction and corrupting aggregator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: SessionListener::finish] [Finish without start] Can finish() be called without start(), causing undefined behavior or accessing uninitialized session state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/context.rs] [Function: SessionListener::abort] [Abort without cleanup] Can abort() be called after into_change_set() has consumed the context, causing use-after-move errors? (High)"
