  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Busy Wait] Does lock_exclusive() implement exponential backoff when the lock is contended, or does it busy-wait consuming CPU resources, potentially causing performance degradation during high lock contention? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Lock Contention] In scenarios where hundreds of Move package compilations occur simultaneously, can excessive lock contention on shared cache resources cause build times to increase exponentially rather than linearly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Privilege Escalation] Can a lower-privileged process create lock files in directories owned by higher-privileged processes, potentially enabling denial-of-service attacks against system-level Move package operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [SELinux/AppArmor] Do mandatory access control systems (SELinux, AppArmor) properly restrict lock file creation, or can confined processes escape their sandbox by manipulating lock files in shared directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: drop()] [Permission Escalation] If lock files are created with setuid/setgid bits or special permissions, can their removal in drop() be blocked by access control rules, causing lock file accumulation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Struct: FileLock] [Lock Verification] Is there any mechanism to verify that a FileLock actually holds the exclusive lock it claims to hold, or can stale FileLock objects be used after their locks have been released, causing false assumptions about exclusivity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Lock Reacquisition] If the same process tries to reacquire a lock on the same path it already holds, does it deadlock with itself, or does lock_exclusive() detect and prevent this scenario? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Struct: FileLock] [IPC Security] Can lock files be used as a covert channel for inter-process communication by encoding data in lock file names or timing patterns, potentially leaking sensitive information about Move package builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Lock Metadata] Does the lock file store any metadata about the locking process (PID, timestamp, etc.), and if not, how can orphaned locks be detected and cleaned up safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Container Volumes] When lock files are created on Docker volumes shared between containers, can lock semantics break due to kernel namespace isolation or volume driver limitations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: drop()] [Container Cleanup] If a Docker container is force-stopped while holding locks, are lock files properly cleaned up by the container runtime, or do they persist in volumes causing subsequent builds to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Timeout Testing] Can the alert_timeout mechanism be tested reliably, or do timing-dependent tests introduce flakiness that masks real bugs in lock acquisition logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Lock Metrics] Is there any instrumentation to track lock acquisition times, contention rates, or failure modes, and without it, can performance degradation due to lock issues go undetected in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Empty Path] If lock_path is an empty string or contains only whitespace, does File::create() fail gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Unicode Paths] Can lock paths with special Unicode characters (e.g., zero-width joiners, RTL overrides) cause file system confusion where two processes think they're locking different files but are actually locking the same file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), can 'Lock.lock' and 'lock.lock' be treated as the same file, causing unexpected lock sharing between different cache operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: drop()] [Filesystem Type] Does drop() behavior differ on different filesystem types (ext4, btrfs, NTFS, APFS), and can those differences cause lock files to not be removed properly on some systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [fs2 Library] Does the fs2 crate's FileExt::lock_exclusive() have known vulnerabilities or platform-specific bugs that could compromise lock semantics, and is the dependency version pinned securely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Function: lock_with_alert_on_wait()] [Tokio Version] Are there known issues with the specific tokio version used regarding task::spawn_blocking or select! that could cause lock acquisition to deadlock or behave incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Struct: FileLock] [Lock Scope] If FileLock is stored in a static variable or leaked intentionally, can it cause locks to be held for the entire program lifetime, preventing other processes from ever accessing cached resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Struct: FileLock] [Early Drop] If FileLock is dropped earlier than expected (e.g., due to early return in calling code), can it cause operations that assumed exclusive access to race with other processes that acquire the released lock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/file_lock.rs] [Struct: FileLock] [Async Lifetime] In async contexts, if FileLock is not properly held across await points, can the lock be released prematurely while async operations are still in progress, violating exclusivity guarantees? (High)"
