  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Peer Start Race Condition] When executor.spawn(peer.start()) is called immediately after Peer creation, can the peer begin processing messages before all initialization is complete, causing use-after-free or uninitialized memory access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Async Block Cleanup] In the async block waiting for connection_notifs_rx.collect(), if the Peer panics or aborts, are all allocated resources properly cleaned up or can this cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [EOF Handling Vulnerability] The comment mentions waiting for EOF when all data is read (lines 115-117). Can fuzzer data that doesn't end with proper EOF markers cause the Peer to hang indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Deserialization Error Handling] If the Peer fails to deserialize a message, does it properly disconnect and clean up, or can repeated deserialization errors cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Disconnect Request Handling] When a disconnect request is read (line 117), is the disconnection handled atomically, or can race conditions cause partial cleanup that leaves the Peer in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Channel Drop Ordering] When peer_reqs_tx is dropped before waiting for network notifs to drain, can in-flight messages be lost or corrupted, potentially masking security bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Shutdown Race Condition] Can the Peer actor receive new messages between dropping peer_reqs_tx and the final cleanup, causing it to attempt operations on closed channels and panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Notification Drain Timeout] Does connection_notifs_rx.collect() have an implicit timeout, or can a malicious Peer that never fully disconnects cause the fuzzer to hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Runtime Shutdown Leak] When the tokio runtime is dropped at function exit, are all spawned tasks properly cancelled, or does the tokio leak mentioned in the comment (lines 58-62) still occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Executor Handle Leak] Does cloning the executor handle (executor.clone()) for the Peer prevent proper runtime shutdown, keeping the runtime alive beyond the fuzzing iteration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz(), generate_corpus()] [Corpus Replay Attack] Can an attacker generate a corpus using generate_corpus() and then replay it through fuzz() to trigger deterministic exploits that wouldn't be found by random fuzzing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [BCS Deserialization Panic] When MultiplexMessageStream attempts bcs::from_bytes() on fuzzer data, can crafted bytes cause panics in the BCS deserializer that crash the fuzzer before security bugs are found? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Length-Prefix Integer Overflow] Does the 4-byte length prefix in the length-delimited codec properly validate that frame lengths don't overflow when converted from u32 to usize on 32-bit systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [NetworkMessage Enum Exploitation] Can fuzzer data craft invalid enum discriminants for MultiplexMessage variants (DirectSend, RpcRequest, RpcResponse) that bypass Rust's enum safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Protocol ID Injection] With ProtocolIdSet::all_known() enabled, can fuzzer data inject messages claiming to be from critical protocols (consensus, mempool) to bypass authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [DirectSend Message Flood] Can fuzzer data generate sequences of DirectSend messages that flood upstream handlers, causing channel backpressure that blocks other critical protocol messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [RPC Request ID Collision] Can fuzzer-generated RPC requests reuse request IDs to cause collisions in the Peer's RPC tracking map, leading to responses being delivered to wrong requesters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [RPC Response Spoofing] Can fuzzer data send RPC responses without corresponding requests, potentially causing the Peer to process unsolicited data or leak information about internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Priority Inversion Attack] If MultiplexMessage supports message priorities, can fuzzer data create low-priority message floods that starve high-priority consensus or state sync messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Message Fragmentation Attack] Can fuzzer data split large messages across multiple frames in ways that cause the Peer to buffer excessive amounts of partial messages, exhausting memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Out-of-Order Message Handling] Does the Peer properly handle out-of-order message arrival, or can fuzzer data cause messages to be processed in unexpected sequences that violate protocol assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Partial Message Attack] Can fuzzer data that terminates mid-message cause the length-delimited codec to keep partial frames in memory indefinitely, leaking resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Mock Time Manipulation] Does TimeService::mock() allow fuzzer-controlled time advancement, and can this be exploited to bypass timeout-based security checks or trigger premature RPC timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Timeout Starvation] Can fuzzer data create scenarios where all 100 MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS are waiting on timeouts, preventing new legitimate RPCs from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [RPC Timeout Race] Between RPC request arrival and the INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS expiry, can race conditions cause responses to be sent after timeout, leading to resource leaks or double-responses? (Medium)"
