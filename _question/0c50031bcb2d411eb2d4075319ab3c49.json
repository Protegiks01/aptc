  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Function: set_data_dir()] [OnDiskStorage validation] Does set_data_dir() validate that the OnDiskStorage backend has proper access controls preventing other users from reading validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Field: logger] [Log injection] Can malicious configuration values be injected through logger config (line 28) causing log poisoning attacks that hide consensus violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Field: logger] [Sensitive data logging] Does LoggerConfig accidentally log sensitive safety rules data like consensus keys, votes, or internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Field: logger] [Log file permissions] Can LoggerConfig write to world-readable log files exposing safety rules internal state to unauthorized processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Type: WaypointConfig] [Waypoint validation] Does WaypointConfig validate that waypoints correspond to actual committed ledger states, or can arbitrary waypoints be injected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Waypoint freshness] Does waypoint() check that the waypoint is recent and not from an old epoch that could allow fork attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Type: WaypointConfig] [Multiple waypoint sources] Can different parts of the config specify conflicting waypoints causing validators to operate on different chain views? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/safety_rules_config.rs] [Function: consensus_key()] [Key storage] When consensus_key is set (line 259), is the private key immediately zeroized from memory after copying to prevent key recovery from memory dumps? (High)",
