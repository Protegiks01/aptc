  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Error handling] Does optimize() properly handle Result<bool, Error> failures, or can errors during optimization cause the node to start with invalid admin service configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration] [Panic safety] Can any of the config parsing, validation, or application logic panic due to invalid values, causing validator crashes during startup or reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Insecure defaults] Does the default() function at lines 41-50 create an insecure configuration with enabled: None and empty authentication_configs that could be exploited if optimize() is not called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Bind address] Why does default() bind to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) instead of 127.0.0.1 (localhost only), creating potential remote exposure even when authentication is configured? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Port conflict] Can the default port 9102 at line 46 conflict with other common services, causing silent failures where operators think admin service is running but it's not? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Credential exposure] When AdminServiceConfig is serialized (line 15), does it include the PasscodeSha256 hashes in the output, potentially exposing them in logs, backups, or exported configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Config leakage] Can serialized AdminServiceConfig leak information about whether a node is on mainnet/testnet through the enabled field, aiding network mapping attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Node type ignored] Why does sanitize() accept _node_type parameter at line 62 but never use it - should different node types (validator, full node, VFN) have different admin service security requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Node type ignored] Similarly, why does optimize() ignore _node_type at line 88 - should validators have stricter admin service restrictions than full nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Local config ignored] Why is _local_config_yaml parameter at line 87 unused - could this allow attackers to bypass config restrictions by providing conflicting local configs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Overall] [Config file tampering] If an attacker gains write access to the node's config file, can they enable unauthenticated admin service and then use privileged endpoints to extract consensus keys or manipulate validator state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Overall] [Environment variable injection] Can attackers inject environment variables that override config values during deserialization, bypassing sanitize() and optimize() checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Overall] [Config reload] If configs are hot-reloaded during runtime, does the admin service re-run sanitize() and optimize(), or can attackers change configs to malicious values without validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /malloc/stats] [Resource exhaustion] Can authenticated attackers repeatedly call /malloc/stats with maximum malloc_stats_max_len to cause memory pressure affecting consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /malloc/dump_profile] [Disk exhaustion] Does /malloc/dump_profile endpoint respect malloc_stats_max_len limits, or can it write unbounded data to disk causing storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /debug/consensus/consensusdb] [State extraction] Can authenticated attackers use /debug/consensus/consensusdb to extract complete consensus state including pending blocks, potentially enabling consensus manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /debug/consensus/quorumstoredb] [Transaction visibility] Does /debug/consensus/quorumstoredb expose mempool transactions before they're committed, enabling front-running or censorship attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /profilez] [Timing oracle] Can CPU profiling data from /profilez reveal validator voting patterns or proposal timing, enabling sophisticated consensus attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration: /threadz] [Thread enumeration] Does /threadz thread dump reveal sensitive thread names, execution state, or cryptographic material in stack traces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [TODO comment] The TODO at line 38 mentions adding SSL support - does the lack of TLS allow man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept passcodes even with SHA256 hashing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [Query parameter auth] Is authentication via query parameter (?passcode=abc) vulnerable to HTTP referer leakage if admin pages link to external resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [Session management] Does PasscodeSha256 authentication create sessions, or must every request include the passcode, increasing exposure window for credential theft? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [Port overflow] Can port value at line 20 be set to u16::MAX (65535), and does this cause issues with port binding or TCP stack implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [Reserved ports] Does port validation prevent use of port 0 (auto-assign) which might bypass firewall rules expecting a specific port? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: malloc_stats_max_len] [Zero length] Can malloc_stats_max_len be set to 0, causing division by zero or empty response issues in the malloc stats endpoint? (Low)"
