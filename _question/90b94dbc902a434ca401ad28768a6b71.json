  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Native function table manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the ordering of native function registration to cause a module registered later to overwrite critical natives registered earlier (e.g., if 'create_signer' is registered twice with different implementations), potentially bypassing authentication and enabling unauthorized signer creation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Module name collision] Does the native function table construction prevent duplicate module names, or can an attacker exploit the fact that 'create_signer' appears in both line 58 and 'genesis' module (line 61) to cause ambiguous function resolution and bypass security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Framework address bypass] Can the framework_addr parameter be manipulated during initialization to register native functions under a non-framework address, allowing malicious contracts to impersonate system modules and access privileged native functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Native table poisoning] If make_table_from_iter() at line 116 doesn't validate uniqueness, can an attacker cause the same module::function combination to be registered multiple times with different implementations, leading to non-deterministic execution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Memory exhaustion] Can the natives vector at line 47 grow unboundedly if malicious code repeatedly calls all_natives() or if the macro at lines 49-55 is exploited to register excessive duplicate entries, causing validator memory exhaustion and network liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Governance bypass] If inject_create_signer_for_gov_sim is set to true in production (line 106), can an attacker call aptos_governance::create_signer to create arbitrary signers for any address, completely bypassing governance access controls and enabling unlimited fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Configuration tampering] Can the inject_create_signer_for_gov_sim boolean be modified after genesis through a malicious configuration update or validator coordination, enabling governance simulation mode in production and allowing unauthorized signer creation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Function shadowing] When inject_create_signer_for_gov_sim is true (lines 106-114), does the aptos_governance::create_signer native shadow or conflict with other create_signer registrations, potentially causing inconsistent behavior across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type confusion] The governance simulation injects native_create_signer (line 111) which returns Value::master_signer - can this be exploited to create master signers for system addresses (0x1, 0x2, etc.) and bypass all access controls in framework modules? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Multi-signature bypass] Does the multi_ed25519 module registration (line 62) properly validate that multi-signature natives enforce threshold requirements, or can crafted inputs cause threshold bypasses enabling single-key control of multi-sig accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [BLS signature forgery] Can the bls12381 module natives (line 63) be exploited through malformed aggregate signatures or pairing operations to forge validator signatures and commit unauthorized blocks? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Bulletproof verification bypass] Can the ristretto255_bulletproofs module (lines 74-77) natives be exploited to accept invalid range proofs, enabling inflation attacks or negative balance exploits in confidential transaction systems?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Aggregator overflow] Does the aggregator module registration (line 85) properly enforce overflow checks in native aggregator operations, or can integer overflow in aggregators cause supply inflation in coin modules?
