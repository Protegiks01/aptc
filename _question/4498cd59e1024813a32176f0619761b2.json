(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: common_load_base_legacy line 15] [Integer Overflow] If common_load_base_legacy is set to MAX_U64 (e.g., via malicious governance proposal), can multiplication with NumArgs in gas.rs line 73 cause integer overflow leading to undercharged gas and consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: common_load_base_new line 16] [Version Transition Attack] During migration from gas feature version 6 to 7, can validators running different versions calculate different gas costs for the same table operation due to the switch from common_load_base_legacy to common_load_base_new, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: common_load_per_byte line 17] [DoS via Undercharging] If common_load_per_byte is set to 1 (minimal value), can an attacker create tables with extremely large serialized keys (megabytes) that cost negligible gas but consume massive validator memory during borrow_box operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: common_load_per_byte line 17] [Integer Overflow] When multiplying common_load_per_byte by NumBytes in charge_load_cost (table-natives lib.rs line 341), can an attacker provide a table value of 2^53 bytes causing overflow in InternalGas calculation and gas undercharging? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: common_load_failure line 18] [Gas Inconsistency] Why is common_load_failure set to 0 when failed table loads still consume validator resources (DB queries, deserialization attempts)? Can attackers spam failed lookups at zero cost to degrade validator performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: new_table_handle_base line 20] [State Bloat Attack] With new_table_handle_base at only 3676 gas units, can an attacker create millions of empty tables in a single transaction (if transaction gas limit allows) causing unbounded state growth and storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: new_table_handle_base line 20] [Handle Collision] Does the SHA3-256 hashing in native_new_table_handle provide sufficient entropy when combined with low gas cost, or can an attacker cheaply create tables until they find handle collisions that overwrite existing table metadata? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: add_box_base line 22] [Economic Griefing] If add_box_base is set too high via governance manipulation (e.g., 10^15), can it make all table insertions prohibitively expensive, effectively freezing all Move contracts that use tables and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: add_box_per_byte_serialized line 23] [Serialization Bomb] Can an attacker craft Move values that serialize to unexpectedly large sizes, then use the low add_box_per_byte_serialized cost (36 units) to store gigabytes of data cheaply, exhausting validator disk space? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: add_box_per_byte_serialized line 23] [Type Confusion] Is there validation that add_box_per_byte_serialized (InternalGasPerByte) is compatible with the byte count multiplication in native_add_box, or can type mismatches cause incorrect gas calculations across Rust/Move boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: borrow_box_base line 25] [Memory Exhaustion] With borrow_box_base at 4411, can an attacker repeatedly borrow large table values causing the reference counting in GlobalValue to overflow or leak memory when validators don't properly release borrows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: borrow_box_per_byte_serialized line 26] [Gas Inconsistency] Why do borrow_box and add_box have identical per_byte_serialized costs (36 units) when borrowing requires additional reference management overhead? Can this undercharging enable memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: contains_box_base line 28] [Storage Probing Attack] Since contains_box_base is only 4411 gas, can an attacker cheaply probe for the existence of arbitrary table entries across all contracts to extract private information about application state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: contains_box_per_byte_serialized line 29] [Optimization Bypass] If contains_box doesn't need to deserialize values, why charge per_byte_serialized costs? Can attackers exploit this overcharging to force transactions to fail by inflating key sizes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: remove_box_base line 31] [Double-Spending via Undercharging] If remove_box_base is too low, can an attacker repeatedly remove and re-add table entries in a loop within a single transaction, causing excessive state changes that aren't properly charged? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: remove_box_per_byte_serialized line 32] [State Deletion Griefing] Can an attacker store large values in tables then repeatedly remove them, where the low per_byte cost (36 units) doesn't cover the actual IO cost of marking entries as deleted in AptosDB? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: drop_unchecked_box_base line 36] [Memory Leak] Why is drop_unchecked_box_base only 367 gas when it doesn't verify table emptiness? Can this enable resource leaks where non-empty tables are dropped, leaving orphaned data in storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Parameter: drop_unchecked_box_base line 36] [Safety Violation] Does the extremely low drop_unchecked_box_base cost incentivize unsafe patterns where developers skip proper table cleanup to save gas, leading to permanent state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Macro: define_gas_parameters line 9] [Code Generation Attack] Can the define_gas_parameters! macro be exploited via malformed input to generate unsafe Rust code, particularly in the paste::paste! hygiene handling that could lead to identifier collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Macro: define_gas_parameters line 9] [Type Safety] Does the macro properly validate that all InternalGas parameters are actually gas costs and not other numeric types, preventing type confusion that could bypass gas checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/table.rs] [Struct: TableGasParameters line 10] [Serialization Attack] When TableGasParameters is serialized for on-chain storage via ToOnChainGasSchedule, can attackers inject malicious values that deserialize differently on validators with different Rust compiler versions? (Critical)",
