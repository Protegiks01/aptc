  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious genesis_txn_file path using directory traversal sequences (../../etc/passwd) to read arbitrary system files and leak sensitive validator keys or configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symbolic link pointing to sensitive files and trick the bootstrapper into loading arbitrary file contents as genesis transaction, potentially causing state corruption or information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does the file.read_to_end(&mut buffer) operation impose any size limits, or can an attacker provide an extremely large genesis file (gigabytes) to cause memory exhaustion and crash validator nodes during bootstrapping? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [BCS Deserialization Attack] Can a maliciously crafted BCS-encoded file exploit vulnerabilities in bcs::from_bytes() to cause panic, infinite loops, or memory corruption during deserialization of nested structures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Type Confusion] After BCS deserialization returns a Transaction object, can an attacker craft a file that deserializes to a non-GenesisTransaction variant (UserTransaction, BlockMetadata) but passes the assertion check through type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker craft a BCS payload with extremely large length prefixes that cause integer overflow in buffer allocation during deserialization, leading to heap corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the BCS deserializer have recursion depth limits, or can deeply nested Transaction structures cause stack overflow during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Race Condition] If the genesis file is modified between the File::open() call and read_to_end() operation (TOCTOU), can an attacker swap the file contents to inject a malicious genesis transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Transaction Type Bypass] The assertion at line 45-47 only checks if the transaction matches GenesisTransaction pattern - can an attacker craft a GenesisTransaction with malicious WriteSetPayload that bypasses validation in calculate_genesis()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Empty Genesis] What happens if the genesis_txn contains an empty WriteSet - does calculate_genesis() properly reject it, or could it create a blockchain with uninitialized state allowing fund creation from nothing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Malicious State Initialization] Can the genesis transaction WriteSet initialize system accounts (0x1, 0x2) with arbitrary balances or permissions that violate economic security invariants? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Concurrent Access] The comment at line 50-51 states the DB is opened exclusively, but does AptosDB::open() actually acquire file-level locks, or can multiple bootstrap processes run concurrently causing database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Lock Bypass] If the database is already locked by a running node, does the .expect() panic at line 62 leave the database in an inconsistent state, or is there proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Directory Traversal in db_dir] Can an attacker provide a malicious db_dir path that writes genesis data to arbitrary filesystem locations through path traversal, potentially overwriting critical system files?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Indexer Disabled] The indexer parameter is set to false at line 57 - does this mean the genesis state cannot be properly queried after bootstrapping, potentially breaking API functionality? (Low)",
