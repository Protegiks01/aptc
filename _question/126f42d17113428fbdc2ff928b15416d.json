  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/observer_client.rs] [Function: serialize_message_for_peer()] [Message validation] Does ConsensusObserverDirectSend undergo any validation before serialization, or can malformed messages cause serialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/observer_client.rs] [Function: send_rpc_request_to_peer()] [Request validation] Is ConsensusObserverRequest validated before sending, or can malformed requests exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving node? (High)",
