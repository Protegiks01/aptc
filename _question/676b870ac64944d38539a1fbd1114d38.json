  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 16-29] [Test address coverage] Do the seven test addresses provide sufficient coverage for all possible validation failure modes, or are there critical error paths (e.g., module loading failures, type checking errors) that cannot be tested with this mock? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 60-76] [Determinism] Is the address-to-error mapping deterministic and consistent across all validators, or could different validators using this mock produce different validation results causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Function: TransactionValidation::validate_transaction()] [Edge case coverage] Are edge cases like transactions with zero gas price, maximum sequence numbers, or boundary timestamp values handled correctly, or does the mock hide bugs in edge case handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Struct: MockVMValidator] [Feature flags] Is there a compile-time or runtime check that prevents MockVMValidator from being used in production builds, or could a configuration error enable the mock in mainnet validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 1-85] [Build configuration] Does the module include debug_assert! or cfg!(test) guards to ensure this mock is only compiled in test builds, preventing accidental production use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 31-32] [Visibility] Should MockVMValidator be pub(crate) instead of pub to prevent external crates from accidentally depending on and using the mock validator in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Function: TransactionValidation::validate_transaction()] [Prologue bypass] Does the mock skip execution of the transaction prologue that performs critical checks like account existence, balance verification, and sequence number validation in Move code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 35-42] [Epilogue bypass] Is the transaction epilogue that handles fee deduction and event emission skipped, potentially causing incorrect fee accounting if this mock is used in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [Event emission] Does the empty notify_commit() implementation mean that transaction validation events are never emitted, breaking observability and monitoring in production systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 64-65] [Balance calculation] For INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE_TEST_ADD, does the mock check that the account balance is actually insufficient for max_gas_amount * gas_unit_price, or is the error returned unconditionally, hiding balance calculation bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 60-61] [Account creation] For ACCOUNT_DNE_TEST_ADD, should the mock verify that creating the account during transaction execution would succeed, or does unconditionally returning SENDING_ACCOUNT_DOES_NOT_EXIST hide account creation bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 72-73] [Auth key rotation] For INVALID_AUTH_KEY_TEST_ADD, does the mock validate that the authentication key matches the sender's current auth key, or is this check skipped for all other addresses, enabling key rotation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Function: TransactionValidation::validate_transaction()] [Consensus divergence] If different validators use different versions of this mock with inconsistent validation logic, could they accept different transaction sets into their mempools, causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Lines: 48-78] [Byzantine behavior] Can a malicious validator modify their copy of MockVMValidator to accept invalid transactions while honest validators reject them, creating opportunities for double-spending or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/vm-validator/src/mocks/mock_vm_validator.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [State synchronization] Does the lack of state updates in notify_commit() cause validators to diverge in their validation decisions after multiple blocks, breaking consensus liveness? (High)"
