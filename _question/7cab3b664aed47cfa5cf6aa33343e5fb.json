  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_network::application::error::Error>] [Error source attribution] Does converting network errors lose information about which peer caused the error, making it impossible to implement per-peer rate limiting or banning policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_network::application::error::Error>] [Type confusion attacks] Could attackers send malformed network messages that trigger specific error types, which then get misclassified through this conversion, bypassing security policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_network::application::error::Error>] [Error injection via network] Can malicious peers craft network messages that, when they fail to parse, inject arbitrary strings into UnexpectedErrorEncountered error messages, potentially corrupting logs or triggering log injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Log injection] Can attackers inject newlines, ANSI escape codes, or other control characters into error message strings, breaking log parsing, corrupting log files, or injecting fake log entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Path traversal in errors] If file paths or resource identifiers are included in error messages, could attackers craft requests that expose internal directory structures or file system organization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Timing attack via errors] Do different error variants or error message lengths reveal timing information about internal processing, storage access patterns, or validation logic that could be exploited? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Format string vulnerabilities] If error messages are ever used in format strings or template systems, could attackers inject format specifiers causing crashes, information disclosure, or code execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Error message size] Are there any limits on error message string lengths, or could attackers trigger errors with unbounded message sizes causing memory exhaustion or transmission overhead? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [Cryptographic material in errors] Could stack traces or debug information in error messages accidentally expose cryptographic keys, seeds, or other secret material? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error messages] [SQL injection markers] If storage errors include database error messages, could they reveal SQL query structures or injection points useful for planning database attacks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error handling] [Error-based DoS] Can malicious peers repeatedly trigger specific error conditions to consume CPU, memory, or I/O resources faster than they can be reclaimed, causing gradual service degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error handling] [Error recovery exploits] If error handling includes retry logic or recovery mechanisms, can attackers exploit these to keep the system in a degraded state or bypass rate limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error handling] [Error propagation race] Are there race conditions between error generation, error logging, and error handling that could lead to lost error events or inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error handling] [Cascading failures] Can a single peer triggering many errors cause cascading failures in the peer monitoring service that affect other components like consensus or state sync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Error handling] [Error-based peer scoring] Is error information used for peer reputation or scoring, and can attackers game this system by triggering specific error types to manipulate peer rankings? (Medium)",
