(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/schema.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Visibility bypass] Does the macro correctly enforce pub(crate) visibility on line 72, or can an attacker define schemas with public visibility through macro parameter manipulation to expose internal database structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/schema.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the macro to create schemas where Key and Value types are swapped or mismatched, causing state corruption when data is written with one schema and read with another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/schema.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Namespace pollution] Does the macro expansion on lines 69-81 properly scope generated types, or can schema definitions conflict causing one schema to overwrite another's implementation leading to data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/schema.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Column family collision] Is there runtime validation that COLUMN_FAMILY_NAME values are unique across all schemas, or can duplicate column family names cause data from different schemas to be stored in the same column family leading to state corruption?
