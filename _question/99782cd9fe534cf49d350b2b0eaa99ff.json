  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Emergency downgrade] If a critical vulnerability is found in a stable version, can the network emergency-downgrade, or would existing bytecode become unexecutable? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Feature flag coordination] Are language feature gates (like lang_feature_versions) coordinated through on-chain governance, or could offline coordination failures cause divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Deterministic parsing] Is version parsing guaranteed to be deterministic across all platforms and Rust compiler versions? Could platform differences cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Hash stability] If CompilationMetadata is included in transaction or state hashes, could serialization non-determinism cause hash mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Signature verification] If version metadata is part of signed data, does signature verification happen before or after version parsing? Could parsing errors bypass signature checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: LanguageVersion::infer_bytecode_version()] [VM version mismatch] If inferred bytecode version doesn't match VM expectations, could bytecode be misinterpreted, causing incorrect execution or crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Gas metering] Do different language versions have different gas costs? Could version metadata manipulation be used to bypass gas limits or cause unfair gas charging? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Type system bypass] Could deploying bytecode compiled with a newer language version on a validator expecting an older version bypass type system restrictions? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Resource safety] Could language version mismatches allow Move resource safety invariants to be violated, enabling double-spending or resource duplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: CompilerVersion::check_language_support()] [Incomplete validation] Does check_language_support() verify actual compiler capabilities, or only check version numbers? Could this allow compilation with unsupported features? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Version compatibility matrix] Is there a comprehensive compatibility matrix tested between all CompilerVersion and LanguageVersion combinations? Could untested combinations cause failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Comment: Line 18] [Version rollout] The comment mentions V2_2 produces warnings - could deploying V2_2 as stable without fixing warnings cause unexpected behavior in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Version documentation] Are version differences and breaking changes clearly documented? Could developers unknowingly use incompatible version combinations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Const initialization] Are all const values initialized atomically at program start? Could initialization order issues cause race conditions in multi-threaded validators? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Clone implementation] Is CompilationMetadata::clone() safe for concurrent access? Could cloning during serialization cause corrupted copies? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Dependency versions] Are the imported VERSION_DEFAULT constants from move_binary_format version-pinned? Could dependency updates silently change version behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Third-party code] Is the legacy_move_compiler dependency trusted? Could malicious updates to CompilerLanguageVersion affect version selection? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: LanguageVersion::infer_bytecode_version()] [Env variable priority] Should environment variable override always take precedence over version-based selection? Could this override mechanism be abused in production? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Version string length] Is there a maximum length enforced on version strings? Could extremely long strings cause buffer overflows or DoS during parsing? (Low)",
