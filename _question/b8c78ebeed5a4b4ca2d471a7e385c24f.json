  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Field: microseconds] [Unit confusion] Could code incorrectly interpret microseconds as milliseconds or seconds, causing 1000x or 1000000x time errors that break consensus timeout mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Field: microseconds] [Precision loss] When timestamps are read and written multiple times, could floating-point conversions or rounding introduce drift that accumulates over time causing validators to disagree? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Time manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator propose a block with a CurrentTimeMicroseconds value billions of years in the future, causing honest validators to reject all subsequent legitimate blocks as having timestamps 'in the past'? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Timestamp regression] Could an attacker exploit race conditions in timestamp updates to make the global time move backwards, violating monotonicity and causing double-spending through transaction replay? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [NIL block exploitation] Can an attacker craft NIL blocks with manipulated CurrentTimeMicroseconds values that equal the previous timestamp but have different internal representations, bypassing equality checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Epoch boundary attack] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, could timestamp validation be bypassed allowing the new validator set to reset time to an earlier value? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Quorum certificate bypass] Could an attacker get f+1 validators to sign blocks with invalid CurrentTimeMicroseconds values that bypass the Move module's validation but still achieve quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [State corruption] If AptosDB corrupts the stored CurrentTimeMicroseconds value, could validators read inconsistent timestamps causing consensus to split between validators with correct vs corrupted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Merkle proof forgery] Could an attacker forge Merkle proofs for the CurrentTimeMicroseconds resource to make light clients accept blocks with manipulated timestamps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Snapshot inconsistency] When validators restore from state snapshots, could stale CurrentTimeMicroseconds values be loaded that are older than the actual blockchain time, causing validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Write-ahead log] If timestamp updates are written to WAL before being committed to storage, could crashes leave timestamps in inconsistent states between validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Pruning vulnerability] Does state pruning properly preserve CurrentTimeMicroseconds history, or could pruned timestamps cause historical block validation to fail during state sync? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Prologue bypass] Could malicious transactions bypass block prologue timestamp updates by directly modifying CurrentTimeMicroseconds through unsafe Rust code or VM bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Gas metering exploit] When reading CurrentTimeMicroseconds from storage, could incorrect gas metering allow DoS attacks that repeatedly fetch timestamps to exhaust validator resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Parallel execution race] During Block-STM parallel execution, could concurrent reads of CurrentTimeMicroseconds see different values leading to non-deterministic execution and state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Resource safety violation] Could Move's resource safety be violated if CurrentTimeMicroseconds is copied instead of moved, allowing multiple mutable references that cause timestamp corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Type parameter confusion] If CurrentTimeMicroseconds is used with generic type parameters, could type substitution attacks allow it to be treated as a different resource bypassing access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [REST API manipulation] Could the REST API's exposure of CurrentTimeMicroseconds allow timing attacks that reveal internal validator clock skew, enabling targeted consensus attacks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Indexer inconsistency] Could indexer services cache stale CurrentTimeMicroseconds values that diverge from on-chain state, causing dApps to make decisions based on incorrect time? (Medium)",
