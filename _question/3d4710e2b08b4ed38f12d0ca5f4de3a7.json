  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/transaction_argument.rs] [Enum: TransactionArgument] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft a transaction with mismatched TransactionArgument types (e.g., passing U256 as U8) to bypass type checking in the Move VM, potentially causing integer truncation that leads to fund loss or unauthorized access?
