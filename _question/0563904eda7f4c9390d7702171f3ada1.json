  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with excessively large String fields (old_uri or new_uri) to cause memory exhaustion during deserialization, leading to validator node crashes and consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can malicious bytes be crafted to deserialize into a CollectionUriMutate with mismatched type tags, bypassing type safety checks and causing state corruption when processed by indexers or event translators?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] During BCS deserialization of String length prefixes for collection_name, old_uri, or new_uri fields, can integer overflow in length calculations cause buffer overflows or memory corruption?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutate] [Unicode normalization] Can Unicode homograph attacks in collection_name allow attackers to create visually identical but cryptographically distinct collection names, enabling phishing or name squatting?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Function: creator_addr()] [Zero address bypass] Does creator_addr accept the zero address (0x0), potentially allowing invalid or system-level events that break indexer assumptions about valid creator accounts?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutate] [Event replay] Can CollectionUriMutate events be replayed across different transactions or blocks to create duplicate URI mutation records in indexers, causing state confusion? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutate] [URI mismatch] Can old_uri and new_uri be identical, creating no-op mutation events that waste storage and confuse indexers about actual state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutate] [Collection existence] Does event emission validate that the collection actually exists on-chain, or can phantom URI mutation events be created for non-existent collections? (High)",
