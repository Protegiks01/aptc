  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker specify u64::MAX as the amount parameter to cause integer overflow in on-chain stake calculations, potentially minting unlimited stake or corrupting validator state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Pool Type Confusion] Does the function properly validate stake_pool.pool_type before calling different aptos_stdlib functions, or can a malicious API response cause the CLI to send incorrect transactions for Direct pools thinking they are StakingContract pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the get_stake_pools() response to add stake to pools they don't own by returning fake pool data with their target victim's operator_address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Race Condition] When iterating through multiple stake_pool_results, can a malicious validator intercept and reorder transactions to cause partial execution where some pools receive stake while others fail, leading to inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Amount Validation] Does the function validate that self.amount is non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can an attacker add zero stake to waste gas or add excessive amounts to trigger on-chain overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Vesting Contract Bypass] The function returns an error for Vesting pool types, but can an attacker craft a malicious stake pool response that misrepresents a Vesting contract as Direct or StakingContract to bypass this check and add stake improperly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Transaction Ordering] When multiple pools are processed, are transactions submitted sequentially or concurrently, and can this be exploited to cause double-spending if the same coins are used for multiple stake additions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Operator Address Validation] For StakingContract pools, does the function validate that stake_pool.operator_address is a valid and expected address, or can a compromised API return malicious operator addresses to redirect stake? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Error Handling] If submit_transaction() fails for one pool in the loop, does the function rollback previous successful transactions or leave the stake in an inconsistent state across multiple pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: AddStake::execute()] [Balance Check] Does the function verify the owner has sufficient balance before attempting to add stake, or can it submit transactions that will fail on-chain, wasting gas and potentially locking user funds in failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Lockup Period Bypass] Can an attacker unlock stake before the lockup period expires by manipulating the amount parameter or exploiting race conditions between lockup checks and unlock execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Amount Manipulation] Can an attacker specify an unlock amount larger than their staked balance to trigger on-chain arithmetic errors that could corrupt stake pool accounting or unlock more than they should? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Pool Type Exploit] Similar to AddStake, can pool type confusion cause incorrect unlock transactions to be sent, potentially unlocking funds from wrong contracts or bypassing access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Vesting Contract Bypass] The function blocks Vesting contracts with an error, but can a malicious node return incorrect pool_type data to allow unlocking vesting stakes prematurely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Operator Address Injection] For StakingContract unlocks, can an attacker provide a malicious stake_pool.operator_address that differs from the legitimate operator to unlock stake from unintended contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Partial Unlock Attack] When processing multiple pools, if some unlock transactions succeed and others fail, does this create an exploitable state where an attacker can repeatedly attempt unlocks to eventually drain all pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Zero Amount] Can an attacker call unlock with amount=0 to trigger state transitions or bypass checks without actually unlocking stake, potentially griefing the system or manipulating validator sets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Concurrent Unlocks] If multiple unlock transactions are submitted concurrently for the same pool, can race conditions cause double-unlocking or state corruption in the stake pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [Transaction Replay] After unlocking, can the same transaction be replayed to unlock the same stake multiple times if sequence number validation is bypassed or manipulated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockStake::execute()] [API Spoofing] Can a malicious API endpoint return fake stake pool data to trick users into unlocking stake from pools they don't control, effectively transferring unlock rights? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Premature Withdrawal] Can an attacker withdraw stake before the unlock period expires by manipulating timestamps or exploiting gaps between unlock and withdrawal checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Amount Bypass for StakingContract] The code comments note that amount only applies to Direct pools while StakingContract distributes all coins - can this inconsistency be exploited to withdraw more than intended from StakingContract pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Recipient Manipulation] Does the withdrawal function properly verify the recipient address, or can an attacker modify the transaction to redirect withdrawn funds to their own address instead of the owner? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Pool Type Switch Attack] Can an attacker exploit the different withdrawal logic for Direct vs StakingContract pools to withdraw from one pool type using the parameters intended for another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Vesting Contract Redirect] The function blocks Vesting withdrawals with an error, but can an attacker use distribute-vested-coins logic to bypass normal withdrawal restrictions and extract funds prematurely? (High)"
