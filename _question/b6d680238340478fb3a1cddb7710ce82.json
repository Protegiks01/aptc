(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/parser/filter.rs] [Function: filter_module_member()] [Member filtering order dependency] Does the order in which module members are filtered matter, and can attackers exploit ordering dependencies by placing malicious members in specific positions?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/parser/filter.rs] [Overall: Determinism] [Non-deterministic filtering] Are all filtering operations deterministic across different nodes/validators, or can non-determinism cause different nodes to compile different code versions, breaking consensus?
