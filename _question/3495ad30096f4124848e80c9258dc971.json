  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [VRF Manipulation] Can panics during VRF-based randomness generation cause validators to skip randomness contributions, enabling validators to influence leader election by strategically crashing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Nonce Corruption] Can process exits during nonce/sequence number updates cause validators to restart with incorrect nonce values, leading to transaction replay vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Reward Calculation Bypass] Can strategic panics during reward distribution calculations allow validators to avoid penalties or claim unearned rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Slashing Evasion] If a validator is about to be slashed for misbehavior, can triggering a panic and process exit prevent the slashing transaction from being executed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Governance Vote Manipulation] Can panics during governance proposal execution prevent votes from being counted or executed, allowing attackers to block legitimate proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Stake Lock Bypass] Can process exits during staking operations leave validators' stake in an inconsistent state where it's simultaneously locked and unlocked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Line: 5] [Unsafe Code Ban] The file has #![forbid(unsafe_code)] - but are there any transitive dependencies used by this module (backtrace, TOML serialization) that contain unsafe code blocks with potential memory safety issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Panic Unwinding] The TODO comment mentions 'can_unwind' stabilization - without checking if unwinding is safe, can non-unwindable panics cause undefined behavior in the crash handler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [String Formatting] Does the format!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Backtrace Cost] Is Backtrace::new() expensive enough that an attacker could trigger many panics in quick succession to cause CPU exhaustion before the process exits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Panic in Drop] What happens if a panic occurs inside a Drop implementation during panic unwinding - can this cause a double-panic that aborts the process without proper logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [FFI Boundary] If panics occur at FFI boundaries with C/C++ code (like in cryptographic libraries), does the panic handler properly handle this or can it cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Signal Handlers] Can UNIX signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL) race with panic handling, causing the process to exit with different exit codes and preventing crash information from being logged? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Out of Memory] If the system is out of memory, can the backtrace generation or TOML serialization fail to allocate, causing a nested panic that aborts without logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Stack Overflow] Can stack overflow panics be handled properly by this handler, or does the limited stack space prevent backtrace generation and logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Docker/Kubernetes] In containerized deployments, does the exit code 12 properly signal to orchestration systems that this is a crash requiring investigation vs. a normal shutdown? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Graceful Shutdown] Can the immediate process::exit(12) bypass graceful shutdown hooks that are necessary for cluster coordination, causing cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Health Checks] If health check endpoints panic, can the process exit before the health check system marks the validator as unhealthy, causing traffic to be routed to a crashed node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Backup Interruption] Can panics during backup operations cause process exits that corrupt backup data, preventing recovery from disasters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Upgrade Rollback] If a panic occurs during a protocol upgrade, can the process exit prevent proper rollback, leaving the validator in an incompatible state? (High)"
