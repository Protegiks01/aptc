  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Filter Complexity DoS] Can attackers craft transactions that match complex filter rules requiring expensive computation (e.g., checking all MultiKey authenticator keys against PublicKey matchers), causing CPU exhaustion during filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 36-43] [Repeated is_enabled() Calls] If is_enabled() is called repeatedly for each transaction, can the is_empty() check on large filter rule sets cause performance degradation, especially under high transaction load? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Memory Amplification] Can attackers submit configuration files with highly redundant filter rules that consume excessive memory when deserialized into TransactionFiltersConfig, causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Cascading Filter Failures] If one filter component (e.g., mempool_filter) fails or panics during transaction evaluation, can this cascade to other filters, causing widespread filtering failures and allowing malicious transactions through? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 46-52] [Default Construction Cost] Is the default() implementation cheap to call repeatedly, or could frequent default config instantiation during testing or error recovery cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 59] [BatchDigest Collision] When BatchTransactionFilter uses BatchDigest matching, are hash collisions considered, or could attackers generate batches with colliding digests to bypass digest-based filter rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [BlockId Collision] When BlockTransactionFilter uses BlockId matching, can hash collisions in block IDs allow malicious blocks to masquerade as trusted blocks, bypassing author or ID-based filters? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [TransactionId Matching] Can TransactionId matcher in TransactionFilter be exploited through hash collision attacks, allowing malicious transactions to impersonate specifically filtered transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Cryptographic Downgrade] Can configuration attacks force nodes to use weaker or no filtering by manipulating serde deserialization to ignore strongly-configured filters? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [PublicKey Matching] When TransactionFilter uses PublicKey matching, are all key types (Ed25519, Secp256k1, Secp256r1, Keyless, FederatedKeyless) handled consistently, or can attackers use alternative key types to bypass PublicKey filters? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [BlockEpoch Matchers] When BlockTransactionFilter uses BlockEpochGreaterThan or BlockEpochLessThan matchers, can integer overflow in epoch comparisons cause filters to behave incorrectly at high epoch numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [BlockTimestamp Matchers] Can clock skew between validators cause BlockTimeStampGreaterThan and BlockTimeStampLessThan filters to produce inconsistent results, allowing transactions through some validators but not others? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 14-15] [Epoch Transition Filters] During epoch transitions, if consensus_filter and execution_filter have different epoch-based rules, can this cause validators to diverge on which transactions to include in epoch boundary blocks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators manipulate block timestamps to cause their blocks to bypass BlockTimeStamp filters, including transactions that should be filtered at the current time? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Time-based Filter Updates] If filter configurations are updated based on time or epoch, are updates synchronized across all filter types to prevent temporal inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Configuration Access Control] Are there any mechanisms to ensure only authorized operators can modify TransactionFiltersConfig, or can any process with config file write access inject malicious filter rules? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 23-33] [filter_enabled Field] Is the filter_enabled field protected from unauthorized modification after initialization, or can runtime attacks toggle filtering on/off to bypass security policies? (Medium)",

  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 13-17] [Per-Component Filters] Can attackers target the weakest filter component (e.g., api_filter vs consensus_filter) to find the path of least resistance for malicious transaction injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [Sender Matcher] When TransactionFilter uses Sender matcher, can multi-sender transactions (MultiAgent, FeePayer) bypass sender-based filters by using non-primary senders? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [AccountAddress Matcher] Does AccountAddress matcher check all address locations (sender, secondary signers, fee payer, multisig address, script arguments, entry function module), or can attackers hide malicious addresses in unchecked locations?
