  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: direct_send] [Access Control] Does the public exposure of the direct_send module via 'pub mod direct_send' create an unnecessarily broad API surface that could be exploited by malicious code to send unauthorized protocol messages, potentially bypassing validator authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: health_checker] [Information Disclosure] Can the public health_checker module be abused by external attackers to gather timing information about validator availability and network topology, enabling targeted DoS attacks during critical consensus moments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: identity] [Authentication Bypass] Does the public exposure of the identity protocol module allow untrusted code to directly manipulate handshake logic, potentially bypassing peer authentication and allowing Byzantine nodes to join the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: network] [Protocol Confusion] Can malicious code exploit the public network module to inject crafted protocol messages that cause protocol confusion between consensus, mempool, and state sync, leading to network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: rpc] [RPC Abuse] Does the public RPC module exposure allow untrusted components to make arbitrary RPC calls to validators, potentially exhausting resources or causing validator slowdown affecting consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: stream] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the public stream protocol module be exploited to open unlimited streams to validators, causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes that impact network liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module: wire] [Serialization Attack] Does the public wire format module allow malicious code to craft malformed wire protocol messages that bypass validation in downstream components, potentially causing state corruption or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] [Defense in Depth] Should any of these protocol modules (direct_send, health_checker, identity, network, rpc, stream, wire) be marked as 'pub(crate)' instead of 'pub' to limit external access and reduce attack surface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Architecture] [Principle of Least Privilege] Does the blanket public export of all seven protocol modules violate the principle of least privilege, allowing components that shouldn't have direct protocol access to potentially misuse these APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Security Boundary] Is there a clear security boundary definition for which external crates should have access to these protocol modules, and could tighter visibility controls prevent protocol misuse? (Low)"
