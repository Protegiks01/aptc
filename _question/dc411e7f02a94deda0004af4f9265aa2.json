  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: interner] [Memory exhaustion] Does the 'interner' module's public API allow unbounded string interning, enabling attackers to exhaust validator memory by creating millions of unique interned strings during transaction execution?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: value_serde] [Deserialization attack] Does the public 'value_serde' module properly validate deserialized Move values, or can attackers craft malicious serialized data that causes integer overflows, buffer overflows, or arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: value_traversal] [Infinite recursion] Can the 'value_traversal' module be exploited with deeply nested or circular Move values to cause stack overflow during traversal, crashing validator nodes and causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: values] [Resource safety violation] Does the public 'values' module API enforce Move's linear resource semantics, or can it be misused to duplicate resources (double-spend coins) or drop resources without proper destruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: views] [Confidentiality breach] Can the 'views' module expose internal VM state through public view functions, leaking sensitive information like private account balances, pending transactions, or validator keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Cross-module: code + instr] [Bytecode validation gap] Can inconsistencies between the 'code' and 'instr' module's bytecode representations allow attackers to construct bytecode that passes validation in one module but executes incorrectly in another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Cross-module: gas + values] [Gas calculation bypass] Can the interaction between 'gas' metering and 'values' operations be exploited to perform expensive value operations without consuming proportional gas, enabling DoS attacks? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Cross-module: natives + resolver] [Privilege escalation] Can native functions invoked through the 'natives' module bypass 'resolver' access controls to directly modify protected system state (validator set, governance parameters)?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Library: version mismatch] If different validators run different versions of move-vm-types with incompatible sha3_256() implementations or module APIs, can this cause consensus failures and network partitions? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Library: dependency vulnerabilities] Are the sha3 crate and other dependencies used by move-vm-types pinned to specific versions, or can dependency confusion attacks substitute malicious crates that compromise validator security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Library: panic safety] Do the exported modules properly handle panics, or can attacker-triggered panics in any module propagate through lib.rs and crash validator processes during consensus-critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Library: feature flags] Does lib.rs or its modules use conditional compilation (cfg flags) that change API behavior between build configurations, potentially causing consensus incompatibility between validators? (Critical)",
