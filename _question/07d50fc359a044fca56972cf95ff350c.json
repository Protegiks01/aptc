  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/mod.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Access Control] Does the command dispatcher enforce any access control checks before executing GetValue or ScanSnapshot commands, or can any user with CLI access read arbitrary state data including sensitive validator keys and account balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/mod.rs] [Enum: Cmd] [Command Injection] Can malicious command-line arguments be injected through the clap parser to execute unintended database operations or bypass intended command restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/mod.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Error Handling] If GetValue or ScanSnapshot commands return errors, does the error propagation leak sensitive database internals or file paths that could aid an attacker in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/mod.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly invoke resource-intensive commands through the dispatcher to exhaust system resources and cause denial of service on the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Input Validation] Does the address parsing from hex_literal properly validate input length and format, or can oversized/malformed address strings cause buffer overflows or panics when passed to AccountAddress::from_hex_literal()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Integer Overflow] When parsing the struct_tag string using StructTag::from_str(), can specially crafted struct tags with extremely long type parameters cause integer overflows in string parsing or memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Panic/Unwrap] The code calls .unwrap() on AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() - can invalid hex addresses cause panics that crash the debugging tool and potentially leave the database in an inconsistent state if called during critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Resource Key Construction] When constructing the StateKey using StateKey::resource(&address, &struct_tag), can malicious struct_tag combinations bypass intended access restrictions or access system-reserved state keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Database Access] Does opening ledger_db and state_kv_db perform proper permission checks, or can unauthorized users gain read access to raw database files containing sensitive validator state and private transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Version Validation] When checking if self.version > latest_version, the code only prints a warning - can an attacker query future versions (e.g., u64::MAX) to trigger undefined behavior or access uninitialized state values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Integer Underflow] In the version iteration loop, the code performs start_version = version - 1 - can this underflow when version is 0, potentially causing infinite loops or accessing invalid memory addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Unbounded Iteration] The while loop limiting count < 10 iterations - can an attacker exploit the version traversal logic to force expensive database queries over many historical versions, causing DoS through resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Information Disclosure] Does get_state_value_with_version_by_version() return deleted or tombstoned values that should be hidden, potentially leaking sensitive data from deleted accounts or revoked permissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Output Sanitization] When printing state values with println!, does it properly sanitize binary data to prevent terminal escape sequence injection or log poisoning attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Memory Exhaustion] The function prints values up to 1024 bytes but truncates larger ones - can an attacker query extremely large state values (multi-GB) to cause out-of-memory errors before the truncation check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Metadata Leakage] Does printing value.into_metadata() expose internal database metadata like creation timestamps, tombstone markers, or internal flags that could aid attacks on state consistency? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Race Condition] Between getting latest_version from metadata_db and querying state_kv_db, can concurrent writes cause inconsistent reads where the version exists in one DB but not the other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Database Lock] Does opening the database with open_ledger_db() and open_state_kv_db() acquire read locks that could block critical consensus writes, causing validator performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Stale Reads] If querying a version that's currently being pruned, can the tool return partial or corrupted state values leading to incorrect audit conclusions about state integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Transaction Isolation] Does the debug query run in a consistent snapshot, or can it observe intermediate state from partially-committed transactions violating atomicity guarantees? (High)",
