  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate_in_place()] [Deprecation Risk] If DensePolynomial is deprecated in favor of SparsePolynomial, can the migration introduce bugs where differentiation of sparse representations produces different results than dense representation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate_in_place()] [Malicious Input] Can an attacker provide a polynomial with carefully chosen coefficients that cause F::from(i as u64) * self.coeffs[i] to always equal zero, making all derivative coefficients zero and breaking Lagrange interpolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate_in_place()] [Coefficient Substitution] If an attacker can modify polynomial coefficients between the loop iterations at line 34-36, can they inject malicious values that corrupt the derivative computation and enable threshold signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate_in_place()] [Index Manipulation] While Rust prevents out-of-bounds access, can an attacker exploit unsafe code elsewhere to modify the loop variable i, causing the differentiation to skip coefficients or differentiate the same coefficient multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate()] [Clone Interception] If an attacker can provide a custom Clone implementation through trait injection, can they observe or modify polynomial coefficients during the clone() operation at line 20, leaking secret shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/differentiate.rs] [Function: differentiate_in_place()] [State Machine Confusion] If differentiation is performed on polynomials from different epochs or validator sets simultaneously, can the lack of namespacing cause derivatives from different contexts to be mixed, corrupting threshold reconstruction? (High)"
