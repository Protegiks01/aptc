  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Lost notification] Between releasing the lock in cvar.wait() and reacquiring it, if set_value() is called and notifies but the thread hasn't entered the wait state yet, can notifications be lost causing permanent blocking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [Notification ordering] Does notify_all() guarantee all waiting threads observe the Ready state before any new thread can call set_value() again, or can notification ordering lead to threads seeing stale Waiting status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Enum: RemoteValueStatus] [Invalid state] Can the RemoteValueStatus enum be constructed in an invalid state outside of the defined Ready/Waiting variants through unsafe code or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] The match on RemoteValueStatus only handles Ready and has unreachable!() for Waiting - if new enum variants are added in future, will this cause undetected panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [Type confusion] Can type confusion between Option<StateValue> with None vs Some cause incorrect state value semantics when different shards interpret missing vs empty state differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Timing side-channel] Can the duration a thread waits in get_value() leak information about cross-shard dependencies or execution patterns that can be exploited to infer private transaction data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: is_ready()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between calling is_ready() and get_value(), can the RemoteValueStatus change from Ready back to Waiting, causing time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: is_ready()] [Race condition] If is_ready() is used to avoid blocking but another thread calls get_value() between the check and use, can this lead to unexpected blocking behavior in critical execution paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep vs shallow clone] The #[derive(Clone)] on RemoteStateValue performs Arc::clone for shallow copy - can multiple clones sharing the same underlying state cause unexpected state mutations when set_value() is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone semantics attack] Can an attacker clone RemoteStateValue before get_value() and after set_value() to observe state transitions and exploit race conditions in the waiting/ready state machine? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Clone cost] The value.clone() on potentially large StateValue objects - can this clone operation consume significant CPU time, creating DoS opportunities by forcing expensive clones?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: waiting()] [Initialization] Can RemoteStateValue::waiting() be called but never have a corresponding set_value(), leaving it in permanent Waiting state and causing deadlock in dependent code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [API contract] Is there any enforcement that set_value() should be called exactly once, or can repeated calls with different values cause non-deterministic behavior in consuming code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Timeout missing] There's no timeout mechanism in get_value() - can this cause validators to hang indefinitely waiting for Byzantine shards, requiring manual intervention and breaking liveness guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: is_ready()] [Double-check pattern] If caller uses is_ready() then get_value(), the lack of atomicity between these calls can cause race conditions - should these be combined into a single atomic operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Condvar spurious wakeup] While the code handles spurious wakeups with a while loop, can excessive spurious wakeups under high contention cause performance degradation or resource exhaustion? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Wait predicate] The while loop checks RemoteValueStatus::Waiting as the wait predicate - is this check atomic and thread-safe, or can it observe torn reads of the enum discriminant? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [StateValue validation] Is there any validation of the StateValue parameter before storing it in RemoteValueStatus::Ready, or can malformed/corrupted StateValues be set causing downstream execution errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [StateValue corruption] When cloning StateValue, can memory corruption or race conditions cause the cloned value to differ from the original, breaking deterministic execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [None semantics] When set_value(None) is called, does this correctly represent 'state does not exist' vs 'state exists but is empty', and can confusion between these semantics cause execution bugs?
