  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [CommonCheckerConfig dependency] The common field is flattened into the config. Can malicious values in CommonCheckerConfig (like required=false when should be true) cause critical health checks to be silently skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [CheckResult usage] The returned CheckResult struct is consumed by callers. If callers don't properly handle the score field or multiple results, can this cause misinterpretation of node health status? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [ProviderCollection lifecycle] The providers parameter is borrowed. If the underlying providers are modified concurrently by other threads during check() execution, can this cause race conditions or inconsistent measurements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Panic on success] If latencies vector is somehow empty despite passing the error check at line 89, the division at line 108 will panic. Are there code paths where this can occur (e.g., num_samples=num_allowed_errors+1 with all failures)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Score range validity] The scores 0, 50, and 100 are hardcoded in lines 93, 113, and 122. If the scoring system expects different ranges or semantics, can this cause the checker's results to be misinterpreted by aggregators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Result vector size] The function always returns Ok(vec![single_result]). Are callers expecting exactly one result, or could there be issues if this behavior changes to return multiple results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Duration representation] Duration internally uses seconds and nanoseconds. Can very large durations near Duration::MAX cause issues when converting to milliseconds or performing arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Error collection unbounded] Before the check at line 89, errors can accumulate without limit within a single iteration. If provider.provide() returns errors rapidly, can this exhaust memory before the threshold check triggers? (Medium)"
