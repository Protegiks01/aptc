  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: RngArgs::key_generator()] [Weak randomness] Can an attacker who controls the random_seed parameter generate predictable private keys by supplying a low-entropy seed, enabling them to predict future account private keys and steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: RngArgs::from_seed()] [Cryptographic weakness] Does from_seed() properly validate that the input seed is 32 bytes, or can an attacker supply a shorter seed that gets zero-padded, reducing entropy and making key prediction attacks feasible? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: RngArgs::from_string_seed()] [Weak key generation] The from_string_seed() function uses assert!(str.len() < 32) and zero-pads the remaining bytes - can an attacker exploit this to generate keys with predictable entropy by using very short string seeds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: RngArgs::key_generator()] [Seed manipulation] Can an attacker extract or guess the hex-encoded seed from the random_seed field and regenerate the same private key, compromising account security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: RngArgs::from_seed()] [Deterministic keys] If from_seed() is used in production with a predictable seed value, can multiple accounts be compromised by an attacker who discovers the seed pattern? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::extract_private_key_cli()] [Key extraction bypass] Can an attacker bypass private key validation by manipulating the encoding parameter to extract keys in an unvalidated format? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::extract_private_key_and_address()] [Address spoofing] Can an attacker supply a mismatched private key and sender_account address to sign transactions as a different account, bypassing authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::extract_private_key()] [Profile manipulation] If an attacker modifies the profile configuration file, can they inject their own private key and sign transactions as the legitimate user? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: strip_private_key_prefix()] [Encoding bypass] Does strip_private_key_prefix() properly validate the key format, or can an attacker bypass validation by crafting malformed key encodings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::extract_private_key_input_from_cli_args()] [Information disclosure] Can an attacker exploit error messages from extract_private_key_input_from_cli_args() to determine if a private key exists without having access to it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::from_private_key()] [Key serialization] When converting Ed25519PrivateKey to encoded string, can encoding errors leak partial key information through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: PrivateKeyInputOptions::extract_ed25519_public_key_and_address()] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker exploit the fallback logic between CLI inputs and profile to use a different public key than the one corresponding to the private key being used for signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::load()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker use ConfigSearchMode::CurrentDirAndParents to load a malicious config file from a parent directory, injecting their own private keys or REST URLs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::save()] [Insecure permissions] Does save() create the config file with restrictive permissions (0600), or can other users on the system read private keys from the saved config? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::config_exists()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Can an attacker exploit a race condition between config_exists() check and subsequent load() to swap in a malicious config file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::load_profile()] [Profile injection] Can an attacker inject a malicious profile into the config that gets loaded instead of the intended profile, redirecting transactions to attacker-controlled addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::aptos_folder()] [Directory traversal] Can the aptos_folder() function be exploited to write config files outside the intended .aptos directory through path manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/types.rs] [Function: CliConfig::save()] [Atomic write violation] Does save() perform atomic file writes, or can a crash during save() leave the config in a corrupted state exposing partial private key data? (Medium)",
