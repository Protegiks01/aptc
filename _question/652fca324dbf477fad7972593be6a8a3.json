  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with extremely large string lengths (e.g., 2^32-1 bytes) for collection, token, old_uri, or new_uri fields to cause memory exhaustion and crash validator nodes during event deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does the BCS deserialization properly validate string length prefixes, or can an attacker provide crafted bytes with length prefix overflow causing buffer over-read and potential memory corruption during UriMutationEvent parsing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Denial of Service] Can malformed BCS bytes with deeply nested or recursive structures cause stack overflow during deserialization, leading to validator crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit BCS type confusion by providing bytes that deserialize to valid UriMutationEvent structure but contain invalid AccountAddress representations, bypassing downstream validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource exhaustion] Does try_from_bytes() impose any limits on the total event size, or can an attacker create events with combined string fields totaling gigabytes causing memory exhaustion during indexing and API queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] Does the error conversion from bcs::Error via Into::into properly preserve error context, or can error information leakage expose internal state or memory addresses useful for exploit development? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Replay attack] Since try_from_bytes() accepts any valid BCS bytes without timestamp or nonce validation, can an attacker replay identical URI mutation events across different transactions to confuse indexers and analytics systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Unicode exploitation] Can malicious BCS bytes containing invalid UTF-8 sequences or Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., homoglyph attacks in URIs) bypass validation and cause inconsistent behavior across validators with different Unicode handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] The new() constructor accepts arbitrary String values without any validation - can an attacker create UriMutationEvent with empty strings for collection/token/URIs causing downstream parsing failures or database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [String injection] Can an attacker inject SQL injection payloads, NoSQL injection, or command injection strings into collection, token, or URI fields that get stored unsanitized and later exploited when queried by indexers or explorers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [XSS attack] Since new() accepts arbitrary URI strings without validation, can an attacker inject JavaScript payloads (e.g., 'javascript:alert(1)') into new_uri field that execute when displayed in block explorers or wallets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Path traversal] Can malicious URIs containing path traversal sequences (../../etc/passwd) be stored via new() and later exploited if the URI is used by off-chain systems that resolve file paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [SSRF attack] Can attacker-controlled URIs pointing to internal network resources (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) be stored and later triggered when indexers or wallets attempt to fetch metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [State inconsistency] Does new() validate that old_uri differs from new_uri, or can attackers create no-op mutation events where old_uri == new_uri causing confusion in event logs and wasting storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Creator spoofing] Since new() accepts any AccountAddress as creator without cryptographic verification, can malicious Move code create events claiming to be from different creators, enabling phishing attacks where fake collections appear legitimate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Collection impersonation] Can an attacker create UriMutationEvent with collection/token names identical to popular NFT collections but different creator addresses, confusing users and enabling NFT phishing scams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Null byte injection] Can strings containing null bytes (\\0) be stored via new() causing truncation or parsing errors in C-based indexers or databases expecting null-terminated strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Unicode homoglyph] Can attackers use Unicode homoglyphs in collection/token names (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' vs Latin 'a') to create visually identical but distinct events, enabling phishing and brand impersonation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: creator()] [Reference safety] The creator() function returns &AccountAddress - can concurrent access from multiple threads cause data races if the UriMutationEvent is modified during reading, violating Rust's safety guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: collection()] [Memory exposure] Does returning &String from collection() create opportunities for memory disclosure if the string contains padding bytes or uninitialized memory from BCS deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: token()] [Information leakage] Can token() getter expose sensitive information if token names contain private keys, passwords, or other secrets accidentally included by careless developers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: old_uri()] [URI validation bypass] Since old_uri() returns raw string without validation, can downstream consumers mishandle malformed URLs causing security vulnerabilities in systems that trust event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new_uri()] [Metadata poisoning] Can new_uri() return URLs pointing to malicious metadata JSON that exploits vulnerabilities in JSON parsers used by wallets and marketplaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Missing bounds] The struct definition has no size bounds on String fields - can this lead to events consuming gigabytes of storage, enabling storage exhaustion attacks on validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Field ordering] Does the field ordering in the struct match the BCS serialization order, or can field reordering cause deserialization failures and event processing inconsistencies across validators? (Medium)"
