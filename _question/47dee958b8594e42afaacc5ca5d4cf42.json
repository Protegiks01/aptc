  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Type: SubmissionStatus] [Tuple safety] The tuple (MempoolStatus, Option<DiscardedVMStatus>) has no validation - can invalid combinations be created causing incorrect status reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Type: MempoolClientSender] [Channel closure] If MempoolClientSender (mpsc::Sender) is closed, does this cause graceful shutdown or panic when clients try to send requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: ScheduledBroadcast::new()] [Zero duration] What happens if deadline equals Instant::now() exactly? Does the spawned task execute immediately or wait for the next event loop tick causing timing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: ScheduledBroadcast::new()] [Past deadline] If deadline < Instant::now(), the tokio task isn't spawned - does this mean poll() will immediately return Poll::Ready without any async wait, potentially causing tight loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: PeerSyncState] [Zero sender buckets] What happens if PeerSyncState::new() is called with num_sender_buckets=0? Does this create an empty HashMap that causes all updates to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: MultiBucketTimelineIndexIds] [Max u64 timeline IDs] If a timeline ID reaches u64::MAX and needs to increment, can this cause integer overflow that wraps to 0, making new transactions appear older than ancient ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: MempoolMessageId] [Empty message ID] Can MempoolMessageId(vec![]) be compared with non-empty message IDs using Ord, and does this cause unexpected behavior in BTreeMap/BTreeSet operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: BroadcastInfo] [SystemTime overflow] If SystemTime values in sent_messages overflow (e.g., far future timestamps), can duration calculations panic or produce incorrect timeout values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: MempoolMessageId::from_timeline_ids()] [Panic propagation] The assert! statements for timeline_index_identifier and sender_bucket can panic - can these panics propagate to calling code and crash the entire mempool service? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: notify_subscribers()] [Error accumulation] Since send errors are silently ignored, can accumulated failures across multiple subscribers go unnoticed until critical components miss state updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: QuorumStoreRequest] [Callback panic] If processing GetBatchRequest or RejectNotification panics before sending a response to the oneshot::Sender, does this leave consensus hanging indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: MempoolClientRequest] [Timeout handling] If mempool processing takes too long and clients timeout their oneshot::Receiver, does this cause the Sender to fail when attempting to respond, potentially leaking resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: MultiBucketTimelineIndexIds::update()] [Silent failure] The function returns early on validation failures without error indication - can this cause calling code to assume success when updates actually failed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: MempoolMessageId] [Deserialization bomb] Can a Byzantine peer send serialized MempoolMessageId with millions of (u64, u64) pairs causing memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: MultiBucketTimelineIndexIds] [Vec size attack] Can deserialized MultiBucketTimelineIndexIds contain id_per_bucket vectors with gigabytes of data causing OOM when processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: PeerSyncState] [Network protocol mismatch] If different network protocol versions encode PeerSyncState differently, can this cause deserialization failures or silent data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Impl: Display for QuorumStoreRequest] [Log injection] Can transaction counts or other display values be manipulated to inject malicious strings into logs via the Display implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: SharedMempoolNotification] [Event ordering] Do PeerStateChange, NewTransactions, ACK, and Broadcast notifications have defined ordering requirements, or can out-of-order delivery cause state machine violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: PeerSyncState::update()] [Idempotency] Is update() idempotent when called multiple times with the same MempoolMessageId, or can repeated updates cause timeline IDs to advance incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: BroadcastInfo] [State transition atomicity] Can concurrent modifications to sent_messages and retry_messages cause a message to be in inconsistent states (e.g., marked as both sent and retry)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: broadcast_within_validator_network()] [Consensus coordination] During quorum store rollback (false->true transition), can miscoordination between mempool broadcast and quorum store batching cause double-submission or loss of transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: ScheduledBroadcast] [Task cleanup] When ScheduledBroadcast is dropped while the tokio task is still sleeping, does the task leak or continue running unnecessarily consuming resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: BroadcastInfo] [Stale message cleanup] Is there a mechanism to remove old entries from sent_messages based on SystemTime, or can ancient broadcasts accumulate indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: PeerSyncState] [Timeline pruning] When peers disconnect and reconnect, are their PeerSyncState timelines reset, or can stale timeline IDs cause transactions to be skipped on reconnection? (High)",
