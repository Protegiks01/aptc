  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: TransactionsBlob] [Empty Transactions] Can TransactionsBlob contain an empty transactions vector, and if so, does this cause issues when indexers expect BLOB_TRANSACTION_CHUNK_SIZE transactions per blob? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: TransactionsBlob] [String Format] Are the transaction strings in a specific format (JSON, Base64, etc.), and can malformed strings cause deserialization failures or injection attacks in downstream processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: TransactionsBlob] [Version Overflow] If starting_version is close to u64::MAX, can adding BLOB_TRANSACTION_CHUNK_SIZE cause overflow, resulting in incorrect version calculations for transactions in the blob? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Struct: TransactionsBlob] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker upload TransactionsBlob with millions of transaction strings causing memory exhaustion when deserialized, leading to indexer crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: generate_blob_name()] [Path Traversal] Does the format!() macro on line 55 allow path traversal if starting_version contains special characters or can be manipulated to include '../' sequences to write blobs outside intended directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: generate_blob_name()] [Collision Vulnerability] Can two different starting_version values generate the same blob name, causing newer blobs to overwrite older ones and resulting in permanent transaction data loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: generate_blob_name()] [Version Gaps] If starting_version values are not multiples of BLOB_TRANSACTION_CHUNK_SIZE, can this create overlapping or gap blobs that cause indexers to skip or double-process transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: generate_blob_name()] [Enumeration Attack] Does the predictable naming scheme (blobs/{version}.json) allow attackers to enumerate all transaction blobs and potentially extract sensitive transaction data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Function: generate_blob_name()] [Integer to String] Can extreme values of starting_version (e.g., u64::MAX = 18446744073709551615) cause issues with file system path length limits or cloud storage naming constraints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Constant: BLOB_TRANSACTION_CHUNK_SIZE] [Hardcoded Value] The chunk size of 1000 transactions on line 8 is hardcoded - can changing network transaction throughput cause misalignment where some blobs are under-filled or over-filled, breaking version tracking assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Constant: BLOB_FOLDER_NAME] [Directory Traversal] Can an attacker modify the BLOB_FOLDER_NAME constant or inject malicious values to cause blobs to be written to unintended storage locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Constant: METADATA_FILE_NAME] [Single Point of Failure] Having a single metadata.json file on line 12 creates a single point of failure - can corruption of this one file cause total indexer service unavailability across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Constant: JSON_FILE_TYPE] [Content Type Validation] Is the application/json content type on line 13 validated when downloading files, or can attackers upload non-JSON files with .json extensions to cause parsing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Metadata-Blob Consistency] Can metadata.version point to a non-existent blob (e.g., blob file deleted but metadata not updated), causing indexers to fail when trying to resume from the recorded version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Version Synchronization] If multiple indexers independently call upload_file_store_metadata() with different version values, can this cause version conflicts where indexers diverge in their view of the current state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Blob Upload Timing] Can the metadata be updated before all blobs for that version range are fully uploaded, causing indexers to attempt reading incomplete blobs and encountering errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Chain ID Validation] Is chain_id validated against the actual blockchain's chain_id before processing, or can mismatched chain_id values cause indexers to process transactions from testnets on mainnet infrastructure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Async Safety] Are the async functions (get_file_store_metadata, upload_file_store_metadata) safe for concurrent execution, or can they cause data races when accessed from multiple async tasks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Integration] [Error Recovery] If upload_file_store_metadata() panics via .unwrap(), is there any transaction rollback or cleanup mechanism, or does this leave the system in an inconsistent state with orphaned blobs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Cloud Storage] [Bucket Permissions] Does the code validate GCS bucket permissions before operations, or can misconfigured buckets allow unauthorized read/write access to metadata and transaction blobs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Cloud Storage] [Credential Exposure] Are cloud storage credentials properly secured, or can they be extracted from running indexer processes to gain unauthorized access to all stored transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Cloud Storage] [Data Encryption] Are metadata and transaction blobs encrypted at rest in cloud storage, or can an attacker with storage access read all historical transaction data in plaintext? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Cloud Storage] [Object Versioning] Does the cloud storage implementation support object versioning to recover from accidental or malicious deletions of metadata or blobs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Cloud Storage] [Bucket Takeover] Can an attacker perform a bucket takeover attack by creating a bucket with the same name if the original bucket is accidentally deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Serialization] [Additional Fields] If the JSON metadata contains additional unexpected fields, does serde silently ignore them or reject the deserialization, potentially hiding malicious data? (Low)"
