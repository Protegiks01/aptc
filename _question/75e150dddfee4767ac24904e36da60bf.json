(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/templates.rs] [Function: expand()] [Test Result Manipulation] Can templates expanded by expand() manipulate test outcomes to hide security vulnerabilities, causing vulnerable code to pass tests and merge into production branches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/templates.rs] [Function: expand()] [Empty Template Handling] Does expand() safely handle empty strings or whitespace-only templates, or can edge cases cause unexpected errors or parser confusion in downstream test processing?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/templates.rs] [Function: mangle()] [Empty String Mangling] Does mangle() properly handle empty strings or strings with only special characters, or can these edge cases return invalid identifiers that break Move parser?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/templates.rs] [Function: get_arg1()] [Key Name Injection] Does get_arg1() validate that the key parameter matches expected values, or can typos or malicious key names cause incorrect error messages or behavior?
