  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker provide malformed bytecode or source files that cause the SourceContext fields (left, highlight, remainder) to allocate unbounded memory, leading to OOM crashes in the bytecode viewer tool? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [String injection] If SourceContext.highlight or SourceContext.remainder contain malicious terminal escape sequences or ANSI codes from untrusted bytecode comments, can this lead to terminal injection attacks when displayed to developers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [Data integrity] Does the SourceContext struct have any validation to ensure that left + highlight + remainder form a coherent view, or can inconsistent string boundaries cause display corruption or information disclosure? (Low)",

(Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: LeftScreen] [Method: backing_string] [Content validation] Does backing_string() perform any sanitization on the returned string, or can malicious bytecode inject escape sequences or binary data that corrupt terminal displays? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: LeftScreen] [Type: SourceIndex] [Type confusion] Can different LeftScreen implementations use incompatible SourceIndex types that cause type confusion when mixed in generic contexts, leading to logic errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: LeftScreen] [Type: SourceIndex] [Lifetime issues] Does the associated type SourceIndex have proper lifetime constraints to prevent dangling references when the LeftScreen implementation is dropped while SourceIndex references exist?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: RightScreen] [Method: source_for_code_location] [Invalid index handling] If bytecode_info parameter contains corrupted FunctionDefinitionIndex or CodeOffset values from a malformed module, can this cause panics or incorrect source mapping leading to confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: RightScreen] [Method: source_for_code_location] [Context window attack] Can an attacker craft bytecode with code locations that cause source_for_code_location to return SourceContext with extremely large context windows (CONTEXT_SIZE), exhausting memory?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: RightScreen] [Method: backing_string] [File content exposure] Does backing_string() return the entire source file contents without redaction, potentially exposing sensitive comments or credentials in source code to unauthorized viewers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Trait: RightScreen] [Generic constraint] [Type safety] Can the Indexer: LeftScreen generic bound be violated by passing incompatible types, causing type confusion between different bytecode viewer implementations? (Low)",
