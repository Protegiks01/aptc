  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Import: SignedTransaction] [Trust Boundary] Does SignedTransaction at line 11 guarantee that transactions returned at line 141 are already signature-verified, or must this file perform additional validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Precision Issues] Can the millisecond precision at line 35-41 cause timing vulnerabilities where validators disagree on expiration by microseconds, affecting consensus safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Reverse Ordering] Is the Reverse wrapper at line 61 correctly applied to ensure min-heap behavior, or can it be misconfigured causing max-heap behavior and incorrect expiration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: BatchSortKey::cmp()] [Comparison Consistency] Does the cmp() implementation at line 195-203 satisfy transitivity and reflexivity requirements of Ord trait, or can it cause undefined behavior in sorting algorithms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: MempoolProxy::pull_internal()] [Boolean Flag] What is the significance of the 'true' boolean at line 120 in GetBatchRequest, and can flipping it bypass important validation or filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Struct: Timeouts] [Lifecycle] Can Timeouts instance be reused after expire() drains items at line 53-56, or does it require reinitialization to maintain invariants? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Struct: TimeExpirations] [Lifecycle] After expire() removes items at line 78-89, can the same items be re-added with different expiry times, causing duplicate tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Struct: MempoolProxy] [Connection State] If the mempool channel at line 98 disconnects, does pull_internal() at line 110-147 handle reconnection, or does it permanently fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Quadratic Complexity] Can the take_while + count + drain pattern at lines 47-54 have O(n²) behavior under certain conditions, enabling DoS through algorithmic complexity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Heap Operations] Can adversarial insertion patterns cause BinaryHeap at line 61 to degrade to worst-case performance, slowing consensus to a halt? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: BatchSortKey::cmp()] [Comparison Cost] Can expensive author PeerId comparison operations at line 202 (if PeerId has complex internal structure) create DoS vectors during sorting? (Low)"
