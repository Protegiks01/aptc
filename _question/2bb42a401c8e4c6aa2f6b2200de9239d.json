(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_se()] [Serialization Invariants] Are there untested invariants (e.g., serialize then deserialize equals identity) that if violated could cause silent data corruption in DKG protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Discrete Log Security] Does deserialization maintain the discrete log hardness assumption, or can specially crafted points with known discrete logs be injected to break DKG security proofs?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [DKG Key Recovery] If deserialization is used to reconstruct validator signing keys from DKG shares, can validation gaps allow attackers to force reconstruction of weak or backdoored keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Threshold Signature Malleability] When deserializing threshold signature shares, can malleability in point representation allow an attacker to create alternative valid shares that produce different combined signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Invalid Curve Attack] Can attackers exploit deserialization to inject points from isogenous curves with equivalent group structure but weaker security parameters, enabling efficient discrete log attacks on validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Composite Order Subgroup] Does validation ensure points are in the prime-order subgroup r, or can composite-order subgroup elements enable small subgroup confinement attacks on DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Pairing Non-Degeneracy] Can deserialized points cause pairing operations to become degenerate (always outputting identity), breaking BLS signature and DKG verification logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_se()] [Point Doubling Detection] Can serialization timing reveal whether a point is the result of point doubling vs addition, leaking information about validator key generation processes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Deserialization State Transition] Can repeated deserialization calls with partially overlapping Bytes input at line 22 cause state machine confusion where validation state from one call affects another?
