  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Information Disclosure] Can the error.to_string() conversion at line 25 leak sensitive internal state information (database paths, memory addresses, stack traces, validator private keys, or account balances) from framework errors that should be sanitized before external exposure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Error Classification Bypass] Can an attacker craft custom error types that manipulate the has_source() check at line 26 to bypass error sanitization, causing internal errors to be returned directly without conversion to the safe WebFrameworkError format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Type Confusion] Does the heuristic 'errors we return have no source, whereas those returned by the framework do' (lines 22-24) create a type confusion vulnerability where attackers can inject errors that appear as framework errors but contain malicious payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Race Condition] Since convert_error is async and called for all API errors, can concurrent error handling lead to race conditions where error_string captures transient state that gets modified before build_error_response() processes it, causing inconsistent error responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger framework errors with extremely large error messages that consume excessive memory during the to_string() conversion at line 25, causing API memory exhaustion or OOM crashes affecting validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Error Injection] If an attacker controls input that influences framework error generation, can they inject malicious strings into error_string (line 25) that exploit downstream JSON serialization, logging systems, or monitoring tools consuming these errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Authentication Bypass] When authentication or authorization failures occur, are they properly classified as framework errors and converted, or can they bypass the error converter and expose sensitive authentication details like validator credentials or API keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Response Tampering] At line 31, response.set_body(build_error_response(error_string).take_body()) replaces the response body - can this manipulation introduce inconsistencies between HTTP status codes and error codes, confusing clients and potentially bypassing security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Header Injection] Does the manual insertion of CONTENT_TYPE header at line 34 properly validate and sanitize the JSON constant, or can header injection vulnerabilities arise if the mime_types::JSON constant is compromised or misconfigured? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [State Leakage] Can transaction execution errors or consensus state errors leak through convert_error() exposing validator voting patterns, mempool contents, pending transaction details, or other sensitive state information to unauthorized API callers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [DoS via Error Loops] If build_error_response() itself throws an error, can this create an infinite error handling loop that exhausts API resources and causes denial of service affecting all API endpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Timing Attack] Does the branching between framework and non-framework error paths (lines 27-38) introduce timing differences that could leak information about internal error types through timing side-channels observable to external attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Error Code Confusion] When framework errors are converted to WebFrameworkError code 601, does this generic categorization prevent proper security monitoring and incident response by masking the true nature of critical errors like consensus failures or VM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Cross-Origin Leakage] If CORS headers are set before error conversion, can error responses leak to unauthorized origins exposing internal error details that should be restricted to authenticated API clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Transaction Privacy] When transaction submission errors occur (invalid signatures, sequence number mismatches, VM errors), can error messages leak information about other users' transaction patterns, account states, or validator selection strategies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Information Disclosure] Does the AptosError::new_with_error_code() call at line 42 properly sanitize the error_string parameter, or can it include sensitive debugging information like file paths, line numbers, or internal variable values from Poem framework errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [JSON Injection] Can malicious error_string values at line 42 break JSON serialization by containing unescaped quotes, control characters, or exploit JSON parsing vulnerabilities in client applications consuming these error responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Error Code Hardcoding] By hardcoding WebFrameworkError code 601 at line 44, does this prevent distinguishing between different types of framework failures (network timeouts, invalid requests, internal server errors) that should have different security responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Serialization Failure] If Json::into_response() fails during serialization at line 46, does this create an unhandled error that crashes the API server or leaves connections in inconsistent states affecting validator API connectivity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Response Size] Can extremely verbose framework error messages cause build_error_response() to generate oversized JSON responses that exceed API size limits or network MTU, causing fragmentation attacks or dropped responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Information Disclosure] Does the error! logging macro at line 50 log the full panic payload including potentially sensitive data like private keys, authentication tokens, or transaction contents to log files accessible to unauthorized parties? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Panic Suppression] By converting panics to 'internal error' responses at line 51, does this hide critical bugs in consensus, VM execution, or state management that should immediately halt the validator to prevent state corruption or safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [State Corruption] When a panic occurs during transaction processing or state queries, can the panic_handler allow the API to continue serving requests from corrupted state since the panic is caught and converted rather than propagating to restart mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Resource Leak] Do panics captured by panic_handler properly clean up resources (database connections, file handles, network sockets, mutex locks) or can repeated panics cause resource exhaustion leading to validator performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Panic Amplification] Can an attacker trigger specific API requests that cause panics, and by repeatedly invoking panic_handler, overwhelm logging systems or monitoring infrastructure causing secondary denial of service?
