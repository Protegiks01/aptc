  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: finish_abort()] [Incarnate failure handling] If try_incarnate fails because another thread succeeded, does returning Retry properly allow the other thread's work to proceed, or can both threads deadlock? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: finish_abort()] [Set aborted status order] Is calling set_aborted_status before decrease_validation_idx the correct order to prevent races with concurrent try_commit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: try_abort()] [Double abort prevention] Does the check 'status == Executed(incarnation)' prevent double aborts, or can two threads both see Executed and both successfully transition to Aborting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: try_abort()] [Write lock contention] Is acquiring a write lock for every try_abort attempt efficient, or can high contention cause validation failures to cascade and degrade performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt()] [Done marker swap] Can the swap operation on done_marker race such that multiple threads all see 'false' before the swap, causing multiple threads to attempt halt_transaction_execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt()] [Has halted swap] Does the has_halted flag prevent duplicate halt attempts, or can the second swap also return false, indicating a logic error in halt counting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt()] [Transaction iteration] When iterating all transactions 0..num_txns to halt them, can newly spawned worker threads race and see some transactions as non-halted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt_transaction_execution()] [Condvar notification] When notifying condvar with notify_one(), is it guaranteed that exactly one waiting thread wakes up, or can multiple threads wait on the same condvar? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt_transaction_execution()] [Status replacement] Does mem::replace with ExecutionHalted(true) properly handle all status variants, or can some states be incorrectly handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt_transaction_execution()] [Safely finished flag] When setting ExecutionHalted(false) for Executing/Aborting states, can finish_execution/finish_abort fail to set safely_finished back to true, violating the invariant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: halt_transaction_execution()] [Lock acquisition] Does acquiring write lock on txn_status prevent all concurrent status updates, or can reads happen concurrently with potentially stale data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: has_halted()] [Relaxed ordering] Is Relaxed memory ordering sufficient for reading has_halted, or can reordering cause threads to miss the halt signal and continue executing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: prepare_for_block_epilogue()] [Epilogue index] When block_epilogue_idx < num_txns, does prepare_for_block_epilogue properly ensure the transaction is halted with safely_finished == true before allowing re-execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: prepare_for_block_epilogue()] [Status transition] Is transitioning from ExecutionHalted to Ready(1, Execution) safe, or can concurrent threads still hold references to the old halted status? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: is_executed()] [Include committed flag] When include_committed is true in wait_for_dependency but false in try_validate_next_version, can this inconsistency cause races where dependencies are resolved but validations are skipped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: is_executed()] [Read lock duration] Does acquiring a read lock on txn_status provide sufficient isolation, or can the status change immediately after the lock is released, invalidating the returned incarnation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: never_executed()] [Incarnation 0 check] Does checking for incarnation 0 in Ready/Executing/Suspended states correctly identify never-executed transactions, or can aborts reset incarnation back to 0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: done()] [Acquire ordering] Is Acquire memory ordering on done_marker sufficient to ensure all prior writes are visible when done() returns true, or can weak memory models reorder operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: should_coordinate_commits()] [Lock stealing] If multiple threads call should_coordinate_commits() concurrently, can try_lock allow multiple threads to believe they should coordinate commits? (High)",
