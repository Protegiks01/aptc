  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: collection_name] [Case sensitivity] Are collection names case-sensitive in event matching, or can attackers emit events for 'MyCollection' vs 'mycollection' to create confusion about which collection was actually mutated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: collection_name] [Whitespace manipulation] Can collection_name have leading/trailing whitespace or internal whitespace variations that create duplicate-appearing collections with different canonical representations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Address spoofing] Does the event struct validate that creator_addr matches the actual transaction sender or collection owner, or can any address emit CollectionMaximumMutate events claiming to be from arbitrary creators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [System address abuse] Can creator_addr be set to system addresses (0x0, 0x1, 0x3, etc.) to make events appear as if they came from core framework modules, potentially confusing indexers or granting unauthorized privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Null address] Is creator_addr = 0x0 (null address) a valid value, and could this be exploited to create orphaned collections or events that break assumptions about creator existence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Cross-account event emission] Can events be emitted with creator_addr pointing to victim accounts without their authorization, enabling reputation damage or false event attribution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Getter: creator_addr()] [Reference exposure] Does creator_addr() return an immutable reference safely, or could long-lived references enable time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities if the event is mutated concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] Does MODULE_NAME = 'token_event_store' correctly match the actual Move module that emits these events, or could a mismatch cause events to be misrouted or fail validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name collision] Is STRUCT_NAME = 'CollectionMaximumMutate' unique across all Aptos event types, or could name collisions cause events from different modules to be incorrectly deserialized as CollectionMaximumMutate? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version incompatibility] Does implementing MoveEventV2Type guarantee backward compatibility with older event indexers, or could version mismatches cause events to be dropped or misinterpreted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [TypeTag manipulation] Can the TypeTag in COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE be manipulated or replaced at runtime to cause type confusion when events are matched against expected types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [TOKEN_ADDRESS verification] Does TOKEN_ADDRESS correctly identify the token module, or could it point to a malicious module allowing attackers to inject fake collection events that pass type checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Could concurrent access to COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE during Lazy initialization cause race conditions or multiple initializations creating inconsistent TypeTag references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_TYPE] [Empty type_args vulnerability] Does type_args: vec![] properly indicate no generic parameters, or could this be exploited to bypass generic type validation in parameterized event handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Event replay] Is there any sequence number or nonce in CollectionMaximumMutate to prevent replay attacks where the same mutation event is processed multiple times across different transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Timestamp missing] Does CollectionMaximumMutate include a timestamp field for ordering events, or can attackers manipulate event ordering to make newer mutations appear older than they actually are? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Transaction context loss] Does the event preserve transaction hash or version for audit trails, or is critical context lost making it impossible to verify when/how the mutation occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Concurrent mutations] Can multiple CollectionMaximumMutate events be emitted in the same transaction or block for the same collection, creating ambiguity about the final maximum value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Cross-transaction consistency] If events are processed asynchronously by indexers, can event reordering cause them to see maximum values in non-chronological order breaking consistency guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Event-state divergence] Can CollectionMaximumMutate events be emitted without actually updating the on-chain collection maximum state, creating divergence between event history and actual state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: old_maximum] [Stale old_maximum] If old_maximum is cached before the mutation but the state changes concurrently, can events record incorrect old_maximum values that don't reflect the actual pre-mutation state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Atomic emission] Are CollectionMaximumMutate events emitted atomically with state changes, or could transaction failures leave events emitted but state unchanged (or vice versa)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Event suppression] Can transaction signers or validators suppress CollectionMaximumMutate events while still performing the mutation, hiding maximum changes from indexers and users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionMaximumMutate] [Rollback handling] If a transaction with CollectionMaximumMutate events is rolled back due to consensus failure, are the events properly invalidated or could they remain visible causing false mutation records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate.rs] [Field: new_maximum] [Artificial scarcity manipulation] Can collection creators emit false CollectionMaximumMutate events with decreasing new_maximum to artificially create scarcity and manipulate NFT floor prices on marketplaces?
