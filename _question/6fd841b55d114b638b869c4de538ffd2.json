  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Trait: std::io::Write] [Flush Semantics] Does the flush() no-op implementation for hashers comply with std::io::Write contract, or can code expecting flush() to have side effects misuse hashers, causing incomplete hash computations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Macro: define_hasher!] [Seed Collision] Can different hasher types generated by define_hasher! end up with identical seeds if their salt strings hash to the same value, breaking domain separation between TransactionAccumulator and EventAccumulator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Macro: define_hasher!] [OnceCell Race] Is OnceCell initialization for SEED_NAME thread-safe during concurrent hasher creation, or can race conditions cause different validators to compute different seeds during epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Macro: define_hasher!] [Lazy Static Ordering] Does the Lazy<$hasher_type> initialization guarantee deterministic ordering, or can initialization order differences cause subtle hash computation variations across validator restarts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Macro: define_hasher!] [Clone Safety] Does the generated Clone implementation for hasher types properly copy the internal Sha3 state, or can cloned hashers share mutable state causing data races in parallel execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Macro: define_hasher!] [Default Immutability] Does default() returning a clone of the static HASHER ensure proper isolation, or can mutations to the default instance affect future default() calls, breaking hash determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Hasher: TransactionAccumulatorHasher] [Accumulator Collision] Can attackers find transaction sequences where internal TransactionAccumulator node hashes collide, allowing them to forge Merkle proofs and convince light clients of non-existent transactions?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Hasher: SparseMerkleInternalHasher] [Leaf-Internal Confusion] Does SparseMerkleInternalHasher have sufficient domain separation from leaf node hashes to prevent confusion attacks where internal nodes are interpreted as leaf values, corrupting state?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Hasher: DummyHasher] [Production Usage] Is DummyHasher restricted to test environments only, or can it accidentally be used in production code paths, creating predictable hashes that enable attacks on validator selection? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Function: create_literal_hash()] [Padding Vulnerability] Does create_literal_hash() zero-pad strings consistently, or can padding differences cause ACCUMULATOR_PLACEHOLDER_HASH to have different values across platforms with different endianness?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Function: create_literal_hash()] [Collision Risk] Can a legitimately computed hash coincidentally equal one of the literal hashes (e.g., CORRUPTION_SENTINEL), causing the system to misinterpret valid data as corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Static: ACCUMULATOR_PLACEHOLDER_HASH] [Placeholder Confusion] Can attackers craft transactions whose hashes legitimately equal ACCUMULATOR_PLACEHOLDER_HASH, causing the accumulator to confuse real transactions with empty slots and lose transaction data?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Static: SPARSE_MERKLE_PLACEHOLDER_HASH] [State Corruption] If SPARSE_MERKLE_PLACEHOLDER_HASH appears as a legitimate state value hash, can this cause the Merkle tree to treat occupied nodes as empty, allowing state deletion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Static: CORRUPTION_SENTINEL] [Sentinel Bypass] Can attackers deliberately set values to CORRUPTION_SENTINEL to trigger corruption detection, causing false positives that halt validators and create liveness failures? (High)",
