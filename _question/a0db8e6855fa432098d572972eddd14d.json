  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Error handling inconsistency] The function bails on unexpected terms but has already modified the map - if called in a transaction context, can partial map updates cause inconsistent state if the error is caught and recovered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [BTreeMap ordering attack] Does the BTreeMap ordering affect gas calculation determinism across validators with different string comparison implementations or locale settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Zero coefficient filtering] Terms with coefficient 0 are filtered in Mul case (lines 106-115), but not for standalone GasParam - can attackers exploit this asymmetry to create equivalent expressions with different representations causing calibration inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Panic in pattern matching] Can malformed DynamicExpression variants (e.g., nested Add/Mul not flattened) hit the catch-all patterns at lines 117-119 in production, causing calibration failures and validator errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: aggregate_terms()] [Hash collision DoS] Can attackers craft gas parameter names that hash to the same BTreeMap bucket (if string comparison is expensive), causing aggregation slowdowns that affect validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Trait: GasAlgebra] [Delegation inconsistency] Multiple methods delegate directly to self.base without recording abstract usage - can this incomplete tracking cause gas calibration to miss significant gas costs leading to underpriced operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: charge_storage_fee()] [Missing abstract tracking] The charge_storage_fee() method doesn't push to shared_buffer - can this omission cause storage operations to be untracked in calibration data, leading to incorrect storage gas pricing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: count_dependency()] [Missing abstract tracking] The count_dependency() method doesn't record abstract usage - can this allow dependency loading costs to be omitted from calibration leading to gas parameter underestimation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: inject_balance()] [Balance manipulation] Can inject_balance() be called during transaction execution to manipulate gas accounting, allowing transactions to bypass gas limits by injecting additional balance mid-execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: balance_internal()] [Stale balance] Does balance_internal() reflect the current state of shared_buffer modifications, or can race conditions cause it to return stale values leading to incorrect gas limit checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_consistency()] [Incomplete validation] The check_consistency() only validates the base algebra - can inconsistencies in shared_buffer (e.g., corrupted expressions, duplicate entries) go undetected causing calibration data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: vm_gas_params()] [Immutable reference safety] Can concurrent access to vm_gas_params() while charge_execution() modifies state cause use-after-free or data races if VMGasParameters contains non-thread-safe data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Function: feature_version()] [Version skew] If different validators have different feature_version values, can this cause them to evaluate the same expressions differently leading to state divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Expression evaluation] [Non-deterministic conversion] Can to_dynamic() produce different DynamicExpression structures for semantically equivalent GasExpression implementations, causing calibration inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Expression evaluation] [Floating point contamination] If any intermediate calculation in evaluate() uses floating point arithmetic, can rounding errors cause non-deterministic gas values across validators with different CPU architectures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Expression evaluation] [Overflow in evaluation] Can large coefficient multiplication in evaluate() overflow during gas calculation, causing validators to either panic or produce incorrect gas amounts leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [DynamicExpression] [Cyclic references] Can maliciously crafted DynamicExpression trees contain cycles (if Box indirection is exploited), causing expand_terms() to infinite loop and hang validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [DynamicExpression] [Type confusion] Can the enum variants (GasValue, GasParam, Mul, Add) be misinterpreted during deserialization or cross-language FFI, causing incorrect gas calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Shared buffer] [Unbounded growth] The shared_buffer vector has no size limit - can long-running transactions or blocks accumulate millions of expressions causing memory exhaustion and validator OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Shared buffer] [Reallocation DoS] Can repeated vector reallocation as shared_buffer grows cause memory fragmentation and performance degradation affecting validator consensus participation? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Error propagation] When base methods return PartialVMResult errors, are errors properly propagated without leaving CalibrationAlgebra in an inconsistent state with partial updates to shared_buffer? (High)"
