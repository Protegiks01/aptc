  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Function: sha3_256()] [Cryptographic vulnerability] Can an attacker provide maliciously crafted input bytes that cause the SHA3-256 implementation to produce colliding hashes, enabling forged transaction signatures or state commitment manipulation leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Function: sha3_256()] [Denial of Service] Does sha3_256() impose input size limits, or can an attacker submit extremely large byte arrays (e.g., gigabytes) causing memory exhaustion and validator node crashes during hash computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Function: sha3_256()] [Side-channel attack] Is the SHA3-256 computation constant-time with respect to input content, or can timing variations leak sensitive cryptographic material (private keys, validator secrets) through cache timing attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Function: sha3_256()] [Weak cryptography] Does the sha3 crate version used implement the final FIPS 202 standard, or does it use pre-standardization Keccak which has known collision vulnerabilities exploitable for transaction malleability? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Function: sha3_256()] [Memory safety] Can passing uninitialized or invalid byte slice references to sha3_256() trigger undefined behavior in unsafe code within the sha3 crate, potentially causing remote code execution on validator nodes?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Macro: debug_write!()] [Buffer overflow] When debug_write! writes to fixed-size buffers, can unbounded format arguments cause buffer overflows that corrupt adjacent memory containing consensus state or cryptographic keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Macro: debug_write!()] [Panic propagation] Does debug_write!'s error conversion properly handle panics during formatting (e.g., recursive Display implementations), or can it trigger unrecoverable panics that halt validator nodes?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/lib.rs] [Macro: debug_write!()] [Determinism violation] If debug_write! is used during transaction execution with non-deterministic formatting (timestamps, random values), can this cause validators to produce different execution results and break consensus?
