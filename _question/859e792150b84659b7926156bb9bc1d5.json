  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: layout_caches_enabled] [Non-Determinism] Can different cache hit/miss patterns across validators (due to layout_caches_enabled) cause subtle timing differences that lead to non-deterministic execution and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: layout_caches_enabled] [Race Condition in Cache] If multiple threads access layout caches concurrently, can race conditions cause cache corruption or incorrect layout retrieval leading to transaction execution errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: discard_failed_blocks] [Consensus Safety Violation] If discard_failed_blocks is enabled and different validators discard different blocks due to non-deterministic VM issues, can this cause chain forks and double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: discard_failed_blocks] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions that consistently fail on specific validators when discard_failed_blocks=true, causing those validators to discard valid blocks and lose consensus participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: discard_failed_blocks] [Block Censorship] With discard_failed_blocks enabled, can Byzantine validators selectively claim blocks fail execution to censor legitimate transactions without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: discard_failed_blocks] [Error Suppression] Does discard_failed_blocks silently hide critical BlockSTM/VM bugs that should halt the network, allowing vulnerabilities to be exploited until consensus catastrophically fails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Direct Genesis Injection] Can the genesis field be set directly via configuration for non-testing purposes, allowing attackers to bypass genesis file validation and inject arbitrary genesis transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Genesis Replacement] After genesis is loaded from file, can the in-memory genesis field be modified by subsequent configuration changes, causing validators to use inconsistent genesis state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Serialization Skip] The #[serde(skip)] attribute on genesis prevents it from being serialized - does this cause saved configurations to lose genesis data that should be persisted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Genesis Validation] Is the genesis Transaction validated to ensure it's a valid GenesisTransaction variant with proper WriteSetPayload structure before being used for chain initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_file_location] [Relative Path Injection] Can genesis_file_location be set to relative paths that resolve differently based on working directory, causing validators to load different genesis files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_file_location] [Empty Path Handling] When genesis_file_location is empty (PathBuf::new()), does load_from_path() correctly skip loading, or can empty checks be bypassed leading to unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_file_location] [Network Share Attack] Can genesis_file_location point to network-mounted filesystems (NFS, SMB) allowing man-in-the-middle attacks to inject malicious genesis data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/genesis_file_location] [Field: genesis_file_location] [Unicode Normalization] Can attackers use Unicode normalization tricks in genesis_file_location (e.g., homoglyphs) to make validators load different files than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_waypoint] [Waypoint Mismatch] Can validators run with inconsistent genesis_waypoint values causing them to have different views of the genesis state, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_waypoint] [Waypoint Bypass] If genesis_waypoint is None, does the system properly validate genesis state against expected values, or can any arbitrary genesis be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_waypoint] [WaypointConfig Type Confusion] Can the genesis_waypoint field be set to different WaypointConfig variants (FromConfig, FromFile, None) creating inconsistent waypoint validation across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_waypoint] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a WaypointConfig with version=0 but incorrect state root hash to pass genesis version checks while corrupting initial state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Unsafe Defaults] Does ExecutionConfig::default() provide secure-by-default settings, or do defaults like discard_failed_blocks=false and blockstm_v2_enabled=false need explicit security hardening? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Paranoid Checks Default] While paranoid_type_verification and paranoid_hot_potato_verification default to true, can these be accidentally overridden by partial config deserialization from untrusted sources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Concurrency Default Safety] The default concurrency_level=0 triggers automatic calculation - can the min(cores/2, 32) formula produce insecure values on systems with very few or many cores? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Default Consistency] Do all validators using ExecutionConfig::default() produce identical configurations, or can environmental differences (CPU count) cause divergent defaults affecting determinism? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Attribute: #[serde(default)]] [Partial Deserialization] If config deserialization partially fails, does #[serde(default)] cause remaining fields to use defaults, potentially mixing attacker-controlled and default values unsafely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Struct: ExecutionConfig] [Clone Safety] Since ExecutionConfig derives Clone, can cloning with a large genesis transaction in memory cause excessive memory allocation or performance issues? (Low)"
