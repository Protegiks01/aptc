  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Private Key Exposure] Can an attacker with file system access read the private key from memory dumps or swap files when the key is stored in the `ed25519_private_key` variable before encryption, potentially leading to complete account compromise? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Key Generation Weakness] Does the RNG initialization in `self.rng_args.key_generator()?.generate_ed25519_private_key()` use a cryptographically secure random number generator, or can an attacker predict generated keys through weak entropy sources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Input Validation Bypass] Can an attacker inject malformed private key strings through `read_line()` that bypass validation in `strip_private_key_prefix()` and `Ed25519PrivateKey::from_encoded_string()`, potentially causing crashes or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Private Key Persistence] When the user chooses to keep an existing key with empty input, does the code properly validate that the existing `profile_config.private_key` hasn't been corrupted or tampered with in the config file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Encoding Attack] Can an attacker exploit the `strip_private_key_prefix()` function to bypass key format validation by crafting specially formatted input that strips security-critical prefixes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Private Key Storage] Does the `profile_config.private_key = private_key` assignment store the key in plaintext in memory, making it vulnerable to memory scraping attacks or core dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Key Overwrite Vulnerability] When overwriting an existing profile, is the old private key securely wiped from memory and disk, or does it remain accessible through file recovery or memory forensics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Command Line Exposure] When using `self.private_key_options.extract_private_key_cli()`, can the private key be exposed through process listings, shell history, or system logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Message Leakage] Do error messages from `Ed25519PrivateKey::from_encoded_string()` leak sensitive information about the private key format or partial key material? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker use timing analysis on the `Ed25519PrivateKey::from_encoded_string()` validation to leak information about valid key formats or perform side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Directory Traversal] Can an attacker exploit `CliConfig::config_exists(ConfigSearchMode::CurrentDir)` to check for config files outside the intended directory through path traversal vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Config Injection] When loading an existing config with `CliConfig::load(ConfigSearchMode::CurrentDir)`, can an attacker inject malicious YAML that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) race condition between `CliConfig::config_exists()` and `CliConfig::load()` where an attacker can swap the config file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Profile Overwrite Attack] Can an attacker bypass the `prompt_yes_with_override()` confirmation by manipulating `self.prompt_options.assume_yes` to overwrite critical profiles without user consent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symlink at the config file location to cause the tool to write sensitive private keys to an attacker-controlled file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Permission Vulnerability] Does `config.save()` set appropriate restrictive file permissions (e.g., 0600) to prevent other users from reading the private key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Config Corruption] If `config.save()` fails mid-write due to disk space or I/O errors, can this leave the config file in a corrupted state that exposes partial private keys or causes denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Profile Name Injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or path traversal sequences in `profile_name` to write config data to arbitrary file locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [BTreeMap Collision] Can an attacker craft profile names that cause hash collisions in the `BTreeMap` to overwrite other profiles or cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Atomic Write Failure] Does `config.save()` use atomic file writes to prevent partial writes from being read, or can power loss/crashes expose incomplete configuration data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Ledger MITM Attack] When calling `aptos_ledger::fetch_batch_accounts(Some(0..5))`, can a malicious USB device or compromised driver return fake accounts to trick users into using attacker-controlled addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Derivation Path Validation Bypass] Can an attacker bypass `aptos_ledger::validate_derivation_path()` by crafting malicious path strings that pass validation but lead to predictable or attacker-controlled keys? (Critical)",
