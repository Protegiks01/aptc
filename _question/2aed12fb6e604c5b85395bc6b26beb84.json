  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider caching] If the MetricsProvider caches metric responses, can stale cached data from before the sleep delay cause false positives where the checker sees the same metric value twice? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Trait implementation vulnerability] Does the Checker trait's async check signature allow for proper error propagation, or can errors be silently swallowed causing undetected consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Module: checker] [Dependency vulnerabilities] The file imports from prometheus_parse crate - are there known vulnerabilities in Prometheus parsing libraries that could be exploited through malicious metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Function: check()] [CheckerError conversion] When returning CheckerError, are all possible error conditions properly represented, or can some errors be misclassified leading to incorrect severity assessment? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Overall design] [Monitoring bypass] Since this is a monitoring tool, can attackers who compromise the node-checker service disable or manipulate all consensus health checks, allowing Byzantine nodes to appear healthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Overall design] [False confidence] Can the checker's binary success/failure model give false confidence about consensus health, missing gradual degradation where rounds progress but with increasing latency or reduced throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Overall design] [Single metric dependency] The entire health check depends solely on 'aptos_consensus_last_committed_round' - if this metric becomes stale, incorrect, or manipulated, does the checker have any fallback validation mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Overall design] [Network partition scenarios] In a network partition where different validator sets progress on different forks, can this checker incorrectly report all partitions as healthy since each shows round progression within their partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Zero round values] If both previous_round and latest_round are 0 (genesis state or restart), does the checker correctly handle this as 'stalled' rather than 'progressing'? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_round.rs] [Function: check()] [Rapid progression] If consensus rounds progress multiple times during the sleep delay due to very fast block times, does the checker properly validate this, or could it miss micro-stalls between the measured rounds? (Low)"
