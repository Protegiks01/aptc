  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Related key attacks] Can an attacker who knows multiple EncryptPubKeys derived from related DecryptPrivKeys (e.g., dk, dk+1, dk*2) exploit relationships to derive private keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Backdoor parameters] Could PublicParameters contain backdoored values (like NIST curve parameters) that weaken the DKG security without being detectable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Computational DoS] Can an attacker provide PublicParameters that cause the mul() operation to take excessive time, delaying DKG and preventing validator set updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Resource exhaustion] Can repeated calls to to() with different parameters exhaust memory or CPU resources, causing validator nodes to crash during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Algorithmic complexity] Is the point multiplication algorithm's complexity predictable, or can adversarial inputs trigger worst-case performance scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Type confusion] Can type confusion between G1Projective and other group elements lead to using the wrong curve group for key derivation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Generic parameters] Are the generic parameters in the Convert trait properly constrained, or can incorrect type instantiations bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Lifetime violations] Can incorrect lifetime annotations allow PublicParameters to be dropped while still being referenced during mul(), causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Serialization bugs] When EncryptPubKey is serialized for network transmission, can serialization errors corrupt the key or leak private information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Deserialization attacks] Can maliciously crafted serialized PublicParameters cause vulnerabilities when deserialized and used in to()? (High)",
