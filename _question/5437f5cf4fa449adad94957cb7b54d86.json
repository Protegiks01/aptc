  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Multi-Exp Timing] Multi-exponentiation can have super-linear complexity - can adversarial input patterns cause worst-case O(n^2) timing that halts DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Signature Aggregation Cost] BLS aggregation requires pairing checks - can the number of pairings scale poorly with validator count, creating DoS opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Memory Allocation Pattern] The function allocates multiple large vectors - can allocation patterns be exploited to cause memory fragmentation and OOM in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Challenge Malleability] The Schnorr PoK uses Fiat-Shamir for non-interactive proofs - can challenge malleability allow replaying proofs in different contexts? (High)"
