  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [State Inconsistency] Can an attacker craft a malicious WriteResource that causes divergence between the Object and CurrentObject structs by exploiting the separate initialization logic, leading to indexer state corruption that breaks queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Input Validation] Does the function validate that txn_version is non-negative and within valid bounds before assigning it to transaction_version, or can negative/overflow values corrupt the historical object record ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Input Validation] Does the function validate that write_set_change_index is non-negative before creating the Object, or can malicious negative indices break the composite primary key integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Type Safety] Can an attacker exploit the placeholder value 0 passed to MoveResource::from_write_resource() to cause type confusion or incorrect resource parsing that corrupts the indexer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Data Integrity] If ObjectWithMetadata::from_write_resource() returns Some() but contains invalid object_core data, can this bypass validation and insert malformed objects into both historical and current tables? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Resource Cloning] Does the function properly handle guid_creation_num.clone() operations, or can BigDecimal cloning failures cause silent data loss or panics in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [State Consistency] Can concurrent calls to from_write_resource() with the same object_address but different txn_versions create race conditions where CurrentObject gets updated with stale data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Address Validation] Does the function validate that resource.address matches the expected object address format and constraints, or can malformed addresses bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Owner Address Validation] Does get_owner_address() perform proper validation, or can it return invalid/malicious addresses that corrupt the owner_address field in both Object and CurrentObject? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [State Key Hash Validation] Does the function validate state_key_hash format and uniqueness, or can hash collisions or malformed hashes break state lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Boolean Flag Manipulation] Can allow_ungated_transfer be manipulated in the write resource to bypass intended transfer restrictions at the indexer level? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Deletion Flag Security] Is is_deleted hardcoded to false without validation, allowing objects that should be marked deleted to appear active? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Return Value Handling] Can the Ok(None) return path be exploited to silently skip object creation without proper error reporting, causing missing objects in the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Error Propagation] Does the anyhow::Result properly propagate all errors from ObjectWithMetadata::from_write_resource(), or can certain error conditions be swallowed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Tuple Ordering] If the tuple return order (Object, CurrentObject) is reversed by mistake in calling code, can this cause database insertion errors or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Resource Type Check Bypass] Can an attacker craft a DeleteResource with a resource type that nearly matches '0x1::object::ObjectGroup' (e.g., with extra whitespace, different case, or Unicode tricks) to bypass the string comparison and skip proper deletion handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent deletions exploit the race between object_mapping lookup and database query in get_object_owner() to delete an object using stale ownership data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Database Query Timing Attack] If an attacker times their deletion operation during get_object_owner()'s retry window, can they cause the indexer to use wrong ownership data from an intermediate state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Missing Object Handling] When get_object_owner() fails and logs an error but returns Ok(None), does this allow objects to be permanently 'lost' without proper deletion tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Error Silencing] Is the error swallowing in the Err(_) match arm a security risk where legitimate database failures are hidden, allowing incomplete deletions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Ownership Change Attack] As noted in the comment, object owner can change—can an attacker exploit this by transferring ownership immediately before deletion to attribute the deletion to the wrong owner? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [HashMap Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate object_mapping to contain incorrect CurrentObject entries that cause deletions to use wrong previous_object data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Partial Deletion TODO] The TODO comment mentions unimplemented partial deletion detection—can attackers exploit this gap to partially delete objects without proper tracking, causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Transaction Version Validation] Does the function validate that txn_version is greater than previous_object.last_transaction_version to prevent out-of-order deletions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/v2_objects.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Deletion Flag Consistency] Can the is_deleted flag be set to true while other fields retain active state, creating inconsistent object records? (Medium)"
