  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Database corruption recovery] If the database becomes corrupted and accumulator nodes or root hashes are missing, can the pruner detect this condition and fail safely, or will it continue pruning and worsen the corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Rollback safety] If the node crashes after write_schemas() commits but before returning success, on restart will get_or_initialize_subpruner_progress return the updated progress, or can it return stale progress causing re-pruning attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Metadata key collision] Can there be namespace collisions between DbMetadataKey::TransactionAccumulatorPrunerProgress and other metadata keys that cause progress updates to overwrite critical system metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Version encoding] Are Version values properly encoded/decoded in DbMetadataValue::Version, or can encoding bugs cause progress to be read as a different value than written, leading to repeated pruning or skipped versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Progress initialization race] Can two nodes starting up simultaneously both call get_or_initialize_subpruner_progress and race on the initial write, potentially causing one node's progress to be silently overwritten? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Metadata persistence] Is DbMetadataSchema::put() operation guaranteed to be durable before write_schemas() returns, or can a crash immediately after leave progress updated in memory but not on disk? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Empty range] If current_progress == target_version, does TransactionAccumulatorDb::prune() handle the empty range [version, version) correctly, or can it trigger unexpected behavior in the for loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Version zero] Can current_progress=0 and target_version=1 cause the pruning algorithm to attempt deletion of version 0, and does Position::from_level_and_pos handle leaf_index=0 correctly without underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Maximum version] If target_version is u64::MAX-1 or u64::MAX, can the version loop or position calculations overflow when computing version+1 or related operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Large range pruning] If the version range (target_version - current_progress) is extremely large (e.g., billions of versions), can the SchemaBatch grow unbounded and cause OOM, or does it properly batch operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Proof verification] After pruning accumulator nodes, can clients still generate valid Merkle proofs for transactions at the pruned versions, or does the pruning break the accumulator invariant that proofs should remain verifiable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Tree structure] Can the selective pruning of left and right children in TransactionAccumulatorDb::prune() create an inconsistent tree structure where parent nodes reference deleted children, breaking accumulator invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Frozen subtree corruption] Does the pruning algorithm respect frozen subtrees that should never be deleted, or can it prune nodes from frozen subtrees that are required for proving historical transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Root hash consistency] After deleting TransactionAccumulatorRootHashSchema entries, can get_root_hash() still reconstruct correct root hashes from remaining accumulator nodes, or does this cause proof generation to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune() via find_first_ancestor_that_is_a_left_child] [Trailing ones overflow] Can version values where trailing_ones() returns 63 or 64 cause Position::from_level_and_pos() to panic or produce invalid positions due to the assertion level < 64? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune() via find_first_ancestor_that_is_a_left_child] [Bit shift overflow] When calculating index_in_level = version >> level, can large level values cause the shift to result in zero for all versions, making multiple versions map to the same position?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune() via find_first_ancestor_that_is_a_left_child] [Level calculation] Can the level calculation using trailing_ones() produce incorrect results for version patterns like 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, potentially causing wrong ancestor positions to be computed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune() via Position operations] [Left/right child safety] The code asserts !current.is_leaf() before calling left_child() and right_child(), but can the right_child traversal eventually reach a leaf and cause the next iteration to panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Schema batch size] Is there a limit on the number of delete operations that can be added to a SchemaBatch, or can pruning a large version range cause the batch to exceed RocksDB's write batch size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Column family consistency] Do TransactionAccumulatorSchema and TransactionAccumulatorRootHashSchema deletes target the correct RocksDB column families, or can schema misconfiguration cause deletes to be applied to wrong CFs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Key encoding] Are Position keys properly encoded via to_postorder_index() before deletion, or can encoding mismatches cause delete operations to target non-existent keys while leaving actual nodes unpruned?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Sub-pruner ordering] Since LedgerPruner executes LedgerMetadataPruner first then sub-pruners in parallel, can TransactionAccumulatorPruner complete before TransactionInfoPruner, leaving transaction infos that reference deleted accumulator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Target version consistency] Can LedgerPruner::set_target_version() be called during pruning, causing target_version to advance while TransactionAccumulatorPruner is mid-execution, leading to version range inconsistencies?
