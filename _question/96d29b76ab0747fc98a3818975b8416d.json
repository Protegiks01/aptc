  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: Lazy<T>] [Race Condition] When multiple threads first access a POSEIDON_* static simultaneously, could race conditions in Lazy::new() initialization cause partial or inconsistent initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: BN254_CONSTANTS] [Double Initialization] Could the constants() function be called multiple times concurrently, and if so, does this cause redundant computation or memory allocation issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Macro: neptune_constants!] [Thread-Local State] Does the macro use any thread-local state that could cause different constants to be initialized on different threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: POSEIDON_1 to POSEIDON_16] [Synchronization] Is there proper synchronization ensuring all 16 POSEIDON_* statics are fully initialized before any validator uses them for hashing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Trait: Lazy deref] [Memory Ordering] Does Lazy<T> use appropriate memory ordering (e.g., Acquire/Release) to ensure initialized constants are visible across threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: Initialization order] [Dependency Chain] If POSEIDON_* statics depend on BN254_CONSTANTS, is initialization order guaranteed to prevent reading uninitialized data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Function: constants()] [Reentrancy] Could the constants() function be reentered during initialization (e.g., via signal handler or async context), causing deadlock or corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: Global state] [State Pollution] Could modifications to global state elsewhere in the program affect constant initialization, causing non-deterministic values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Macro: neptune_constants!] [Clone Safety] Are the .clone() operations on vectors thread-safe, or could concurrent cloning cause data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Static: Lazy<T>] [Poisoning] If initialization of a Lazy static panics, does it poison the static preventing future access, and how is this handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Vector sharing] [Immutability] Are the constant vectors immutable after initialization, or could unsafe code modify them causing race conditions? (High)"
