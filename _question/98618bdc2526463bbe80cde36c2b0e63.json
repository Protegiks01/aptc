  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [All functions] [Interior mutability] Do any Storage variants use interior mutability (RefCell, Mutex) that could violate Rust's safety guarantees during concurrent access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Line 39: cfg(test)] [Testing features in production] Are all testing-only functions properly gated with #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'testing'))], or can dangerous functions leak into production builds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Accidental production reset] Even with cfg gates, can the 'testing' feature flag be accidentally enabled in production, allowing catastrophic data loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Testing key import in production] Is import_private_key() usage properly restricted to test code, or could it be called in production allowing backdoor key injection? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Enum: Storage] [Backend configuration tampering] Can attackers modify storage backend configuration (e.g., Vault endpoints, file paths) to redirect key operations to attacker-controlled storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Function: available()] [Stale availability cache] Does available() cache results, and if so, can stale cache entries cause operations on unavailable storage leading to data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [All functions] [Memory zeroization] Are sensitive data structures (Ed25519PrivateKey, etc.) properly zeroized from memory after use, or can they be recovered from memory dumps? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [All functions] [Resource exhaustion] Can attackers trigger excessive memory or storage allocation by repeatedly calling create_key() or set() with large payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Function: sign<T: CryptoHash + Serialize>()] [Trait bound bypass] Can attackers craft types that satisfy CryptoHash + Serialize bounds but have malicious implementations that compromise signature security? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Functions: sign() and sign_using_version()] [Signature scheme confusion] Can mixing sign() and sign_using_version() calls on the same key lead to signature scheme confusion or protocol-level vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Functions: get_public_key() and get_public_key_previous_version()] [Public key consistency] Is there guaranteed consistency between current and previous public keys, or can race conditions cause them to become inconsistent? (High)",
