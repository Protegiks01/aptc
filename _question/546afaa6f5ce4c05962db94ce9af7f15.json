  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Information Disclosure] Does the Error enum expose sensitive internal paths, configuration values, or system information through error messages that could aid attackers in reconnaissance or exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: ConfigSanitizerFailed] [Security Bypass] Can an attacker craft malformed configurations that cause ConfigSanitizerFailed errors to be silently caught or logged without halting node startup, allowing insecure validator configurations to persist in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: ConfigSanitizerFailed] [Validator Security] If ConfigSanitizerFailed errors are improperly handled in mainnet validator initialization, can this allow validators to start with disabled mutual authentication or weak safety rules configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: InvariantViolation] [Consensus Safety] When InvariantViolation errors occur during consensus configuration loading, are they properly propagated to halt the validator, or can they be suppressed allowing Byzantine validators to operate with violated safety invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: InvariantViolation] [State Corruption] Can InvariantViolation errors in Move VM native implementations be caught and ignored, allowing execution to continue with corrupted state that violates resource safety or causes non-deterministic execution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: IO] [Path Traversal] Does the IO error variant expose filesystem paths in error messages that could reveal sensitive directory structures, private keys locations, or genesis file paths to attackers with access to logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: IO] [Configuration Tampering] If IO errors occur when loading critical safety rules or consensus configurations, are these errors handled atomically to prevent partial configuration loads that could leave validators in inconsistent security states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: BCS] [Deserialization Attack] Can maliciously crafted BCS-encoded configuration data trigger BCS deserialization errors that are caught and defaulted to insecure fallback configurations instead of halting node startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: BCS] [State Consistency] When BCS deserialization errors occur during genesis transaction processing or on-chain config reads, can this cause validators to have divergent chain state leading to consensus failures or network partitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Yaml] [Configuration Injection] Does the Yaml error variant properly sanitize error messages containing user-supplied YAML content, or can attackers inject malicious strings into logs that could exploit log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Yaml] [Mainnet Safety] If YAML parsing errors are ignored or default to permissive configurations, can this allow mainnet validators to start with test configurations, in-memory storage, or disabled security features? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Missing] [Default Values] When Missing errors occur for critical security configuration fields (e.g., validator keys, safety rules backend), are secure-by-default values enforced, or can nodes start with dangerous null/empty configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Missing] [Consensus Participation] Can Missing configuration errors for validator network settings allow nodes to inadvertently join consensus without proper mutual authentication or with incorrect network IDs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Unexpected] [Error Propagation] Does the Unexpected variant properly preserve error context when converting from anyhow::Error, or is critical security information lost during error conversion that could mask underlying attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Impl: From<anyhow::Error>] [Error Swallowing] Can the From implementation for anyhow::Error inadvertently convert critical security errors into generic Unexpected errors, causing proper error handling logic to be bypassed in security-critical code paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: config_sanitizer.rs] [Sanitization Bypass] When ConfigSanitizerFailed errors are returned from consensus config sanitization, can race conditions allow the node config to be modified after sanitization passes but before the node starts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: config_sanitizer.rs] [Failpoint Exposure] If failpoint configuration sanitization returns errors that are logged but not fatal, can attackers enable failpoints on mainnet nodes by exploiting error handling gaps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: safety_rules_config.rs] [Safety Rules Bypass] When safety rules configuration generates ConfigSanitizerFailed errors for in-memory backends on mainnet, are these errors guaranteed to prevent node startup, or can error handling race conditions allow temporary startup? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: safety_rules_config.rs] [Validator Security] If InvariantViolation errors occur while loading validator private keys or safety rules state, can partial key material be cached in memory before the error, creating a side-channel vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: consensus_config.rs] [Consensus Parameter Tampering] Can IO or YAML errors during consensus config loading cause nodes to fall back to default consensus parameters that differ from the network's configured values, leading to consensus disagreements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: storage_config.rs] [Data Loss] When storage configuration sanitization fails with ConfigSanitizerFailed, can this lead to nodes starting with incorrect pruning settings that permanently delete required historical state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: execution_config.rs] [VM Safety] If execution configuration errors are suppressed, can validators start with disabled paranoid_hot_potato_verification or other critical Move VM safety checks on mainnet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: node_config_loader.rs] [Genesis Validation] When InvariantViolation errors occur during genesis transaction ChainId extraction, can nodes start without proper chain ID validation, potentially participating in the wrong network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Usage: network_config.rs] [Network Security] Can InvariantViolation errors in validator network configuration cause nodes to start without mutual authentication, allowing unauthorized nodes to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Display] [Sensitive Data Leakage] Do error messages from ConfigSanitizerFailed, IO, or Yaml variants include sensitive configuration values (private keys, API tokens, internal IPs) that could be logged to insecure locations? (High)"
