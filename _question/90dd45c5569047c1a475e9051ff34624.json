  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Error Propagation] Does the Result type properly propagate parsing errors with descriptive messages, or can error chaining hide the root cause of nibble path parsing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Case Sensitivity] Does parse_nibble_path() accept both uppercase and lowercase hex characters (A-F vs a-f), or can case mismatches cause valid paths to be rejected breaking debugger functionality? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Whitespace Handling] Can whitespace characters in the input string cause nibble path parsing to fail silently, or are they properly trimmed before hex conversion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Nibble Overflow] When Nibble::from() receives values >= 16 from incorrect parsing, does it panic or silently wrap around, potentially causing wrong Merkle tree navigation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Constant: PAGE_SIZE] [Integer Overflow] Is PAGE_SIZE = 10 used in arithmetic operations that could overflow when multiplied with large page numbers, causing incorrect pagination or out-of-bounds array access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Constant: PAGE_SIZE] [DoS via Pagination] Can an attacker request extremely high page numbers that, when multiplied by PAGE_SIZE, cause memory exhaustion or integer overflow in pagination logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Constant: PAGE_SIZE] [Off-by-One] Are there off-by-one errors in pagination logic using PAGE_SIZE that could cause the last item on a page to be missed or the first item on the next page to be duplicated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Functions: open_state_merkle_db() + open_state_kv_db()] [Database Consistency] Can opening StateKvDb and StateMerkleDb with different sharding_config values cause state inconsistencies where key-value data doesn't match Merkle proofs?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Readonly Enforcement] Are readonly=true flags consistently enforced across all database opens, or can write operations slip through causing unintended state modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Error Recovery] If any database open operation fails midway, are all previously opened databases properly closed to prevent resource leaks and file lock deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Functions: All open_*_db()] [Atomic Operations] Are the database opening operations atomic, or can partial failures leave databases in inconsistent states where some components are open and others are not? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: ShardingConfig] [Configuration Tampering] Can an attacker modify the enable_storage_sharding flag after DbDir is constructed but before databases are opened, bypassing sharding enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Functions: All] [Thread Safety] Are all functions in this module thread-safe, or can concurrent debugger operations cause race conditions in shared database access? (High)",
