  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 58-59] [Comment Mismatch] The comment states exports are 'just for the test-context crate' but no #[doc(hidden)] or crate-level visibility restrictions exist - is this a documentation bug or actual security exposure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 31-56] [API Tags Documentation] Does the ApiTags enum documentation (lines 34-55) accurately reflect security guarantees, or could 'Experimental' or 'General' tags be misused to expose privileged operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 14, 61] [Error Converter] Is the 'error_converter' module (line 14) properly sanitizing errors before exposing them through BasicError (line 61), or could stack traces, internal paths, or database errors leak to attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 61] [BasicError Public] Since BasicError is publicly exported (line 61), can external code construct custom error responses that bypass rate limiting, logging, or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 29] [View Function Module] Does the 'view_function' module (line 29) properly sandbox Move VM execution for read-only calls, or can malicious view functions cause state modifications, resource exhaustion, or consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 29, 54-55] [View Function Tag] Does the 'View' ApiTag (lines 54-55) guarantee read-only access, or could view function endpoints be exploited to trigger state-changing operations through reentrancy or callback attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 20] [Page Module] Does the 'page' module (line 20) properly validate pagination parameters to prevent integer overflow, cursor injection, or unbounded result sets that could DoS the API server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 21] [Response Module] Does the 'response' module (line 21) enforce consistent serialization formats (JSON/BCS) across all endpoints to prevent format confusion attacks or data type coercion vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 12] [Check Size Module] Is the 'check_size' module (line 12) applied consistently across all endpoints, or can certain routes bypass content-length checks and accept oversized payloads for DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 10] [BCS Payload] Does the 'bcs_payload' module (line 10) properly validate BCS deserialization to prevent malformed binary data from causing panics, memory corruption, or consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 7] [Accept Type Module] Can the 'accept_type' module (line 7) be exploited through malformed Accept headers to bypass response validation, cause format confusion, or trigger different code paths with security implications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 15] [Events Module] Does the 'events' module (line 15) properly filter sensitive events (validator set changes, stake movements) to prevent information leakage that aids in consensus attacks or validator identification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 25] [State Module] Can the 'state' module (line 25) be abused to query arbitrary state keys, bypassing access controls on system resources, validator configurations, or cryptographic keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 18] [Log Module] Is the 'log' module (line 18) properly capturing all API access for security monitoring, or can certain endpoints bypass logging to hide attack attempts or unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/lib.rs] [Line: 17] [Index Module] Does the 'index' module (line 17) provide a root endpoint that lists all available APIs, and could this information disclosure aid attackers in discovering unpatched or experimental endpoints? (Low)"
