  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: into_coverage_map_with_modules()] [Data Loss] The filter_map operation silently drops coverage data for modules not present in the provided modules map - could this hide important coverage information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: ExecCoverageMapWithModules::merge()] [Module Replacement] The or_insert() pattern can replace existing compiled_modules with different ones - could this cause inconsistencies if the same module path points to different compiled modules? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Error Propagation] When File::open() fails, the error is wrapped but the context (filename) is included - could this leak sensitive path information in error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Silent Failure] The ok() calls on lines 110, 316-317 silently convert errors to None - could important file access errors be hidden from the caller? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Error Message Clarity] The generic error message 'Error while reading in coverage map binary' doesn't distinguish between 'file not found', 'permission denied', or 'read failure' - could this hinder debugging of actual attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Struct: CoverageMap] [Race Condition] The CoverageMap structure contains mutable BTreeMaps but no synchronization primitives - if accessed concurrently from multiple threads, could race conditions corrupt the coverage data? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: insert()] [Non-Atomic Updates] The cascading entry().or_insert_with() pattern creates multiple intermediate states - in concurrent scenarios, could partial updates lead to inconsistent map structures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: merge()] [Concurrent Modification] If merge() is called while another thread is reading the coverage map, could this cause data races or panics from concurrent BTreeMap modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Unwrap Abuse] Multiple .unwrap() calls (lines 74-76, 80-84, 87-88) could panic on malformed input - should these use proper error handling with Result types instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Assert in Production] The assert_eq! macros on lines 87-88 will panic in production code if the script format is unexpected - should this be graceful error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: TraceMap::update_from_trace_file()] [Code Duplication] The trace file parsing logic is nearly identical to CoverageMap's version - could bugs be introduced when updating one but not the other? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: TraceMap::insert()] [Unsafe Cast] The 'pc as CodeOffset' cast on line 337 could truncate values if pc > u16::MAX (CodeOffset is likely u16) - can this cause incorrect trace entries? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Type: FunctionCoverage] [Key Collision] Using u64 as the key in BTreeMap<u64, u64> for program counters - could extremely large pc values cause collisions or overflow issues in BTreeMap operations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [CSV Injection] If trace file contents are later exported to CSV format, could malicious function names containing formulas (=cmd|...) lead to CSV injection attacks in spreadsheet applications? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Zip Bomb] Could an attacker provide a compressed BCS-serialized coverage map that expands to gigabytes when deserialized, similar to a zip bomb attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: output_map_to_file()] [Disk Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause extremely large coverage maps to be serialized, filling up disk space when write_all() is called? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Regex DoS] While not directly using regex, the split() operations on attacker-controlled input - could pathological input patterns cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: merge()] [Coverage Data Corruption] The extend() operation in merge() could overwrite existing coverage data - if coverage from two different test runs is merged, could this hide code that wasn't actually covered? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: to_unified_exec_map()] [ID Loss] The unified map has an empty exec_id (String::new()) - does losing execution ID information make it impossible to trace coverage back to specific test runs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: into_coverage_map_with_modules()] [Mismatched Modules] If the provided modules map contains different versions of modules than what was actually executed, could this create false coverage reports? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Empty File] What happens if the trace file is empty or contains only whitespace? Does the function handle this gracefully or could it cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Zero PC] Is pc=0 a valid program counter value? Could traces with pc=0 be used to hide coverage or create confusion in reports? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Empty Binary] If the binary file is empty (0 bytes), does bcs::from_bytes() handle this gracefully or could it cause a panic or unexpected deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: insert_multi()] [Zero Count] If count=0 is passed to insert_multi(), should this be a no-op, or does incrementing by 0 have semantic meaning that could affect coverage analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: output_map_to_file()] [Empty Map] Does serializing an empty CoverageMap (no exec_maps entries) create a valid but minimal binary file, or could this cause issues in downstream tools? (Low)"
