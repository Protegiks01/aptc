  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator.rs] [All functions] [Read-write conflicts] Can BlockSTM's conflict detection miss read-write conflicts on aggregator values if the aggregator is accessed through multiple indirection layers (Table -> Aggregator -> internal state)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator.rs] [All functions] [Module upgrade race] If the aggregator_test module is upgraded while transactions are in flight, can new() transactions use the old module but add() transactions use the new module, causing interface mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator.rs] [Function: initialize()] [Framework dependency] The code depends on aptos_framework::aggregator - can version mismatches between the test framework and production framework cause different behavior in parallel vs sequential execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator.rs] [All functions] [Type parameter injection] Even though type arguments are empty (vec![]), can attackers craft transactions that inject type parameters at the Move VM level, causing type confusion in aggregator operations? (High)"
