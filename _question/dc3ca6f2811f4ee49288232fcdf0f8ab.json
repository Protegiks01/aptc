  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Column Family Isolation] Does the STATE_VALUE_CF_NAME constant uniquely identify this schema's column family, or can naming collisions with other schemas cause state values to be written to wrong column families, mixing validator state with transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Type Safety] The schema defines Key = (StateKey, Version) and Value = Option<StateValue> - can type confusion between this and other schemas (like StateValueByKeyHashSchema) cause wrong data to be read as state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Macro: define_schema!] [Trait Implementations] Does the define_schema! macro correctly implement all required Schema traits (KeyCodec, ValueCodec, SeekKeyCodec), or can missing implementations cause runtime panics during database operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Atomicity] Does the schema guarantee that encode/decode operations are atomic with respect to database reads/writes, or can torn reads/writes during concurrent access cause validators to see partial state updates mid-transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Determinism] Are all encoding operations (encode_key, encode_value, encode_seek_key) deterministic across all platforms, Rust versions, and hardware architectures, or can non-determinism cause validators to produce different Merkle roots and fork the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Version Ordering Invariant] The schema relies on bit-flipping version to achieve descending order - is this invariant properly maintained everywhere, or can operations that bypass the schema (direct RocksDB access) break version ordering and corrupt historical state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Merkle Tree Consistency] Since this schema stores the actual state values used to compute Merkle tree hashes, can inconsistencies between stored values and Merkle nodes cause state proofs to fail verification, breaking light client security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Garbage Collection] When state values are deleted (tombstoned with None), does the schema support proper cleanup, or can deleted state accumulate indefinitely causing storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Key Uniqueness] Is the combination of (StateKey, Version) guaranteed to be globally unique across all state types (resources, modules, table items), or can key collisions occur between different state categories? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Error Recovery] If encode/decode operations fail mid-execution (panic, OOM, disk full), can the database enter an inconsistent state that requires manual intervention to recover? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Pruning Safety] When historical versions are pruned, does the schema ensure that the latest version for each StateKey is never pruned, or can pruning errors cause loss of current state and validator divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Migration Safety] If the schema definition changes in a protocol upgrade, can old encoded data be decoded by the new schema, or will migration failures cause validators to halt at the upgrade boundary? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Overall Design] [Concurrent Access] Does RocksDB's column family locking provide sufficient isolation for this schema, or can concurrent reads during writes expose partial state updates that violate transaction atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [StateKey Integration] [AccessPath Encoding] StateKey contains AccessPath with address + path - can path components with special characters cause encode_key() to produce keys that conflict with TableItem or Raw state keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [StateKey Integration] [TableItem Key Length] StateKey::TableItem includes variable-length key bytes - can extremely long table keys (megabytes) cause encode_key() memory exhaustion or exceed RocksDB key size limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [StateKey Integration] [Raw Bytes Injection] StateKey::Raw allows arbitrary bytes - can an attacker inject raw bytes that mimic the encoded format of AccessPath or TableItem keys, causing state key type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [StateKey Integration] [State Key Tag Validation] Does decode_key() validate that the decoded StateKey has the correct tag (AccessPath/TableItem/Raw), or can corrupted databases cause tag mismatches that break Move VM execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [StateKey Integration] [Registry Cache Poisoning] StateKey uses a TwoKeyRegistry for caching - can cached entries with wrong encoded forms poison the schema's encode_key() and cause non-deterministic key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Version Boundaries] [Version 0 Special Case] At version 0, the bit-flip produces u64::MAX - can this cause off-by-one errors in version comparison logic that reads the wrong version's state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Version Boundaries] [Version MAX Overflow] If a state key is updated at version u64::MAX, does bit-flipping to 0 cause the encoded key to collide with genesis state at version 0, enabling time-travel attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Version Boundaries] [Negative Version Interpretation] Can the bit-flipped version be misinterpreted as a signed integer in some contexts, causing versions to appear negative and breaking version ordering invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Version Boundaries] [Iterator Edge Cases] When iterating through versions in reverse order (due to bit-flip), can the iterator skip version 0 or u64::MAX, causing incomplete state history queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [BCS Attacks] [Length Prefix Manipulation] BCS uses length prefixes for variable-length data - can an attacker craft StateValues with manipulated length prefixes that cause deserialization to read past buffer boundaries and leak memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [BCS Attacks] [Enum Discriminant Injection] Option<StateValue> is an enum with discriminants - can corrupted databases inject invalid discriminant values that cause undefined behavior during decode_value()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [BCS Attacks] [Recursive Type DoS] If StateValue contains nested structures, can deeply nested BCS encoding cause stack overflow during encode_value() or decode_value()? (High)"
