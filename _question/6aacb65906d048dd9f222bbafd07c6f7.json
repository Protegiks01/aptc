  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Information Disclosure] Does the NotFound(String) variant at line 14-15 expose sensitive internal database structure or key information that could help an attacker map the storage layout and plan targeted attacks on specific state items? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [DoS/Resource Exhaustion] Can the TooManyRequested error at lines 17-18 be bypassed by splitting large requests into multiple smaller requests that individually pass validation but collectively exhaust storage resources, causing validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [State Corruption] When MissingRootError is returned at line 19-20 for a pruned state root, could incorrect handling of this error lead validators to diverge on state root commitments, causing consensus failure and potential chain split? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Error Masking] Does the generic Other(String) variant at lines 22-23 mask critical storage failures (disk corruption, merkle tree inconsistencies) that should halt consensus but instead allow validators to continue with corrupted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Consensus Divergence] Can the RocksDbIncompleteResult error at lines 24-25 occur non-deterministically across validators during concurrent reads, causing some validators to see incomplete data while others succeed, leading to state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Data Loss] Does OtherRocksDbError at lines 26-27 properly distinguish between recoverable errors (temporary I/O issues) and unrecoverable corruption, or could it allow validators to proceed with partially corrupted database state? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Transaction Replay] If BcsError occurs during transaction deserialization at lines 28-29, could an attacker craft malformed transactions that deserialize differently across validators, causing some to execute and others to reject, breaking deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Liveness Attack] Can IoError at lines 30-31 be triggered by filling disk space with crafted storage requests, causing persistent write failures that halt block commits and freeze the blockchain? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Consensus Stall] Does RecvError at lines 32-33 in inter-thread communication properly trigger node recovery, or can it cause silent failures in storage commit pipeline leading to validators being unable to commit blocks? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosDbError] [Integer Overflow] Can ParseIntError at lines 34-35 occur when parsing version numbers from storage, potentially causing validators to read wrong historical state versions and produce incorrect state roots? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for anyhow::Error] [Error Context Loss] Does converting anyhow::Error to Other(String) at lines 38-42 lose critical error context and stack traces needed to diagnose consensus failures, potentially masking Byzantine validator attacks?

  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for anyhow::Error] [State Corruption] If anyhow errors from merkle tree operations are converted to generic Other errors, could this mask critical tree corruption that should trigger emergency halt, allowing invalid state roots to propagate?

(High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for bcs::Error] [Transaction Validation Bypass] Can malformed BCS encoding in transaction payloads trigger bcs::Error that gets converted to AptosDbError, allowing attacker to craft transactions that some validators accept while others reject?

  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for bcs::Error] [State Proof Forgery] If BCS deserialization errors occur when verifying merkle proofs, does the conversion at line 46 properly propagate cryptographic verification failure, or could it mask proof forgery attempts?

(Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for RecvError] [Race Condition] Can RecvError occur due to race conditions between storage reader and writer threads, causing non-deterministic errors that affect only some validators and break state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for RecvError] [Resource Cleanup] Does the conversion at line 52 ensure proper cleanup of channel resources, or could repeated RecvErrors cause thread handle leaks that eventually exhaust validator memory? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: from() for ParseIntError] [Error Type Inconsistency] Why does ParseIntError convert to Other instead of ParseIntError variant at lines 62-66, and could this inconsistency cause callers to miss integer parsing failures that should trigger specific error handling?
