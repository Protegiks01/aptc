  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Memory: Copy Operations] [Memory Safety] Do all copy_from_slice() operations verify source and destination sizes match, or can size mismatches cause buffer overflows? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Memory: Buffer Allocation] [Stack Overflow] Are the fixed-size buffers (CLIENT_MESSAGE_SIZE, SERVER_MESSAGE_SIZE) allocated on the stack, potentially causing stack overflow for large messages? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Validation: Timestamp] [Range Validation] Are timestamps validated to be within a reasonable range (not too far in future/past), or can extreme values cause integer overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Validation: Frame Length] [Size Limits] Is the frame_len validated against MAX_SIZE_NOISE_MSG before allocating/reading, or can an attacker cause excessive memory allocation? (High)",
