  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Memory Safety] [TriompheArc Cycle] Can circular references be created through TriompheArc<MoveTypeLayout> cloning that prevent proper memory deallocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Memory Safety] [Large Layout DoS] Can attackers provide MoveTypeLayouts with deeply nested or recursive structures that cause exponential memory growth during clone operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Transaction Ordering] [Dependency Bypass] Can attackers structure transactions to avoid having their delayed field dependencies detected by does_value_need_exchange(), allowing non-serializable execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Transaction Ordering] [Read-After-Write Violation] Does ReadPosition::AfterCurrentTxn ensure proper read-after-write ordering, or can transactions read stale values from before concurrent writes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Transaction Ordering] [Write-Write Conflict] If multiple concurrent transactions write to the same delayed field ID, does the versioned_map properly detect conflicts and trigger re-execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Aggregator V2] [Lifted Value Cache Poisoning] Can malicious transactions poison the aggregator value cache in LatestView, causing future transactions to read corrupted aggregator values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Aggregator V2] [Identifier Replacement Attack] Since values are replaced with identifiers at deserialization time, can attackers exploit timing between replacement and actual use to cause confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Aggregator V2] [Delayed Field Overflow] Can aggregator operations cause delayed field values to overflow their width constraints, corrupting the base_value stored in set_delayed_field_value()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Testing] [Fail Point Production Leak] Are fail_point macros completely removed in production builds, or can test code paths be triggered in production allowing bypass of real validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [Testing] [Mock Serialization Bypass] Can the mock_layout() and deserialize_to_delayed_field_id() test helpers be exploited if cfg(test) features leak into production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [State Isolation] [Cross-Transaction ID Leak] Can delayed field IDs created by one transaction be accessed or modified by another transaction through the shared LatestView reference? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [State Isolation] [HashSet Pollution] If TemporaryValueToIdentifierMapping is reused across transactions, can delayed_field_ids accumulate IDs from previous transactions causing false dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/value_exchange.rs] [State Isolation] [View State Contamination] Can state modifications in ViewState::Sync mode leak into ViewState::Unsync mode or vice versa, causing execution inconsistencies? (Critical)"
