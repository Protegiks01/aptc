  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Race Condition] Lines 281-291 handle proposal_rx and 293-326 handle proof_rx using tokio::select! - can messages arrive in unexpected orders causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Shutdown Attack] Lines 296-301 handle Shutdown command by sending ack and breaking - if shutdown is triggered during critical state updates, can this leave batch_proof_queue in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Channel Exhaustion] If proof_rx receives thousands of ProofManagerCommand messages faster than they can be processed, can the channel buffer overflow and cause message loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Back Pressure Propagation Failure] Lines 288-290 and 322-324 send back_pressure updates but only log errors if send fails - if back_pressure_tx receiver is dropped, will batch generation continue without back pressure feedback? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Deadlock Risk] Lines 273-276 initialize back_pressure state - if both proposal_rx and proof_rx block waiting for messages while back_pressure_tx blocks waiting to send, can this cause deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [ProofOfStoreMsg Unpacking] Line 305 calls proofs.take() to extract Vec<ProofOfStore> from ProofOfStoreMsg - what validation ensures this message is well-formed and not corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Message Ordering] Are ProofManagerCommand messages processed in FIFO order, or can reordering cause batches to be received before their proofs, leading to incomplete state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Timer Overhead] Line 279 starts a timer for PROOF_MANAGER_MAIN_LOOP - can timing measurements themselves become overhead under high load, affecting consensus latency? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Metric Increment Only] Lines 297, 304, 308, 312 increment QUORUM_STORE_MSG_COUNT metrics but don't enforce rate limits - can this metric overflow or be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Enum: ProofManagerCommand] [Command Injection] Can malicious code construct ProofManagerCommand::ReceiveProofs with arbitrary ProofOfStoreMsg data that bypasses normal network validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Enum: ProofManagerCommand] [Batch/Proof Desync] If ReceiveBatches and ReceiveProofs commands arrive out of order, can this cause batches without proofs or proofs without batches to accumulate? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Enum: ProofManagerCommand] [Commit Timestamp Attack] Can CommitNotification be sent with a block_timestamp that doesn't correspond to an actual committed block, manipulating batch expiration logic? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Struct: ProofManager] [State Drift] Are remaining_total_txn_num and remaining_total_proof_num kept in sync with batch_proof_queue's actual state, or can updates be missed causing drift? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Struct: ProofManager] [Concurrent Access] Since ProofManager is used in async context, is batch_proof_queue wrapped in Arc<Mutex> or similar, and can this cause contention or deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Struct: ProofManager] [Flag Consistency] Can allow_batches_without_pos_in_proposal and enable_payload_v2 flags be modified during runtime by governance, and would such changes cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Race Condition] Can receive_proofs() insert a proof while handle_proposal_request() is pulling proofs, causing the newly inserted proof to be included in a proposal without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Race Condition] If handle_commit_notification() marks batches as committed while handle_proposal_request() is pulling those same batches, can this cause committed batches to be included in new proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Race Condition] Can concurrent receive_batches() and handle_commit_notification() calls cause newly inserted batches to be immediately marked as committed without ever being proposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Race Condition] If multiple handle_proposal_request() calls occur concurrently (multiple proposers), can they pull overlapping batches leading to the same transactions in multiple blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Integer Overflow] In handle_proposal_request() line 154, if txns_with_proof_size and opt_batch_txns_size are both close to u64::MAX, can their addition overflow the PayloadTxnsSize type? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Integer Overflow] Line 161 uses min() on count values - if max_inline_txns_to_pull.count() or the saturating_sub result overflows, can this bypass transaction limits? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Integer Underflow] Lines 158-160 use saturating_sub() which returns 0 on underflow - can this cause max_inline_txns_to_pull to be 0 when it should have a valid value, preventing inline batches from being pulled? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Type Conversion] PayloadTxnsSize appears to have both count and bytes dimensions - can mismatches between these dimensions be exploited to bypass limits? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Timestamp Manipulation] If block_timestamp in handle_commit_notification() is set to 0, can this cause all batches to appear unexpired regardless of their actual expiration time? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can a malicious proposer set request.block_timestamp in handle_proposal_request() to a value far in the past, including expired batches that should have been filtered? (High)"
