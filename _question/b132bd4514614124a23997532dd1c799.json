  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Struct: li_digest_to_votes] [HashMap DoS] At lines 44-45, HashMap uses HashValue keys. Can attackers exploit hash collision attacks specific to the HashValue type to create O(n) lookup times, degrading consensus performance to halt the network? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Function: insert_order_vote()] [Entry API race] At line 72, entry() is called on HashMap. If multiple threads call entry() for the same key simultaneously without external synchronization, can Rust's borrow checker be bypassed, causing undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Function: insert_order_vote()] [HashMap rehashing] As li_digest_to_votes grows, HashMap rehashing occurs. Can attackers trigger rehashing during critical consensus moments by flooding with votes, causing latency spikes that prevent timely quorum formation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Function: garbage_collect()] [Retain predicate side effects] At line 163, retain() is called with a closure that accesses status. Can the closure have side effects or panics that leave the HashMap in a partially modified state, corrupting vote tracking? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Struct: PendingOrderVotes] [HashMap key ownership] At lines 44-45, HashValue is used as a key type. Can attackers exploit situations where HashValue keys are shared between multiple contexts, causing use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Function: insert_order_vote()] [Coordinated Byzantine attack] Can < 1/3 Byzantine validators coordinate to submit votes that individually pass validation at lines 94-154 but collectively form an invalid QC that violates consensus safety properties? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pending_order_votes.rs] [Function: insert_order_vote()] [Equivocation enablement] The code doesn't explicitly check for equivocation (same author voting for different ledger infos). Can Byzantine validators exploit this to vote for multiple conflicting blocks, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)"
