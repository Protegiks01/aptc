(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: LedgerPrunerConfig] [Prune Window Underflow] Can prune_window be set to 0 or 1 at line 306, causing aggressive pruning that deletes data still needed by in-flight transactions or state sync operations, leading to state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: LedgerPrunerConfig] [Batch Size Attack] Can batch_size be set to usize::MAX at line 310, causing the pruner to attempt pruning all historical data in a single batch, triggering memory exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: LedgerPrunerConfig] [User Pruning Offset Manipulation] Can user_pruning_window_offset at line 312 be manipulated to exceed prune_window, causing the API to refuse all historical queries and breaking archive node functionality?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: EpochSnapshotPrunerConfig] [State Sync Dependency] If epoch_snapshot_pruner_config is disabled while state sync relies on epoch snapshots, can this cause new nodes joining the network to fail synchronization, harming network decentralization?
