  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/jellyfish_merkle_node/mod.rs] [Schema] [Disk corruption detection] Can the schema detect disk-level corruption in encoded keys/values, or will corrupted bytes propagate as valid nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/jellyfish_merkle_node/mod.rs] [KeyCodec trait] [Trait implementation safety] Can a malicious KeyCodec implementation be injected for NodeKey that bypasses schema validation, encoding arbitrary database keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/jellyfish_merkle_node/mod.rs] [ValueCodec trait] [Trait implementation safety] Can a malicious ValueCodec implementation for Node serialize invalid state that bypasses all schema validation checks? (Critical)",
