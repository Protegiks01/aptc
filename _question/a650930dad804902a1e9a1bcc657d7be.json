  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Struct: Errmap] [Default Path Injection] The default output_file is 'error_map' - can this collide with existing files in common project structures, causing unintended overwrites of user data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Default Prefix Bypass] When error_prefix is None, does ErrmapOptions::default() use a secure default, or can this be exploited to bypass error filtering and expose all constants as errors? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Extension Confusion] Can with_extension() be exploited with output_file names containing multiple dots (e.g., 'file.tar.gz') to produce unexpected extensions that bypass security policies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Component Injection] Does PathBuf handling properly sanitize path components, or can special characters in output_file (e.g., ':', '\\\\') cause platform-specific vulnerabilities? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Umask Bypass] Does save_result() respect system umask settings, or can it create error map files with overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable) that leak sensitive error information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Capability Leakage] Can error map files inherit dangerous capabilities from the CLI process, making them exploitable for privilege escalation in containerized environments? (Low)",
