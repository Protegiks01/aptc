  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/fat_loop.rs] [Struct: LoopUnrollingMark] [Iteration Bounds] Can iter_count values exceeding reasonable limits (e.g., >1000) cause exponential blowup in unrolled bytecode size? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/fat_loop.rs] [Function: probe_loop_unrolling_mark()] [Count Validation] The count from loop_unrolling map (line 343) is not validated - can zero or negative counts (if represented differently) cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/fat_loop.rs] [Function: collect_loop_body_bytecode()] [Range Validity] The range *lower..=*upper at line 465 - can lower > upper cause empty ranges or panics? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/fat_loop.rs] [Function: collect_loop_body_bytecode()] [Property Access] get_label_inner_opt() is called at lines 462, 483 - can None results cause logic errors in fallthrough handling? (Medium)",
