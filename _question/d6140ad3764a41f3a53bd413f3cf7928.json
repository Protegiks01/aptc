(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Function: aptos_test_root_address()] [Signer Acquisition Exploit] Can an attacker exploit Move functions like get_signer_testnet_only() that grant signers for aptos_test_root_address() if mainnet incorrectly enables these functions, allowing arbitrary privileged operations?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Function: reserved_vm_address()] [VM Impersonation Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions that impersonate the reserved VM address (0x0) to bypass system_addresses::assert_vm() checks in Move contracts, executing privileged block prologue or system operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Function: reserved_vm_address()] [Zero Address Collision] Does the zero address (all zeros) used by reserved_vm_address() have special handling to prevent user accounts from being created at this address, or can attackers create accounts there to bypass VM checks? (Critical)",
