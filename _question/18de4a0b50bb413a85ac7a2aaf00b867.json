  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Indexer Processing] [Event Filtering] Can attackers emit fake events matching the BurnEvent structure from non-TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS locations to pollute indexer databases with false burn records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Indexer Processing] [Missing Validation] Do indexers validate that the token address in BurnEvent actually corresponds to a token object that existed, or can fake burns of never-minted tokens corrupt supply statistics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Protocol Upgrade] [Breaking Changes] If BurnEvent struct layout changes in a future upgrade, will this break backward compatibility with historical events stored on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Protocol Upgrade] [Migration Path] During transition from BurnEvent to new Burn event type, can inconsistent handling cause some burns to not be reflected in either event stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Economic Attack] [Artificial Scarcity] Can malicious collection owners emit BurnEvents for tokens they don't actually destroy, creating false scarcity to manipulate token prices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Economic Attack] [Supply Manipulation] Can attackers who compromise the collection owner's account emit mass BurnEvents to crash the collection's supply value and profit from short positions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Rust Safety] [Unsafe Blocks] If downstream code uses unsafe blocks to process BurnEvent data, can invalid index or token values violate memory safety invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Rust Safety] [Panic Safety] If processing BurnEvent in collection.move panics after supply is decremented but before event emission, can this leave inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Dependency] [BCS Library] Are there known vulnerabilities in the bcs crate version used for try_from_bytes() that could enable deserialization exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Bridge Security] [Burn Verification] If BurnEvents are used for bridge protocols to prove tokens were destroyed on Aptos, can fake events enable unlimited minting on destination chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Bridge Security] [Replay Across Chains] Can BurnEvents from testnet be replayed on mainnet to falsely prove burns and mint bridged tokens without actual destruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Governance] [Emergency Stop] Can governance freeze token burning by blocking BurnEvent emission, potentially trapping users' funds in burned tokens that can't be cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Governance] [Feature Flag] If module_event_migration_enabled() flag is manipulated during governance attacks, can this cause BurnEvents to be emitted to wrong event streams or not at all? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Test Coverage] [Edge Case Testing] Are there sufficient tests for BurnEvent with boundary values (0, MAX_U64) and invalid addresses to ensure robust validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_event.rs] [Test Coverage] [Concurrency Testing] Have race conditions between concurrent BurnEvent emissions to the same EventHandle been thoroughly tested to prevent corruption? (Medium)"
