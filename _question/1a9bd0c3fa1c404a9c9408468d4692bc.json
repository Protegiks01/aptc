  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/values/value_tests.rs] [General] [Rc<RefCell<>> safety] Throughout the file, values use Rc<RefCell<>> for interior mutability - can attackers trigger RefCell borrow panics by creating nested borrows, causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/values/value_tests.rs] [General] [Gas metering gaps] The tests don't verify gas charges - can attackers exploit expensive value operations (deep struct nesting, large vectors) to perform computation without paying proportional gas? (High)",
