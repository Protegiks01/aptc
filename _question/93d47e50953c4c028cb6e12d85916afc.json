Can the Result error path be exploited to cause inconsistent error handling across validators? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 35] [VecDeque Value Types] The args VecDeque contains Value enums. Is there validation that these Values are actually u64 types before safely_pop_arg! casts them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 41-70] [BLS12-381 Structure Mixing] Can an attacker create a transaction that compares elements from different BLS12-381 structures (e.g., Fr vs G1) by manipulating the handles to point to wrong structure types, bypassing Move's type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 71-98] [BN254 Structure Mixing] Similarly, can BN254 structures (Fr, Fq, Fq12, G1, G2, Gt) be mixed in comparisons by exploiting handle reuse across different structure types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 41-98] [Cross-Curve Comparison] Can handles from BLS12-381 elements be compared with BN254 elements by exploiting the handle-based indirection, potentially breaking cryptographic protocol assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 47-52, 65-70] [Fq12/Gt Confusion] Since both Fq12 and Gt use the same underlying type (Fq12), can an attacker create an element as Gt but compare it with type argument BLS12381Fq12, bypassing pairing validation?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Macro: ark_eq_internal!, Line 27] [Non-Canonical Representation] If two validators compare elements with different internal representations (e.g., Montgomery form vs normal form for field elements) but consider them equal, can this cause different state roots in the Jellyfish Merkle tree? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/eq.rs] [Function: eq_internal, Line 28] [Boolean State Impact] The equality result is stored as a boolean Value.
