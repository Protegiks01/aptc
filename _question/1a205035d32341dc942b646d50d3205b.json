(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: OverrideNodeConfig::new()] [Malicious Base Config] Can an attacker provide a malicious base_config that contains backdoor values, which would then make malicious override values appear as 'no diff' and bypass detection?
