  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Function: uleb128_test()] [Missing negative value tests] While ULEB128 is unsigned, does the code properly handle sign extension if used in signed contexts, or could negative values be misinterpreted? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Function: check_vector()] [Assertion failure handling] The function uses assert! which panics on failure - in production, could panic during bytecode parsing crash validator nodes causing liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Test suite] [Missing performance tests] Are there tests for worst-case ULEB128 decoding time with maximum-length encodings, or could attackers craft bytecode that takes excessive time to parse, delaying block processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Function: uleb128_malformed_test()] [Partial read recovery] If read_u8 returns error mid-ULEB128, is the cursor position properly reset so subsequent parsing can recover, or does it leave cursor in inconsistent state?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Function: uleb128_roundtrip()] [Serialization idempotency] Does the test verify that serializing twice produces identical results, or could state mutations in serializer cause second serialization to differ? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Move type system] [Type tag encoding] Move type tags are ULEB128-encoded - could incorrect decoding cause type confusion where value of one type is interpreted as another, breaking Move's resource safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Move type system] [Ability set corruption] Type abilities are bit flags potentially encoded as ULEB128 - could decoding errors grant abilities like 'copy' or 'drop' to resources that shouldn't have them, enabling resource duplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Move type system] [Generic parameter overflow] Generic type parameter counts use ULEB128 - could overflow allow types with more parameters than supported, breaking type checker assumptions and causing memory corruption?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Testing file_format_common] [Missing bounds on write operations] Does write_u64_as_uleb128 have a maximum output size check to prevent writing arbitrarily large buffers if the input value encoding logic has a bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Testing file_format_common] [Cursor exhaustion] What happens when cursor reaches end of buffer during multi-byte integer read - is EOF handled gracefully or could it cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [Testing file_format_common] [Integer promotion bugs] When ULEB128 bytes are cast to u64, could sign extension or promotion bugs cause incorrect values for bytes with high bit set? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [System integration] [Bytecode size limits] Does the deserialization respect maximum bytecode size limits enforced elsewhere, or could it successfully parse oversized modules that later cause system failures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/unit_tests/number_tests.rs] [System integration] [Gas metering bypass] If ULEB128 decoding doesn't properly account for parsing costs, could attackers craft bytecode that takes significant CPU time to parse without paying gas? (High)",
