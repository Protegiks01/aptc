  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: OperatorConfigFileArgs::load()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious operator_config_file path that reads sensitive files outside intended directories through path traversal (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd'), potentially exposing validator private keys or system credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: OperatorConfigFileArgs::load()] [Deserialization Attack] Does the YAML deserialization via from_yaml() properly validate the structure, or can maliciously crafted YAML files trigger code execution, DoS, or memory corruption through YAML bombs or type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: OperatorConfigFileArgs::load()] [File Size Attack] Is there a maximum file size check before reading operator config files, or can an attacker provide a multi-gigabyte YAML file causing memory exhaustion and CLI crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorConsensusKeyArgs::get_consensus_public_key()] [Key Validation Bypass] If both consensus_public_key CLI argument and operator_config are provided with conflicting keys, which takes precedence, and can this be exploited to register validators with unintended or malicious consensus keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorConsensusKeyArgs::get_consensus_public_key()] [Invalid Key Acceptance] Does the BLS12-381 public key validation check for point-at-infinity, invalid curve points, or keys in small subgroups that could compromise consensus security or enable rogue key attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorConsensusKeyArgs::get_consensus_proof_of_possession()] [PoP Verification Bypass] Is the proof of possession actually verified cryptographically before use, or is it just passed through, allowing an attacker to register consensus keys they don't control and potentially causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorConsensusKeyArgs::get_consensus_proof_of_possession()] [Rogue Key Attack] Can an attacker provide a valid PoP for a maliciously crafted public key that's actually an aggregation of multiple keys, enabling rogue key attacks in BLS signature aggregation during consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorNetworkAddressesArgs::get_network_configs()] [Address Confusion] If validator_host is provided via CLI but validator_network_public_key comes from operator_config (or vice versa), can mismatched network configurations be created that cause network partition or connectivity issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorNetworkAddressesArgs::get_network_configs()] [Key Reuse] Does the code prevent using the same x25519 network key for both validator and fullnode addresses, which could enable man-in-the-middle attacks or network identity confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorNetworkAddressesArgs::get_network_configs()] [Partial Configuration Attack] What happens if only full_node_host is provided without full_node_network_public_key (or vice versa), and can this partial state be submitted on-chain causing validator configuration corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: GetStakePool::execute()] [Unbounded Resource Consumption] When fetching multiple stake pools (direct + staking contracts + vesting), is there a limit on the number of pools retrieved, or can an account with thousands of vesting contracts cause API timeout or memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pools()] [Error Handling Information Leak] When direct_stake_pool or staking_contract_pools return errors, are error messages properly sanitized, or could they leak sensitive internal state information about the blockchain or validator operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pools()] [Race Condition] If multiple stake pool queries happen simultaneously for the same owner during epoch transitions, can inconsistent data be returned where some pools show old epoch info and others show new epoch info? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: GetPerformance::execute()] [Array Index Out of Bounds] When accessing validator_performances.validators[validator_index], is validator_index properly bounds-checked, or can an invalid index from corrupted on-chain data cause a panic crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: GetPerformance::execute()] [Unwrap Panic] Line 394 uses .unwrap() on get_account_events() result - can this panic if the events don't exist, causing CLI crash and potential DoS for monitoring tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: GetPerformance::execute()] [Data Extraction Vulnerability] Lines 398-404 extract rewards_amount from event data using unwrap() - can malformed event data or missing fields cause panic, and could malicious events be crafted to crash performance monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: GetPerformance::execute()] [Type Confusion] Does the code verify that the 'rewards_amount' field is actually a string representing a valid u64, or can type confusion occur if on-chain events have malformed data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_staking_contract_pools()] [Unwrap on Nested Data] Line 510 uses .unwrap() when getting stake pool info - can this crash if any staking contract has corrupted pool data, affecting all subsequent pool retrieval? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_staking_contract_pools()] [Infinite Loop Potential] Is there validation that staking_contracts vector doesn't contain circular references or duplicate entries that could cause infinite processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pool_info()] [Integer Overflow] Line 535 calculates commission_not_yet_unlocked as (total_stake - principal) * commission_percentage / 100 - can this overflow if total_stake is u64::MAX or if principal > total_stake due to on-chain corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pool_info()] [Division by Zero] Is commission_percentage validated to be <= 100, or can values > 100 cause incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior in commission computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pool_info()] [Underflow Attack] If principal > total_stake due to slashing or on-chain bugs, line 535 will underflow - is this checked, or can it cause wrapping arithmetic producing massive commission values? (High)",
