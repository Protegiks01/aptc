  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator_v2.rs] [Function: initialize_issuer_accounts()] [Test setup issue] Could the fixed balance of 1_000_000_000_000_000 in new_account_with_key_pair() be insufficient for certain test scenarios, causing tests to pass incorrectly when they should fail due to insufficient funds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator_v2.rs] [Function: run_block_in_parts_and_check()] [Test comparison logic] Does the assert_outputs_equal comparison properly handle all edge cases, or could subtle differences in transaction outputs between baseline and comparison harnesses be silently ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator_v2.rs] [Function: initialize_harness()] [Feature flag configuration] Could the feature flag configuration differences between aggregator_execution_enabled=true and false modes lead to inconsistent test coverage where certain bugs are only caught in one mode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aggregator_v2.rs] [Function: create_entry_agg_func_with_args()] [Transaction creation] Does the txn_index modulo operation for selecting transaction accounts create predictable patterns that could mask concurrency bugs in the actual aggregator implementation?
