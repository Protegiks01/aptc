(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker submit governance proposals with a type_name that partially matches ConfigOff::MOVE_TYPE_NAME or ConfigV1::MOVE_TYPE_NAME (e.g., with extra whitespace or Unicode normalization tricks) to bypass type validation and inject malicious config? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Error propagation] Can the anyhow::Error returned from Any::unpack fail silently or be caught incorrectly by upstream code, allowing partially deserialized invalid configs to be used in consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [BCS version incompatibility] Can an attacker exploit BCS version differences between validators running different node versions to deserialize the same bytes into different ConfigV1 structures, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to deserialize_into_config during epoch transitions lead to race conditions where validators see different configs at the same epoch boundary, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Malformed ConfigV1] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes where the outer MoveAny deserializes successfully but the inner ConfigV1 unpack contains malformed oidc_providers vector, allowing poison data to propagate into JWK consensus?
