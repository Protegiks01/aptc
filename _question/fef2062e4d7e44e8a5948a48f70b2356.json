  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Move Specific] [Module Dependency] If a function references types from other modules, does get_module() at line 198 correctly resolve cross-module dependencies, or can this fail with missing modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Rust Safety] [Unsafe Blocks] Are there any hidden unsafe blocks in dependencies (BTreeMap, PathBuf, etc.) that could cause undefined behavior with malicious inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Rust Safety] [Integer Overflow] When processing large numbers of functions, modules, or type arguments, can integer overflow occur in collection sizes or indices? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Dependencies] [GlobalEnv Trust] The code extensively uses GlobalEnv methods - if GlobalEnv provides corrupted or malicious data, can this cause ABIs to be generated with incorrect type information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Dependencies] [CompiledModule Trust] get_verified_module() returns a CompiledModule - but what if the 'verified' module was not actually verified properly, or verification was bypassed? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Configuration] [Default Directory] The default compiled_script_directory is '.' (current directory) - can this lead to unexpected file access if the tool is run from different directories? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Configuration] [Serde Deserialization] AbigenOptions uses serde with deny_unknown_fields - but can malicious JSON/YAML config files exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in serde? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Output] [File Overwrite] When inserting into output map at line 117, if a path already exists, is it silently overwritten? Can this cause loss of legitimate ABIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Output] [Filename Collision] If two different functions/modules generate ABIs with the same filename (after path manipulation), can collision occur leading to lost ABIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Output] [Path Canonicalization] Are output paths canonicalized before insertion into the map? Can different path representations (e.g., with/without trailing slashes) cause duplicate entries? (Low)",
