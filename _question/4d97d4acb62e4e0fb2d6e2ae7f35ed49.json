  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/testutils/builder.rs] [Network isolation] Test networks created by this builder share the same peer ID generation (via the same RNG seed). If multiple test networks run concurrently, could they interfere with each other via peer ID collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/testutils/builder.rs] [Cross-test contamination] If test framework instances are not properly isolated, could state from one test leak into another, causing false positives/negatives in the test suite? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/testutils/builder.rs] [Function: add_node()] [Minimum validator set] Does the builder enforce a minimum number of validators for consensus? Could tests create invalid configurations with <4 validators that bypass BFT safety thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/testutils/builder.rs] [Function: add_node()] [Maximum network size] Is there a practical limit to the number of nodes? Could memory exhaustion at large scales (1000+ nodes) crash the test harness before revealing scalability bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/testutils/builder.rs] [Validator proportion] In a mixed network of validators, VFNs, and PFNs, are there constraints on the proportion of each type? Could unrealistic ratios (99% validators, 1% full nodes) create test scenarios that don't match production? (Low)"
