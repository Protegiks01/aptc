(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/transaction_mix_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [RNG state manipulation] Is the StdRng state properly isolated between concurrent generator instances, or can concurrent access lead to predictable or biased transaction selection that skews load testing results? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/transaction_mix_generator.rs] [Function: create_transaction_generator()] [RNG entropy] Does the StdRng::from_entropy() call have sufficient entropy sources on all target platforms, or could weak entropy lead to colliding transaction patterns across multiple generator instances?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/transaction_mix_generator.rs] [Function: new()] [Weight sum verification] Is there validation that the sum of weights doesn't exceed usize::MAX, or can malicious test configurations cause overflow leading to incorrect probability distributions?
