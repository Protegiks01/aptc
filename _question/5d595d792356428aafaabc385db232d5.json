  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Timeout manipulation] Can a malicious peer send specially crafted RPC requests that take exactly 9,999ms to process, repeatedly approaching but not exceeding the 10-second timeout limit to degrade validator performance and delay consensus block processing without triggering timeout errors? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Resource exhaustion] Is the 10-second INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS value used in peer_manager/mod.rs sufficient to prevent resource exhaustion attacks where Byzantine validators send slow but valid RPC requests that consume handler threads for extended periods, potentially blocking critical consensus messages? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Consensus delay] Can an attacker exploit the fixed 10-second INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS to delay consensus by sending RPC requests that intentionally time out, forcing validators to wait the full timeout period before rejecting malicious proposals, potentially causing missed rounds and liveness degradation? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Race condition] When INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS expires in InboundRpcs::handle_inbound_request(), is there a race condition where the timeout fires simultaneously with a legitimate response, potentially causing response loss or double-processing that could lead to inconsistent state across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Priority bypass] Does the 10-second timeout apply uniformly to all RPC priority levels, or can low-priority RPC requests monopolize handler resources for 10 seconds each, starving high-priority consensus messages and causing safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Clock skew attack] Can Byzantine validators with manipulated system clocks exploit INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS by having significantly different timeout interpretations, causing some validators to timeout RPC requests prematurely while others wait longer, leading to inconsistent network behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Cascading timeout] If multiple validators simultaneously send RPC requests that all timeout at INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS (10 seconds), can this create a cascading failure where synchronized timeouts cause network-wide RPC storms, degrading consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Timeout forgery] Is the timeout enforcement in protocols/rpc/mod.rs tamper-proof, or can a malicious peer manipulate their local timeout value to extend beyond 10 seconds, allowing them to hold connections open longer than intended and exhaust connection pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [State sync exploitation] Can attackers exploit INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS during state synchronization by sending large state chunks that take close to 10 seconds to process, repeatedly triggering timeouts and preventing nodes from catching up to the network, causing permanent desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS] [Timeout accuracy] Does the TimeService implementation used with INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS have sufficient precision to prevent timing oracle attacks where attackers measure exact timeout durations to infer validator processing times and predict consensus behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Backpressure bypass] Can a malicious validator bypass the MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS limit of 100 by rapidly creating and destroying RPC connections, effectively circumventing backpressure mechanisms and flooding the network with more than 100 concurrent requests? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Counter race condition] Is the counter tracking concurrent outbound RPCs (limited to 100) in OutboundRpcs thread-safe, or can race conditions allow the actual count to exceed MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS, breaking backpressure guarantees and causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Consensus message blocking] When MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS (100) is reached, are critical consensus messages (votes, proposals) prioritized over less critical messages, or can low-priority RPCs consume all 100 slots and block consensus progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Validator targeting] Can a Byzantine validator selectively send exactly 100 concurrent outbound RPCs to a specific honest validator, exhausting their MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS capacity and preventing that validator from communicating with other peers, effectively partitioning them from consensus? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Slot exhaustion timing] If all 100 MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS slots are occupied by pending requests, how long does a new critical RPC (like a consensus vote) have to wait, and can this delay cause missed voting deadlines and consensus safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Limit bypass via channels] Does MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS properly account for RPC requests queued in network channels before being sent, or can attackers queue thousands of RPCs internally while staying under the 100 concurrent limit, then flood the network when slots become available? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Per-peer vs global limit] Is MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS enforced per-peer or globally across all peers, and can attackers exploit this by distributing 100 concurrent RPCs across multiple malicious peers to amplify their attack surface? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Leak on error] When an outbound RPC fails or times out, is the slot in MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS properly released, or can error handling bugs cause slot leaks that eventually exhaust all 100 slots permanently? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Integer overflow] Can the counter tracking outbound RPCs against MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS (100) overflow if incremented/decremented rapidly due to integer wraparound, allowing unlimited concurrent RPCs and breaking backpressure? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS] [Starvation attack] Can an attacker keep all 100 MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS slots permanently occupied with slow but valid RPCs, starving the validator of any outbound communication capacity and causing total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS] [Connection multiplexing] Can a single malicious peer open multiple TCP connections and send 100 inbound RPCs per connection, effectively bypassing the MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS limit of 100 and overwhelming validator resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS] [Slot reservation attack] Can Byzantine validators send exactly 100 inbound RPC requests that each take close to INBOUND_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS (10 seconds) to process, monopolizing all MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS slots and preventing honest validators from sending legitimate requests? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS] [Counter desynchronization] Is the inbound RPC counter that enforces MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS (100) synchronized across all Peer instances, or can concurrent access from multiple threads cause the actual number of processing RPCs to exceed 100, violating backpressure guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS] [Priority inversion] When MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS (100) is reached, does the system drop low-priority RPCs first, or can non-critical RPCs occupy all 100 slots and force the rejection of critical consensus messages, causing safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS] [Asymmetric limits] Since both MAX_CONCURRENT_INBOUND_RPCS and MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND_RPCS are set to 100, can attackers exploit asymmetries in RPC processing times to create deadlocks where validators cannot respond to inbound RPCs because their outbound RPC capacity is exhausted? (High)"
