  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: PartialEq for Ed25519PrivateKey] [Comparison cost] Key comparisons iterate over all 32 bytes - in scenarios with many key comparisons, can this become a performance bottleneck allowing DoS through comparison flooding? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash collision attacks] If many public keys hash to similar values, can attackers create hash collision chains that degrade validator set lookups to O(n) causing consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization determinism] Must return identical bytes across all platforms for consensus - are there endianness, padding, or alignment issues that could cause validators on different architectures to disagree on key representations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: sign()] [Signing determinism] All validators must produce identical signatures for consensus messages - are there any sources of non-determinism (RNG, timestamp, system state) that could cause signature mismatches?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: PartialEq for Ed25519PublicKey] [Equality determinism] Key equality must be consistent across all validators - can floating-point errors, optimization differences, or compiler variations cause the same keys to be considered different?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: from_bytes_unchecked()] [ZIP-215 compliance] Does signature verification follow ZIP-215 (allowing non-canonical encodings) or the stricter original Ed25519, and could this difference lead to consensus failures with other Ed25519 implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/ed25519/ed25519_keys.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG exhaustion] If the RNG provided to generate() is slow or blocking, can attackers cause validators to hang during key generation, preventing them from participating in consensus? (Medium)",
