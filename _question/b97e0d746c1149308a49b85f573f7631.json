  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Edge case] [Module conflicts] Can multiple modules with the same name but different addresses be added, and if so, does this cause module resolution ambiguity in the MoveVM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Edge case] [StateKey malformation] Can callers construct malformed StateKeys that pass type checking but cause panics or undefined behavior when used with the underlying storage system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Performance] [Large genesis] If genesis includes hundreds or thousands of modules, does the HashMap scale properly, or could performance degradation during genesis cause validators to timeout and fail initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Performance] [Memory pressure] During genesis with many large modules, could memory pressure cause swap thrashing or OOM kills on validators with limited RAM, leading to network launch failures? (Medium)"
