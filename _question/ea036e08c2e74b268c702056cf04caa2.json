  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Config Hot Swap] If block_gas_limit_type changes during block execution, can this cause inconsistent limit enforcement across transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: block_gas_limit()] [Override Mid-Block] Can block_gas_limit_override be modified mid-block execution, causing some transactions to see different limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: accumulate_fee_statement()] [Conflict Window Change] Can conflict_penalty_window change mid-block, causing compute_conflict_multiplier to use inconsistent window sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: accumulate_fee_statement()] [Granularity Toggle] Can use_granular_resource_group_conflicts toggle mid-block, causing inconsistent conflict detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: new()] [Malicious Configuration] Can a malicious validator construct BlockGasLimitProcessor with crafted block_gas_limit_override to bypass all limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: accumulate_fee_statement()] [False Conflict Reports] Can a malicious validator provide false ReadWriteSummary data to manipulate conflict multipliers and exclude competing validators' transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: should_end_block()] [Selective Block Termination] Can a malicious validator selectively halt blocks early when it benefits them economically or strategically? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/limit_processor.rs] [Function: finish_update_counters_and_log_info()] [Missing Validation Logs] Does the logging miss critical validation failures that should be alerted, allowing attacks to go unnoticed? (Medium)"
