  "[File: sdk/src/lib.rs] [Module: crypto re-export] [Dependency exposure] Does the blanket re-export 'pub use aptos_crypto::*' expose unsafe or internal cryptographic primitives that should not be part of the public SDK API, potentially allowing SDK users to misuse low-level crypto functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/lib.rs] [Module: move_types re-export] [Type confusion] Does re-exporting 'pub use move_core_types::*' create namespace collisions or type confusion risks where SDK users might accidentally use internal Move VM types instead of intended wrapper types? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/lib.rs] [Module: rest_client re-export] [API surface exposure] Does the 'pub use aptos_rest_client::*' re-export expose internal REST client implementation details that could be misused to bypass SDK's intended transaction construction and validation flow? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/lib.rs] [Module: bcs re-export] [Serialization bypass] Does directly re-exporting the 'bcs' crate allow SDK users to manually serialize transaction components in ways that bypass SDK safety checks in transaction_builder and types modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/lib.rs] [Module structure] [Missing validation] Are there missing validation wrappers or safety layers around the re-exported cryptographic and serialization primitives that could allow SDK users to construct invalid or dangerous transactions? (Medium)"
