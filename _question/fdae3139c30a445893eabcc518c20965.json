  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: wait_for_messages()] [Infinite loop] If num_messages is set too high due to dropped messages, does the while loop hang forever, preventing timeout-based liveness tests from working? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: wait_for_messages()] [Twin message duplication] Does the idx == 0 check prevent msg_copies from including messages to all twins, potentially hiding equivocation where different twins see different messages? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: wait_for_messages()] [Drop check TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-to-time-of-use race between is_message_dropped() and deliver_message() allowing messages to slip through partition boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: wait_for_messages()] [Message count assertion] Does the assert_eq!(msg_copies.len(), num_messages) hide scenarios where extra messages are delivered, indicating double-delivery bugs? (Medium)",
