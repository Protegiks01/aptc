  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: start()] [Session Boundary Violation] If start() is called multiple times within the same transaction or session, does this reset the counter mid-transaction, potentially allowing randomness reuse or counter manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [SessionListener] [Lifecycle Violation] Can malicious code call the SessionListener methods (start/finish/abort) directly, bypassing normal session management and manipulating randomness context state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: fetch_and_increment_txn_counter()] [Insufficient Caller Validation] Beyond the unbiasable flag check (line 82), are there any restrictions on which Move modules or accounts can call this native function, or can any smart contract access randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: mark_unbiasable()] [Public Method Exposure] Is mark_unbiasable() exposed through any public API, or can it only be called by trusted system code during transaction prologue validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: is_unbiasable()] [Information Disclosure] Should is_unbiasable() (lines 93-108) be callable by untrusted Move code, or does revealing this information help attackers determine if randomness APIs are accessible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [make_all()] [Native Function Registration] Are the native functions registered via make_all() (lines 110-122) properly restricted to authorized callers, or can any Move module import and call these natives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandomnessContext] [Extension Access Control] Can untrusted Move code access or modify the RandomnessContext extension directly, bypassing the native function access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: fetch_and_increment_txn_counter()] [Gas Charge Failure Handling] If the gas charge fails at line 78, does the function properly abort without incrementing the counter, or can partial state changes leak? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: fetch_and_increment_txn_counter()] [Abort Code Exposure] When returning the E_API_USE_SUSCEPTIBLE_TO_TEST_AND_ABORT error (line 83-85), does this abort code reveal too much information about internal security mechanisms that could help attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: fetch_and_increment_txn_counter()] [Empty Arguments Validation] The function accepts empty _args VecDeque (line 75) - is this intentional, or should it validate that no unexpected arguments are passed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: fetch_and_increment_txn_counter()] [Type Arguments Ignored] The _ty_args parameter is ignored (line 74) - could type parameter manipulation be used to bypass security checks or cause type confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: is_unbiasable()] [No Error Handling] The is_unbiasable() function has no error cases (lines 93-108) - can this be exploited if the RandomnessContext extension is missing or in an invalid state? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: increment()] [Empty Vec Handling] If txn_local_state somehow becomes an empty Vec, will the increment() loop at lines 53-60 handle this gracefully, or will it cause a panic or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: increment()] [Non-8-Byte Vec] If txn_local_state is not exactly 8 bytes (due to corruption or attack), will increment() behave correctly, or could it increment fewer/more bytes than expected? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Function: increment()] [Iteration Order Consistency] Does Rust guarantee that the iterator in lines 53-60 processes bytes in the same order on all validators' hardware architectures, or could endianness or optimizer differences cause divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandomnessContext] [Extension Initialization Order] Can differences in when RandomnessContext is initialized or added to extensions cause some validators to have the extension while others don't, leading to consensus divergence?
