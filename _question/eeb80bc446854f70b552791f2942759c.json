  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_supply] [Supply History Gaps] Does the schema enforce continuous supply tracking, or can gaps in transaction_version allow supply changes to go unrecorded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collection_datas] [Supply Integrity] Can the supply and maximum fields (both Numeric) be manipulated to allow minting beyond collection limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collection_datas] [Mutability Flags] Can the maximum_mutable, uri_mutable, and description_mutable flags be changed after collection creation to violate immutability guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collection_datas] [URI Length Attack] The metadata_uri field allows 512 characters - can excessively long URIs cause storage or processing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collection_datas] [Collection Name Collision] With collection_name limited to 128 characters, can identical collection names from different creators cause confusion or indexing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collections_v2] [V1/V2 Inconsistency] Can the table_handle_v1 Nullable field create inconsistencies when migrating between NFT v1 and v2, potentially duplicating or losing collection data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collections_v2] [Max Supply Null Attack] Is max_supply Nullable to support unlimited collections, or can this be exploited to bypass supply limits after collection creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collections_v2] [Total Minted Manipulation] Can total_minted_v2 (Nullable Numeric) be manipulated independently of current_supply to hide minting/burning activity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: collections_v2] [Token Standard Validation] The token_standard field is limited to 10 characters - is there validation ensuring only valid standards (e.g., 'v1', 'v2') are stored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_ans_lookup] [Domain Expiration Bypass] Can the expiration_timestamp be manipulated to extend domain ownership beyond legitimate expiration, enabling domain squatting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_ans_lookup] [Registered Address Nullability] The registered_address is Nullable - can this lead to domains existing without owners, causing resolution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_ans_lookup] [Domain/Subdomain Length] Both domain and subdomain are limited to 64 characters - can truncation cause collision between different fully-qualified names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_ans_lookup] [Transaction Version Rollback] Can last_transaction_version be decremented to revert domain ownership changes, bypassing transfer restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_coin_balances] [Stale Balance Attack] Can last_transaction_version lag behind actual blockchain state, causing queries to return outdated balances and enabling double-spend exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_coin_balances] [Balance Consistency] Is there atomicity guarantee between amount and last_transaction_version updates, or can race conditions create inconsistent balance snapshots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_coin_balances] [Negative Balance Storage] Does the schema prevent negative amount values, or can accounting errors create impossible negative balance states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_collection_datas] [Current State Corruption] Can last_transaction_version be manipulated to point to outdated collection metadata, hiding supply changes or mutability updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_collection_datas] [Supply/Maximum Mismatch] Can supply exceed maximum despite maximum_mutable being false, indicating a violation of collection supply constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_collections_v2] [Current Supply Integrity] Can current_supply be manipulated independently of token minting/burning events to hide actual token circulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_collections_v2] [Nullable Mutability Flags] The mutable_description and mutable_uri are Nullable - can NULL values bypass mutability restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_delegated_staking_pool_balances] [Staking Pool Funds Mismatch] Can total_coins and total_shares become inconsistent, causing incorrect reward distribution or withdrawal calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_delegated_staking_pool_balances] [Commission Manipulation] Can operator_commission_percentage (Numeric) exceed 100% or be negative, enabling operators to steal delegator rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_delegated_staking_pool_balances] [Table Handle Corruption] Can inactive_table_handle and active_table_handle point to invalid or swapped tables, corrupting stake accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_delegator_balances] [Shares Manipulation] Can the shares (Numeric) field be manipulated to give delegators disproportionate withdrawal rights from the staking pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: current_delegator_balances] [Pool Type Confusion] The pool_type field (100 char Varchar) - can malformed or unexpected pool types bypass delegation restrictions? (Medium)"
