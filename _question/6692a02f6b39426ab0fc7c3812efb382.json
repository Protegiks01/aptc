  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Optimization determinism] Do optimization experiments (OPTIMIZE, OPTIMIZE_EXTRA, etc.) guarantee deterministic output across different compilations, or can they produce semantically equivalent but binary-different bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Experiment interaction] Can the combination of INLINING=on, DEAD_CODE_ELIMINATION=on, and VARIABLE_COALESCING=on create emergent bugs that don't occur with any single optimization? (High)",
