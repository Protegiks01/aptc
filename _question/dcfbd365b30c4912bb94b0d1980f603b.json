  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: old_uri()] [URI consistency] Is there validation that old_uri matches the actual previous URI stored on-chain, or can attackers emit events with arbitrary old_uri values rewriting history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new_uri()] [URI reachability] Can new_uri point to unreachable URLs, IPFS hashes that don't exist, or content that violates platform policies, causing downstream systems to fail when fetching metadata? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Move bytecode exploitation] Can malicious Move bytecode use type reflection to construct UriMutationEvent structs that bypass Move's type safety, enabling unauthorized event emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Resource model violation] Can UriMutationEvent be inappropriately used as a Move resource type instead of just an event type, breaking Move's resource safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Capability bypass] Can Move modules without proper token mutation capabilities still create and emit UriMutationEvents, bypassing access control enforced by the token framework? (Critical)",

(Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Empty bytes] What happens if try_from_bytes() receives empty byte array - does it panic, return error, or create invalid event causing downstream crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial bytes] Can incomplete BCS bytes cause try_from_bytes() to return partial events or undefined behavior where some fields are uninitialized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero-length strings] Can new() accept empty strings for all fields, creating semantically meaningless events that waste storage and confuse indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: creator()] [Null address] Can creator() return the zero address (0x0), and if so, does this cause privilege escalation where system-level actions appear to be from null address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [Thread safety] Is the Lazy initialization of URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE thread-safe in all execution contexts (consensus, mempool, API), or can race conditions cause inconsistent type tag values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Concurrent deserialization] Can concurrent deserialization of the same event bytes by multiple threads cause data corruption or inconsistent state if BCS has mutable global state? (Medium)",
