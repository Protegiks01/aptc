  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Log ordering] When multiple threads in a validator generate logs concurrently via these macros, are log entries guaranteed to be written in a consistent order, or can race conditions cause logs to be reordered in ways that hide the true sequence of consensus events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Resource cleanup] If a validator crashes while Event::dispatch() (line 64) is in progress, are partially-written log entries properly handled, or can log corruption occur that makes forensic analysis of consensus attacks impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: spawn_named] [Error handling difference] The non-tokio-console variant silently ignores spawn results (lines 9-15) while the tokio-console variant panics on failure (lines 20-47) - can this behavioral difference be exploited to cause inconsistent validator behavior across different builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: log] [Metadata caching] Is the const METADATA on line 56 properly cached per call site, or can changes to log levels require recompilation to take effect, preventing operators from dynamically adjusting logging during active consensus attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Recursive depth limit] Does the recursive schema! macro (lines 128-255) have a depth limit, or can attackers craft deeply nested schema arguments that exceed compiler recursion limits and prevent validator compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Signal handler interaction] If validators receive signals (like SIGTERM) while executing log macros, do the macros properly handle signal interruption, or can interrupted log operations leave files in inconsistent states that corrupt audit trails? (Low)"
