  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: jwk_consensus_enabled()] [Selective enabling] Can malicious validators selectively enable/disable JWK consensus to censor keyless account transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: oidc_providers_cloned()] [Stale clones] Can validators cache cloned provider lists and miss updates, causing divergent JWK verification results? (High)",
