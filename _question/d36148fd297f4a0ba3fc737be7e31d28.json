  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the generic AggregatorResource<T> to instantiate ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource with a different type parameter (not u64), bypassing balance constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource] [Deserialization attack] Since ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource only derives Debug/Serialize/Deserialize (not Clone/Eq), can crafted serialized data bypass integrity checks during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: MigrationFlag] [Dummy field bypass] The MigrationFlag contains only a dummy bool field - can this 1-byte struct be exploited to bypass migration checks by setting dummy=true when migration should be prevented? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: MigrationFlag] [Default semantics] MigrationFlag derives Default with dummy=false - can attackers exploit default initialization to enable unauthorized migrations before explicit flag setting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: MigrationFlag] [Multiple instantiation] Can multiple MigrationFlag instances be created under the same account, allowing attacker to selectively choose which flag to check and bypass migration restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: MigrationFlag] [Module confusion] The flag references module 'coin' not 'fungible_asset' - can this module mismatch be exploited to create conflicting migration states across different asset types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Struct: MigrationFlag] [Arbitrary derive] MigrationFlag implements Arbitrary for fuzzing - are there edge cases in the dummy bool generation that could expose migration vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Interaction: FungibleStoreResource + ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource] [Inconsistent balances] Can an account have both FungibleStoreResource and ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource simultaneously, leading to double balance tracking and potential double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Interaction: FungibleStoreResource + MigrationFlag] [Migration race] During coin-to-fungible-asset migration, can an attacker exploit race conditions between FungibleStoreResource creation and MigrationFlag setting to duplicate funds? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType for FungibleStoreResource] [Module name mismatch] Both FungibleStoreResource and ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource use MODULE_NAME='fungible_asset' - can this cause type confusion if both exist at the same address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType for FungibleStoreResource] [Struct name collision] Can an attacker create a custom Move module with struct name 'FungibleStore' that collides with the official implementation, causing validators to load the wrong resource? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Type safety] The MoveResource trait is implemented without additional constraints - can this allow improper casting between FungibleStoreResource and unrelated resource types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize for FungibleStoreResource] [Metadata address manipulation] During deserialization, can an attacker provide a metadata address that points to a malicious contract, causing funds to be drained when the store is accessed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize for FungibleStoreResource] [Balance tampering] Can serialized FungibleStoreResource data be intercepted and modified in storage/transit to increase the balance field before deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize for FungibleStoreResource] [Frozen flag bypass] Can deserialization be exploited to flip the frozen flag from true to false, unfreezing sanctioned accounts without authorization? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/fungible_store.rs] [Derive: PartialEq for MigrationFlag] [Dummy field comparison] Since comparison only checks dummy bool, can functionally different migration states appear equal, bypassing migration guards? (Low)",
