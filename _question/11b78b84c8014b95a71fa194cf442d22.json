  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_named_natives()] [Duplicate names] If the iterator contains duplicate function names, can this cause native function shadowing or override security-critical functions with malicious implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_named_natives()] [Name validation] Function names from the iterator (line 191) are converted to String without validation. Can malicious names containing special characters or escape sequences cause injection vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Closure capture] The closure at line 98 captures data (Arc) and hook (Option<Arc>).

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Static lifetime requirement] The native function parameter requires 'static lifetime (line 91).

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [SmallVec overflow] SmallVec<[Value; 1]> is used for return values.
