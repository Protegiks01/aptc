  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious starting_path containing '..' sequences or symlinks that cause try_find_root() to traverse outside intended directories and discover/execute malicious Move.toml manifests from unauthorized locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Symlink Attack] Does try_find_root() follow symbolic links when checking for Move.toml files, allowing an attacker to create a symlink pointing to a malicious manifest outside the package directory, potentially loading untrusted code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [TOCTOU Race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use race condition where try_find_root() checks if Move.toml is_file() but the file could be replaced with a malicious manifest between the check and actual use by calling code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Infinite Loop] Can an attacker craft a filesystem condition (circular symlinks, unusual mount points) that causes the loop in try_find_root() to traverse indefinitely without the current_path.pop() ever returning false, leading to resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Path Canonicalization] Does try_find_root() properly canonicalize paths before traversal, or can attackers use techniques like '//' or '/./' to bypass directory traversal protections in parent path checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Root Filesystem Access] Can try_find_root() be exploited to search all the way to the root filesystem directory '/' if no Move.toml is found, potentially exposing sensitive system-wide package manifests or causing unintended behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Error Message Information Leak] Does the bail! error message in try_find_root() leak sensitive filesystem path information that could aid an attacker in mapping the validator's directory structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Cross-Volume Traversal] Can try_find_root() traverse across different filesystem volumes/mountpoints, potentially accessing Move.toml files on mounted external drives or network shares that shouldn't be trusted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Permission Bypass] Does try_find_root() respect filesystem permissions, or can it find and report Move.toml files that the current process shouldn't have permission to access, leading to privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root()] [Hidden File Detection] Can try_find_root() be tricked by hidden Move.toml files (prepended with '.') or files with special attributes on Windows that shouldn't be considered valid package roots? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: path()] [Path Injection] Can the Path returned by path() be used in unsafe path concatenation operations that allow attackers to inject '../' sequences through malicious enum variant manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: path()] [Platform Compatibility] Does path() return platform-specific paths that could behave differently on Windows vs Unix systems, leading to directory traversal on one platform but not another? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: path()] [Null Byte Injection] Can the static strings returned by location_str() and used in path() be exploited with null byte injection to truncate paths and access unintended directories? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: location_str()] [Path Traversal Patterns] Do the hardcoded location strings in location_str() ('sources', 'tests', etc.) undergo validation to prevent path traversal if they're somehow modified or if new variants are added with malicious paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: location_str()] [Reserved Names] Are the directory names returned by location_str() validated against OS-reserved names (CON, PRN, AUX on Windows) that could cause undefined behavior when used in path operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: location_str()] [Case Sensitivity] Can case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows) cause collisions where 'Sources' and 'sources' are treated as the same directory, leading to confused deputy attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: is_optional()] [Required File Bypass] If is_optional() returns incorrect values due to enum variant additions, could an attacker create packages missing required components (Sources, Manifest) that still pass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: is_optional()] [Build Directory Manipulation] Since Build is marked as optional, can an attacker pre-populate a 'build' directory with malicious artifacts that get used instead of freshly compiled code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Enum: SourcePackageLayout] [Exhaustive Matching] If new variants are added to SourcePackageLayout enum, do all match statements remain exhaustive to prevent undefined behavior from unhandled cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Enum: SourcePackageLayout] [Serialization Safety] If SourcePackageLayout is serialized/deserialized, can an attacker craft invalid enum discriminants that bypass type safety and cause memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Functions: path() + try_find_root()] [Composed Path Traversal] Can an attacker chain the outputs of path() and try_find_root() to construct paths that escape the package directory when joined together? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Functions: location_str() + path()] [String-to-Path Conversion] Are there encoding issues when converting location_str() strings to Path objects that could allow Unicode-based path traversal attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root() integration] [Manifest Injection] After try_find_root() finds a Move.toml, does the calling code validate the manifest contents to prevent malicious configurations (e.g., dependencies pointing to malicious Git repos)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Function: try_find_root() integration] [Source File Overwrite] Can an attacker exploit try_find_root() to load a package where the 'sources' directory contains malicious Move code that overwrites or shadows standard library modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/source_package/layout.rs] [Variant: Build] [Artifact Poisoning] Since the Build variant points to 'build' directory for compiled artifacts, can an attacker pre-seed this directory with malicious bytecode that gets loaded instead of freshly compiled code? (Critical)"
