  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Line: 31] [Type Safety] Does the FunctionTarget type guarantee that its internal state is valid before register_formatters() is called, or could a corrupted FunctionTarget cause undefined behavior during formatter registration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [API Contract] Is there a documented contract for when register_formatters() should be called in the compilation pipeline, or could calling it at the wrong time cause formatters to see inconsistent or incomplete annotation data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Lifetime Management] Does the function properly handle the lifetime of formatters registered with FunctionTarget, or could formatters outlive the data they reference, causing use-after-free when printing bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Supply Chain Attack] Could a compromised build system inject malicious formatters during the registration process, causing the compiler to generate backdoored bytecode that appears correct in debugging output? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Compiler Bomb] Can a malicious Move program cause register_formatters() to register an unbounded number of formatters or formatters with expensive display logic, creating a compiler DoS that prevents framework upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Deterministic Compilation] Does formatter registration affect the determinism of compilation output, or could non-deterministic formatter behavior cause different bytecode to be generated from the same source across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Annotation Correctness] Do the formatters registered by this function provide accurate representations of the analysis state, or could incorrect formatters display misleading information that causes auditors to miss vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Information Disclosure] Could formatters inadvertently expose sensitive compilation internals or intermediate states that reveal vulnerabilities in the compiler itself to attackers analyzing bytecode dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Debugging Consistency] If different builds use different sets of registered formatters, could this cause inconsistent debugging experiences that make it difficult to diagnose issues across environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Framework Module Safety] If register_formatters() fails when compiling critical framework modules (aptos_governance, stake, coin), could this allow vulnerable system code to be deployed without proper analysis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [User Contract Security] Can missing formatter registration when compiling user-submitted Move modules prevent detection of security bugs in those modules, leading to vulnerable contracts managing user funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/mod.rs] [Function: register_formatters()] [Upgrade Safety] During on-chain protocol upgrades that recompile framework modules, could formatter registration failures hide bugs introduced by the upgrade, causing consensus failures after deployment? (Critical)"
