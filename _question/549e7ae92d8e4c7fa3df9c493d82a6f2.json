  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: generate_waypoint()] [Waypoint manipulation] Can an attacker supply a malicious genesis transaction that produces a valid waypoint but initializes the chain with compromised validator sets or corrupted state, allowing them to control consensus from genesis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: generate_waypoint()] [State inconsistency] Does generate_waypoint verify that the ledger_summary obtained from get_pre_committed_ledger_summary matches expected invariants, or can a corrupted database state cause waypoint generation with invalid state roots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: generate_waypoint()] [Genesis transaction validation] Is the genesis transaction validated for correct Move bytecode and resource initialization before waypoint generation, or can malformed transactions pass through and corrupt the initial chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: generate_waypoint()] [Database race condition] Can concurrent calls to generate_waypoint on the same database cause race conditions in reading ledger_summary or executing calculate_genesis, leading to inconsistent waypoint generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: generate_waypoint()] [Error handling bypass] If calculate_genesis returns an error, are there any error paths that could leave the database in a partially initialized state that bypasses security checks in subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Waypoint bypass] In the version check at line 57, can an attacker manipulate the ledger version to make 'ledger_summary.version().map_or(0, |v| v + 1) != waypoint.version()' always true, causing the function to skip genesis execution and bypass waypoint verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Version overflow] In the version arithmetic 'ledger_summary.version().map_or(0, |v| v + 1)' at line 57, if v is u64::MAX, can integer overflow cause the check to fail and allow bootstrap at incorrect versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Waypoint verification weakness] At line 63-68, does the waypoint equality check 'waypoint == committer.waypoint()' prevent an attacker from constructing a genesis transaction that produces a matching waypoint but contains malicious state initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Commit atomicity] Between the waypoint verification at line 63 and the commit at line 70, can an attacker cause a state change that makes the verified waypoint invalid before commit executes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Ledger info manipulation] After cloning ledger_info at line 69 but before commit, can concurrent operations modify the ledger_info_opt, causing inconsistency between the verified waypoint and committed ledger info? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Return value attack] Can an attacker exploit the Option<LedgerInfoWithSignatures> return value to distinguish between bootstrap states and use timing attacks to infer internal blockchain state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: maybe_bootstrap()] [Skip condition exploitation] When the function returns Ok(None) at line 59, does the caller properly handle this case, or can it lead to assumptions about bootstrap completion that allow subsequent security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::new()] [Missing ledger info] At line 82-86, if ledger_info_opt is None, the function returns an error. Can an attacker craft an ExecutedChunk with None ledger_info to cause genesis initialization failure and prevent blockchain bootstrap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::new()] [Waypoint creation failure] If Waypoint::new_epoch_boundary() at line 87 fails due to invalid ledger info, can this leave the system in a partially initialized state with a created GenesisCommitter that has invalid waypoint data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::new()] [DbWriter clone safety] Is the Arc<dyn DbWriter> clone at line 90 thread-safe when multiple GenesisCommitter instances are created concurrently, or can shared mutable state cause corruption during genesis commit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::new()] [ExecutedChunk validation] Does new() validate that the ExecutedChunk output contains valid transaction execution results, or can an attacker pass a malformed output that bypasses later validation in commit()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Struct: GenesisCommitter] [Field visibility] Are the fields db, output, and waypoint at lines 75-77 properly encapsulated to prevent external modification after GenesisCommitter creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Transaction atomicity] Does the save_transactions call at line 101 guarantee atomic commitment of genesis state, or can partial commits occur if the operation fails midway, leaving the database in an inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [expect_complete_result panic] At line 104, expect_complete_result() can panic if the output is not complete. Can an attacker craft execution output that causes this panic after database writes have started, corrupting genesis state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Sync commit bypass] The sync_commit flag is hardcoded to true at line 107. If this were configurable, could disabling it allow race conditions where uncommitted genesis state is read by other operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Post-commit failure] The comment at line 110 states 'avoid anything that could fail after this'. If operations after save_transactions fail, can this leave the system in a committed but uninitialized state causing consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Ledger info reference] The ledger_info_opt.as_ref() at line 106 passes an Option reference. Can None value here bypass signature verification or allow unsigned genesis commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Self consumption] The commit() method consumes self. Can this prevent proper cleanup if the commit fails, leaving database locks or resources unreleased? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/db_bootstrapper/mod.rs] [Function: GenesisCommitter::commit()] [Error propagation] If save_transactions returns an error, is the error properly categorized to distinguish between transient and permanent failures that require different recovery strategies?
