  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PrunerOpt::pruner_config()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide extremely large values for state_prune_window, epoch_snapshot_prune_window, or ledger_prune_window that cause integer overflow when used in pruning calculations, potentially corrupting the test database or causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PrunerOpt::pruner_config()] [Resource exhaustion] Can setting pruning_batch_size values (ledger_pruning_batch_size, state_pruning_batch_size, epoch_snapshot_pruning_batch_size) to extremely small values (e.g., 1) cause performance degradation severe enough to halt benchmark execution, creating a local DoS condition? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PrunerOpt::pruner_config()] [Configuration bypass] Can an attacker enable all pruners simultaneously with conflicting window sizes that create race conditions between different pruner types, leading to inconsistent database state during benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PrunerOpt::pruner_config()] [Logic error] Is there validation that prune_window values are greater than batch_size values? Can misconfigurations where batch_size > prune_window cause pruner logic errors or infinite loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: StorageOpt::storage_test_config()] [State corruption] Can enabling both enable_storage_sharding and enable_indexer_grpc simultaneously create race conditions in database writes that corrupt the test storage state, affecting benchmark validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PipelineOpt::pipeline_config()] [Division by zero] In the pipeline configuration at lines 188-189, if num_executor_shards is set to a non-zero value but execution_threads is 0, could this cause a division by zero when calculating threads per shard in main()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PipelineOpt::pipeline_config()] [Logic bypass] Can setting both generate_then_execute and split_stages to true create an execution path where transactions are generated twice or executed out of order, producing invalid benchmark results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PipelineOpt::pipeline_config()] [State inconsistency] When skip_commit is true, transactions are executed but never committed - can this cause memory leaks if executed blocks accumulate without bounds, potentially exhausting system memory during long benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: PipelineOpt::pipeline_config()] [Validation bypass] The allow_aborts, allow_discards, and allow_retries flags control transaction failure handling - can enabling all three simultaneously bypass safety checks that would otherwise detect executor bugs or state corruption?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: ShardingOpt::partitioner_config()] [Floating point manipulation] The partitioner_cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold is a f32 with default 0.90 - can values outside [0.0, 1.0] or NaN/Infinity cause partitioner logic errors or panics?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: ShardingOpt::partitioner_config()] [Panic condition] The panic at lines 250-253 for unknown partitioner versions - can version strings with special characters, very long lengths, or Unicode cause unexpected panics or bypass the validation?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Command: CreateDb] [Path traversal] The data_dir parameter at line 370 is a PathBuf - is there validation to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., '../../../') that could create databases in unauthorized directories or overwrite system files?
