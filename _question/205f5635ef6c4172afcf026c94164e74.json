  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_client_get_transaction()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker exploit potential HashValue collisions to retrieve wrong transactions, causing clients to sign or rely on incorrect transaction data? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_client_get_transaction()] [Information Timing] Can the latency difference between found/not-found transactions be used as a timing oracle to determine if specific transactions are in mempool? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_client_get_transaction()] [Lock Holding] Does mempool.lock() (line 199) being held during the get_by_hash lookup create DoS vulnerability if hash lookups are slow or if attacker sends many requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_client_get_transaction()] [Transaction Privacy] Can this function be used to probe mempool contents and identify high-value transactions before they're committed, enabling MEV or frontrunning attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_client_get_transaction()] [Callback Race] If multiple get_transaction requests race for the same hash, can inconsistent responses be returned if the transaction is removed between requests? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Malicious Timestamp] Can the optional timestamp (Option<u64> at line 218) be manipulated by malicious peers to bypass timeline ordering and cause transactions to be prioritized incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Broadcast Amplification] Can an attacker send the same transactions with different message_ids to cause processing redundancy and exhaust validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [ACK Manipulation] Can a malicious peer interpret the ack_response (line 234) incorrectly or ignore backoff signals to continue flooding the node with transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Timeline State Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the timeline_state parameter to force transactions into ready state prematurely, bypassing normal validation flow? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Priority Confusion] Can BroadcastPeerPriority values be spoofed by peers to cause legitimate transactions to be deprioritized in favor of spam? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Network Send Failure] If send_message_to_peer fails (line 239-249), does the peer incorrectly assume success and stop retransmitting legitimate transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Subscriber Notification] Can notify_subscribers (line 251) be exploited to trigger excessive callbacks that degrade performance or cause cascading failures? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Message ID Replay] Can the same message_id be reused across different broadcast sessions to bypass deduplication or cause double-processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: process_transaction_broadcast()] [Peer Spoofing] Can the peer: PeerNetworkId parameter be spoofed to cause transactions to be attributed to wrong peers, affecting reputation and filtering logic? (High)",

  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: gen_ack_response()] [Single Transaction Attack] Does checking only MempoolIsFull status (line 262) miss other critical errors that should also trigger backoff, allowing certain attack vectors to continue? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: gen_ack_response()] [Counter Inconsistency] Can the update_ack_counter call (line 268-273) race with concurrent ack responses, causing metrics to be incorrect and hiding attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: gen_ack_response()] [Status Code Confusion] Can other MempoolStatusCode values that should trigger backoff be missed by only checking MempoolIsFull, allowing DoS attacks to continue? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: gen_ack_response()] [Retry Storm] If all peers simultaneously receive backoff_and_retry=true, can the synchronized retry attempts create a thundering herd that crashes the network? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: gen_ack_response()] [Early Break Optimization] Does the early break (line 264) after finding first MempoolIsFull prevent detecting multiple full conditions that should trigger different backoff strategies? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/tasks.rs] [Function: update_ack_counter()] [Metrics Manipulation] Can incorrect retry/backoff flags cause counter increments that don't reflect reality, leading to wrong operational decisions during attacks? (Low)",
