  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Key validation] Does import_private_key() validate the imported key's cryptographic properties, or can weak/malicious keys be imported that compromise validator security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Race condition] Between checking if key exists via get_public_key() and creating it via create_ed25519_key(), can concurrent create_key() calls create duplicate keys or cause key creation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Duplicate check] Similar to create_key(), can race conditions allow multiple imports of different keys with the same name, causing key confusion and signature validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: available()] [Vault seal state] If Vault becomes sealed during operation (not just at startup check), do subsequent operations fail safely or leak sensitive data through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Timestamp parsing] Can malformed RFC3339 timestamps in resp.creation_time cause parse failures that crash the validator node or expose timing information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Deserialization attack] Can malicious JSON values in Vault cause serde_json::from_value() to panic, consume excessive memory, or execute arbitrary code through deserialization gadgets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Serialization failure] If serde_json::to_value() fails for certain types, does the error handling prevent partial writes that could corrupt Vault state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Integer truncation] When casting timestamp() to u64 in 'timestamp() as u64', can negative timestamps or overflow cause incorrect last_update values that break time-based security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: secret_versions] [RwLock deadlock] Can concurrent get() calls holding read locks while set() tries to acquire write lock cause deadlocks that halt validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: secret_versions] [Memory leak] Does secret_versions HashMap grow unbounded as secrets are created, eventually causing OOM that crashes the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Concurrent reset] If reset_and_clear() runs concurrently with active operations, can it delete secrets/keys while they're being used, causing signing failures or data loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_kv()] [Recursive deletion] Can an attacker create deeply nested secret paths that cause stack overflow in recursive reset_kv() calls during reset operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Shared state] Does the shared Client reference cause any state corruption when multiple threads access Vault simultaneously through the same connection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_kv()] [Production exposure] If reset_kv() is accidentally available in production builds, can an attacker trigger it to delete all validator secrets causing permanent loss of consensus participation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_crypto()] [Key deletion] If reset_crypto() is accessible in production, can it be used to delete all validator signing keys, effectively stealing funds by making them unrecoverable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: revoke_token_self()] [Token revocation] Can revoke_token_self() be called by mistake in production, permanently revoking access to validator keys and causing irreversible validator shutdown? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_all_key_versions()] [Information leak] Does exposing all key versions through get_all_key_versions() in testing builds allow attackers to analyze key rotation patterns and predict future keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::create_token()] [Policy injection] Can an attacker inject malicious policy names through the policies vector that bypass namespace prefixing and gain unauthorized access to other validators' secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::set_policy()] [Policy overwrites] Does set_policy() properly merge new capabilities with existing ones, or can it accidentally remove permissions causing loss of access to validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::set_policy()] [Capability escalation] Can the export/rotate/sign capability additions be exploited to grant more permissions than intended, allowing key theft through policy manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::reset_policies()] [Default policy deletion] Can the check for 'default' and 'root' policies be bypassed with crafted policy names (e.g., 'default ', 'Default') causing critical Vault policies to be deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::name()] [Namespace bypass] Can malicious namespace values in name() construction cause path traversal in Vault, accessing secrets outside the intended namespace? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: new()] [Certificate validation] If certificate is None, does Client establish TLS connections without cert validation, allowing MITM attacks on Vault communication exposing validator keys? (Critical)",
