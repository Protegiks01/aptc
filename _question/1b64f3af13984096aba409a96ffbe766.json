  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [All CryptoStorage functions] [Key handle lifetime] Are cryptographic key handles properly managed and zeroized after use, or can key material persist in memory allowing recovery through memory dumps or cold boot attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Enum: Storage (lines 19-24)] [Backend privilege escalation] Can an attacker exploit differences in security properties between storage backends (e.g., VaultStorage with HSM vs. InMemoryStorage) to escalate privileges by forcing backend switching? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/storage.rs] [Enum: Storage (line 21)] [InMemoryStorage key leakage] Does InMemoryStorage properly protect key material from memory dumps, or can attackers with memory access trivially extract all validator keys stored in RAM? (Critical)",
