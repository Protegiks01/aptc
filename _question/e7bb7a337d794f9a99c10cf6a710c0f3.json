  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Related-Key Attack] Can an attacker exploit mathematical relationships between public keys to forge signatures when multiple related keys are used, even though each individual signature verifies correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Fault Injection Attack] In a hardware-level attack scenario, can injecting faults during the signature verification at line 58 cause incorrect acceptance of invalid signatures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Curve25519 vs. Ed25519 Confusion] Can keys intended for X25519 (Diffie-Hellman) be accidentally validated and used for Ed25519 signatures, leading to security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Length Extension Attack] Does verify_arbitrary_msg() properly handle message length, or can attackers append data to messages and produce valid signatures through length extension? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Chosen-Message Attack] Can an attacker who obtains valid signatures for chosen messages exploit mathematical properties of Ed25519 to forge signatures for other messages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Move VM Integration Bug] Does the Move VM properly sanitize the Vec<u8> arguments before passing to this native function, or can malicious Move bytecode inject crafted byte sequences that exploit parsing bugs? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Serialization Format Mismatch] If Move code serializes public keys differently than this function expects, can format mismatches cause valid keys to be rejected or invalid keys to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Gas Metering Bypass] Can attackers call this function through a gas-free system contract or privileged context, allowing unlimited signature verifications without paying gas? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Transaction Ordering Dependency] If signature verification results depend on transaction ordering in a block, can block producers manipulate ordering to cause legitimate transactions to fail verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [State Consistency Issue] If this validation function is called during transaction prologue but the key is later revoked, can there be a TOCTOU race where the key is valid at verification but invalid at execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Signature with Leading Zeros] If the signature bytes start with multiple zero bytes, does try_from() at line 45 handle this correctly, or can zero-padding cause signature malleability?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Message with NUL Bytes] Can messages containing NUL bytes (0x00) be verified correctly, or do C-string assumptions anywhere in the call chain cause truncation?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Unicode Normalization] If msg contains text in different Unicode normalizations (NFC vs NFD), does this affect verification, enabling signature to verify for one normalization but not another?
