  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Log Injection] Can the explanation and headline strings be used for log injection attacks by including newlines or format specifiers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [Counter vs Gauge Semantics] Does treating Counter and Gauge metrics identically cause semantic issues where counters (monotonically increasing) are compared with gauges (fluctuating values)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [Value::Untyped Handling] Does accepting Value::Untyped metrics allow attackers to send metrics of unknown type that have unexpected behavior when rounded to u64? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [Wildcard Pattern Warning] Does the wildcard pattern in the value match only log a warning, allowing unexpected metric types to silently return None and hide connectivity data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Interface Contract] Does the Checker trait guarantee that check() always returns at least one CheckResult, or can empty vectors cause panics in consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Enum Consistency] Does returning Ok(Vec<CheckResult>) for both success and failure cases make it difficult for consumers to distinguish between checker errors and validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Type: CheckerError] [Error Handling Completeness] Does wrapping errors in CheckerError provide enough context for debugging, or can important error details be lost during error propagation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Can the connection counts change between when metrics are scraped and when validation occurs, creating TOCTOU vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Boolean to Score Mapping] Does mapping boolean pass/fail to scores 100/50 create a system where 50% success rate is considered acceptable, potentially hiding serious issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Atomicity of Check] Is the check operation atomic, or can the node's connection state change during the check, leading to inconsistent inbound/outbound evaluations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: MetricsProvider] [HTTP Injection] Can attackers inject HTTP headers or manipulate the metrics_url to perform SSRF attacks against internal services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: MetricsProvider] [TLS Verification] Does the reqwest client verify TLS certificates when fetching metrics, or can MITM attackers inject fake connection counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: MetricsProvider] [Response Size Limit] Is there a size limit on the HTTP response from /metrics, or can attackers cause memory exhaustion by sending gigabyte-sized metric dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Result Tuple Ordering] Does the function guarantee that inbound is always first and outbound second in the returned tuple, or can tuple ordering bugs cause swapped values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Overall Logic] [Checker Bypass] Can operators disable the MinimumPeersChecker entirely by setting self.config.common.required to false, bypassing peer connectivity validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Overall Logic] [False Positive Rate] What is the false positive rate where healthy nodes fail validation due to transient network issues or metric scraping failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Overall Logic] [False Negative Rate] What is the false negative rate where unhealthy nodes pass validation due to cached metrics, metric manipulation, or insufficient thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Validation Granularity] Does checking only total connection counts miss issues with connection diversity (all connections to same subnet/ASN)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Connection Type Validation] Does the checker verify that connections are actually to blockchain peers and not to unrelated services on the same host? (Medium)"
