  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [URL Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the path parameter to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by injecting malicious URLs through the join() operation, potentially accessing internal services or exfiltrating data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [Error Handling] Does the error handling at lines 143-145 properly sanitize error messages before returning them, or can it leak sensitive internal state information (private keys, internal addresses, configuration) through verbose error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [Response Validation] Is there any validation that the JSON response structure matches expected types before deserialization at line 148, or can a malicious Rosetta server cause panic/memory corruption by sending crafted responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [DoS Attack] Can a malicious Rosetta server send an unbounded response body causing memory exhaustion when json() is called at line 148, leading to client crashes and denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: new()] [URL Validation] Does the constructor validate that the provided URL address is a valid HTTPS endpoint, or can it accept HTTP URLs exposing transaction data and signatures to man-in-the-middle attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [Request Body Validation] At line 140, is there size limit validation on the serialized request body before sending, or can excessively large requests cause memory exhaustion or server-side DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Signature Malleability] At lines 845-850, does the signing process prevent signature malleability attacks where an attacker could modify the signature bytes while keeping it valid, potentially causing replay attacks or double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Private Key Exposure] Are private keys properly zeroized from memory after signing at line 845, or do they remain in memory where they could be leaked through memory dumps, swap files, or side-channel attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Signing Message Validation] At line 834, can an attacker manipulate the RawTransaction deserialization to produce a different signing_message than expected, causing users to sign unintended transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Key Reuse] Does the function prevent signing multiple transactions with the same private key concurrently, which could lead to nonce reuse vulnerabilities or signature correlation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Hex Encoding Validation] At line 834, does hex::decode properly validate input, or can malformed hex strings cause panic or incorrect byte interpretation leading to invalid signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Signature Type Enforcement] At line 849, is SignatureType::Ed25519 properly validated on the server side, or can an attacker submit a different signature scheme causing verification failures or security downgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: derive_account()] [Key Derivation] At lines 710-722, can an attacker provide a malicious public key that derives to a privileged system account address, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: get_account_address()] [Public Key Conversion] At line 640, does the try_into() conversion properly validate the public key format, or can malformed keys cause panics or derive to incorrect addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Sequence Number Manipulation] At lines 653-669, if sequence_number is None, can an attacker exploit race conditions to submit duplicate transactions with the same auto-generated sequence number, causing double-spending or transaction replay? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Gas Price Manipulation] At lines 654-656, if gas_unit_price is None, can a malicious Rosetta server suggest an unreasonably high gas price causing users to overpay or a too-low price causing transaction starvation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Gas Amount Overflow] At line 682, can max_gas_amount multiplied by gas_price_per_unit overflow u64 causing incorrect gas fee validation and potential fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Fee Validation Bypass] At lines 676-684, the fee validation uses >= instead of ==, allowing transactions with higher-than-expected gas costs to pass validation, potentially draining user funds through excessive fees. Can this be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Operation Parsing Mismatch] At line 693, the parse_not_same parameter allows operations to differ between input and parsed output.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unsigned_transaction()] [Operation Validation Skip] At lines 807-815, if parse_not_same is true, operation validation is skipped.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unsigned_transaction()] [Signer Injection] At lines 805-806, if account_identifier_signers is populated in an unsigned transaction, it's treated as an error. But is there any path where this check could be bypassed, allowing pre-signed authorization without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Signer Mismatch] At lines 873-882, signer validation requires exact match, but are the signers checked in the correct order, or can an attacker reorder signers to bypass multi-sig validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Missing Signer Check] At line 882, if account_identifier_signers is None, an error is returned. But could there be edge cases where this is not populated even for valid signed transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Amount Overflow] At line 189, can the amount parameter overflow during withdraw/deposit operations causing incorrect balances or unlimited minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Operation Ordering] At lines 203-218, the withdraw happens before deposit. Can an attacker exploit this ordering to cause a revert after withdrawal but before deposit, permanently locking funds? (Critical)"
