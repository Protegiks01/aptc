  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Format String] Are there format string vulnerabilities when Clone/Copy/Serialize traits interact with external logging backends that might interpret enum names as format specifiers? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [PII Leakage] Does logging full PeerNetworkId via Display trait expose validator identity information that should be anonymized for privacy, potentially enabling targeted attacks on specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [PII Leakage] Can the 'request_id' field be used to correlate and track individual peers across log exports, violating privacy expectations for peer monitoring data? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Misuse] When LogSchema is used in network.rs and lib.rs, can incorrect lifetime management cause dangling references if Error or PeerNetworkId objects are dropped before logs are flushed? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Misuse] Does the LatencyPing entry adequately distinguish between different ping types (initial, retry, health check), potentially conflating security-relevant latency measurements? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Misuse] Can the SendRequest entry be abused to log sensitive request parameters before proper authentication/authorization checks, leaking unauthorized request attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Validation] Does the lack of validation on request_type string allow arbitrary strings to be logged, potentially causing parsing errors in log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [DoS] Can attackers trigger rapid PeerPingError or InvalidResponse events to cause excessive log I/O, degrading validator node performance during consensus-critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [DoS] Does the LogAllPeerStates event cause expensive serialization of all peer state when triggered, allowing attackers to degrade performance by forcing frequent state logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [DoS] If the 'request' field holds large or deeply nested PeerMonitoringServiceRequest objects, can Debug formatting cause stack overflow or excessive CPU usage during logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Feature] Does the LogSchema lack cryptographic signatures or integrity checks, allowing compromised nodes to tamper with logs and hide malicious peer monitoring activities? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Feature] Is there no rate limiting or filtering on log events, allowing verbose logging during attacks to hide critical security events in noise? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Feature] Does the absence of log level fields (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) prevent proper prioritization of security-critical events like TooManyPingFailures? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Missing Feature] Is there no event type for detecting Byzantine behavior or protocol violations, causing such events to be logged under generic UnexpectedErrorEncountered? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Audit Trail] Does the LogSchema provide sufficient context for forensic analysis, or could critical fields (timestamp, node_id, authentication context) be missing when investigating security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Audit Trail] Can logs be retroactively modified or deleted without detection due to lack of append-only guarantees or tamper-evident logging mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Compliance] Does the peer monitoring logging satisfy compliance requirements for blockchain audit trails, or could missing log entries create gaps in security event reconstruction? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] If LogSchema::new() is called with a LogEntry variant but no corresponding event is set, do downstream log processors handle the incomplete schema gracefully or crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Edge Case] What happens if all Option fields remain None after construction - does this create an empty log entry that confuses monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Edge Case] Can concurrent modification of the PeerNetworkId or Error references during logging (via interior mutability patterns) cause torn reads or inconsistent log data? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Boundary] Are there integer overflow concerns if the same LogEntry type is logged billions of times, potentially causing metrics/counters to wrap? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Boundary] Does request_id being u64 prevent overflow, or could exhaustion of the U64IdGenerator cause duplicate request IDs leading to log correlation errors? (Low)"
