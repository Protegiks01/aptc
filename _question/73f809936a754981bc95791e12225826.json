  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unreachable code] Since args.run() contains an infinite loop in the processor, is the Ok(()) return on line 19 unreachable code that could hide logic errors if the service ever exits normally? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply chain attack] Can the imported crates (aptos_indexer_grpc_file_checker, aptos_indexer_grpc_server_framework, clap, jemallocator) be compromised through supply chain attacks to inject malicious code into the file checker? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Version pinning] Are the dependency versions properly pinned to prevent automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities or breaking changes in ServerArgs or IndexerGrpcFileCheckerConfig? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Transitive dependencies] Do the imported crates bring in vulnerable transitive dependencies (e.g., in cloud_storage, serde_json, tokio) that could be exploited during file verification operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Architecture] [Privilege escalation] Does the file checker run with elevated privileges that could be exploited if args.run() is compromised, allowing attackers to access or modify arbitrary files in cloud storage buckets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Architecture] [Service isolation] Is the file checker properly isolated from other indexer services, or can a compromise in main.rs be leveraged to attack other components like the file store or cache worker? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Architecture] [Credential management] Does ServerArgs::parse() and args.run() properly handle cloud storage credentials (for accessing existing_bucket_name and new_bucket_name) without exposing them in logs, core dumps, or error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Architecture] [Data integrity chain] If the file checker incorrectly verifies files due to a bug in main.rs's initialization logic, can this lead to corrupted transaction data being served to downstream indexer consumers, compromising blockchain state queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Platform] [Conditional compilation] Since jemalloc is only used on Unix systems (line 9), could non-Unix platforms (Windows) have different security characteristics or vulnerabilities in memory management? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Platform] [Build configuration] Can attackers exploit differences in debug vs release builds to bypass security checks, especially around the expect() panic behavior and allocator configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Observability] [Silent errors] Does main() provide sufficient logging and metrics before calling args.run() to detect when the service fails to start due to misconfiguration or cloud storage access issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/main.rs] [Observability] [Health checks] Is there a health check endpoint exposed before entering args.run() to allow orchestration systems to verify the file checker is operational and not stuck in initialization? (Low)"
