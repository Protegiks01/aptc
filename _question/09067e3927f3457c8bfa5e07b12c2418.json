  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [All parameters] [Gas parameter update consensus] When gas parameters are updated through governance, can race conditions during parameter loading cause validators to temporarily use different gas schedules, breaking consensus on transaction validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [from_on_chain_gas_schedule] [Partial update vulnerability] If an on-chain gas schedule update is partially applied (some parameters updated, others not), can this create inconsistent gas charging that breaks deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Abstract value unit parameters] [Memory accounting bypass] Can the per_abstract_value_unit costs be bypassed by structuring data in ways that minimize abstract value units while maximizing actual memory consumption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Event write operations] [Event memory leak] Can the event write costs fail to account for persistent event storage, allowing attackers to write unlimited events that cause validator disk space exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Object operations per_byte_loaded] [Lazy loading exploitation] Can the per_byte_loaded cost for objects be exploited by crafting objects that appear small initially but trigger large lazy-loaded data structures, bypassing proper gas accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [All parameters] [Governance manipulation] Can malicious governance proposals intentionally set gas parameters to zero or extremely low values to enable DoS attacks or economic exploits before the community can respond? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [All parameters] [Emergency parameter changes] Is there a mechanism to rapidly adjust gas parameters in response to discovered exploits, or would attackers have time to exploit mispriced operations before governance can update parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Version-gated parameters] [Coordinated version upgrade attack] Can attackers exploit the window during coordinated version upgrades where validators have mixed feature versions to execute transactions that are valid on some validators but invalid on others? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Line 103: multi_pairing_per_pair] [InternalGasPerArg type exploit] Can the InternalGasPerArg type for multi-pairing operations be exploited if the 'arg' count is not properly validated, allowing attackers to submit transactions claiming zero pairs to bypass gas charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Lines with InternalGasPerByte] [Byte count manipulation] For all InternalGasPerByte parameters, can attackers exploit edge cases where byte counts are measured inconsistently (e.g., UTF-8 vs byte length, compressed vs uncompressed) to bypass proper charging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Line 325: per_abstract_value_unit] [Abstract value unit calculation] Can the abstract value unit calculation be manipulated by structuring data with deeply nested references or circular structures that cause the unit counter to undercount actual memory usage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [All deserialization operations] [Malformed input DoS] For all deserialization operations (deser parameters), can attackers submit malformed data that passes initial validation but causes expensive deserialization failures after gas is charged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Serialization operations] [Serialization bomb] Can attackers craft data structures that serialize to enormous byte sizes due to expansion during serialization, bypassing per-byte gas charges calculated on pre-serialized size? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Multiple operation types] [Operation chaining DoS] Can attackers chain multiple cheap operations together (e.g., create_signer + multiple aggregator operations + event writes) to create a transaction that stays under gas limits but causes disproportionate resource consumption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Crypto operations + state operations] [Crypto-state interaction exploit] Can attackers combine expensive cryptographic operations with state storage operations in ways that cause validator CPU and I/O bottlenecks simultaneously, maximizing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Multiple hash functions] [Hash function confusion] Can attackers exploit semantic differences between hash functions (SHA2-512, SHA3-512, Keccak256, Blake2b) where the gas cost doesn't account for different security properties, enabling downgrade attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Line 71: algebra_ark_bn254_fr_one value of 0] [Zero gas constant operation] Why does the fr_one operation have a gas cost of 0? Can this be exploited to perform unlimited field element one constant operations for free, potentially as a building block for more complex attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/aptos_framework.rs] [Lines 38, 42, 47, etc: operations returning constants] [Constant operation cost imbalance] Can attackers exploit operations that return constant values (zero, one, identity, infinity, generator) with very low gas costs to construct complex computations where most operations are free constant retrievals?
