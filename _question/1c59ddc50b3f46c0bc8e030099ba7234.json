  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::StateSyncVersion] [State sync attack] Can StateSyncVersionChecker be manipulated to accept state sync from malicious or outdated nodes, potentially allowing state corruption or eclipse attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::StateSyncVersion] [Version rollback] Can an attacker configure StateSyncVersionChecker to allow older state sync protocol versions that may have known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Checker dependency] Are there implicit dependencies between checkers (e.g., NodeIdentity must pass before ConsensusProposals is meaningful) that could be violated by arbitrary checker ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Circular dependencies] Could certain checker configurations create circular dependencies where CheckerA needs results from CheckerB but CheckerB needs results from CheckerA, causing deadlocks or infinite loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Silent failure] If a checker constructor fails but the error is caught and ignored by calling code, can nodes bypass critical health checks without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Partial initialization] If build_checkers() returns an Err after successfully constructing some checkers, are those checkers properly dropped or could they continue operating in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Concurrent checking] The Checker trait requires Send + Sync - but if multiple checkers run concurrently against the same target node, can they interfere with each other causing false positives or negatives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Thread safety] If build_checkers() is called from multiple threads simultaneously, does the clone() operation on CheckerConfig create isolated instances or could shared state cause race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait Bounds: Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize] [Serialization attack] Can an attacker exploit Serialize/Deserialize implementations to persist malicious checker configurations that get loaded on node restart, bypassing runtime validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Configuration persistence] If CheckerConfig is serialized and stored, can an attacker modify the stored configuration file to disable critical checkers or change their parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: CheckSummary] [Score overflow] In CheckSummary::from() implementation, the score calculation sums u8 scores as u32 - can integer overflow occur if there are more than 16 million checkers, causing incorrect health assessments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: CheckSummary] [Division by zero] If check_results.len() is 0, CheckSummary returns a perfect score of 100 - can an attacker configure zero checkers to always get a perfect health score regardless of actual node state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: CheckSummary] [Score manipulation] The summary_score is a simple average - can an attacker add many dummy checkers that always return 100 to inflate the average score and mask critical failures in important checkers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Types: CheckResult] [Score bounds] CheckResult uses u8 for score (0-100) - is there validation that scores are within this range, or could checkers return values >100 causing arithmetic errors in aggregation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::BuildVersion+NodeIdentity] [Version/identity mismatch] Can a node pass BuildVersionChecker with a valid version but fail NodeIdentityChecker due to role mismatch, and is this combination properly detected as a critical failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::All Consensus Checkers] [Consensus health composite] If a node passes 2 out of 3 consensus checkers, is it considered healthy enough, or must all consensus-related checkers pass for true consensus participation validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Latency+MinimumPeers] [Network health composite] Can a node have low latency to a few peers (passing LatencyChecker) but have too few total peers (failing MinimumPeersChecker), and is this properly flagged as a network health issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Missing validation] Is there any validation that ensures at least one consensus-related checker is configured and required, or can all consensus checks be disabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Required enforcement] The 'required' field is just a boolean flag - where is it actually enforced, and can an attacker bypass enforcement by manipulating the checker execution flow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Empty configuration] Does build_checkers() reject an empty checker_configs slice, or can it successfully build zero checkers allowing nodes to have no health validation at all? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Duplicate checkers] Can the same checker type appear multiple times in checker_configs, and if so, do multiple instances interfere with each other or waste resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Memory leak] If any checker constructor allocates resources but then fails during initialization, are those resources properly cleaned up or could there be memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Heap exhaustion] If build_checkers() is called with an extremely large checker_configs slice, can the Vec<Box<dyn Checker>> accumulation exhaust heap memory before completion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Return: Vec<Box<dyn Checker>>] [Reference counting] Are Box<dyn Checker> instances properly reference counted, or could there be scenarios where a checker is dropped while still referenced elsewhere causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Panic unwinding] If a checker constructor panics during Box allocation, is the panic unwinding safe or could it leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)"
