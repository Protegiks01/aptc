  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [General: Information Disclosure] Do error messages across all functions consistently avoid leaking sensitive information like validator IPs, account balances, transaction details, or internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [General: Error Amplification] Can attackers trigger cascading errors by crafting inputs that generate many Error objects, potentially exhausting memory or causing DoS through error accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [General: Serialization] Does the Serialize implementation handle all edge cases safely, or can malformed Error structs cause serialization panics or produce invalid JSON? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Integration: Logging] Are error messages from this module properly sanitized before being logged, or can log injection attacks via malicious error messages corrupt audit logs or bypass log monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Integration: Monitoring] Can attackers trigger specific error patterns to evade monitoring systems or generate false positives that hide real attacks among noise? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Integration: Client Applications] Do error responses provide enough information for legitimate clients while avoiding excessive detail that aids attackers in reconnaissance or exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Struct: Error] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone trait implementation handle all fields safely, or can cloning Error objects with large messages or complex ledger versions cause performance issues or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Struct: Error] [PartialEq/Eq] Are the PartialEq and Eq implementations secure, or can attackers craft Error objects that compare equal despite having different security implications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Struct: Error] [Debug Trait] Does the Debug trait expose more information than Display, potentially leaking internal state when errors are debug-printed in development or test environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Field: aptos_ledger_version] [Skip Serialization] Does the skip_serializing_if attribute properly handle None values, or can attackers exploit the serialization logic to infer whether ledger version information is available? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Field: code] [Type Safety] Is the u16 type for code sufficient, or should it use a newtype pattern to prevent accidental mixing with other u16 values and ensure type safety? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: status_code()] [Error Code Confusion] Can the fallback to 500 error mask specific client errors, making it harder to distinguish between server failures and client mistakes in monitoring and debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [General: Resource Limits] Are there any limits on the number of Error objects that can be created, or can attackers exhaust memory by triggering massive numbers of errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [General: String Size] Is there a maximum length for error message strings, or can unbounded messages cause memory exhaustion when errors are accumulated or serialized? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: not_found()] [State Inference] Can the combination of 404 errors with specific ledger versions allow attackers to build a timeline of when resources appear or disappear from blockchain state? (Low)",
