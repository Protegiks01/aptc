  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_nil()] [Round validation] Is there validation that the round parameter (line 306) is greater than quorum_cert.certified_block().round() to ensure NIL blocks advance rounds properly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_nil()] [Failed authors requirement] Can NIL blocks be created with empty failed_authors vector when they should contain the current round's failed proposer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_nil()] [Epoch inheritance] NIL block inherits epoch from quorum_cert.certified_block() (line 316). Can this be exploited during epoch transitions to create NIL blocks in the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Empty BlockInfo] DAGBlock uses BlockInfo::empty() for both VoteData blocks (line 341). Can this create blocks without proper parent validation or state commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Empty QuorumCert] The QuorumCert is constructed with empty LedgerInfo and empty aggregated signature (lines 340-345). Does this bypass normal consensus validation for DAG blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Bitvec default] Uses BitVec::default() for AggregateSignature (line 344). Can this be exploited to claim signatures from validators who didn't actually sign? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Node digests validation] Are the node_digests (line 334) validated to correspond to actual DAG nodes, or can arbitrary hash values be included? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Parents bitvec size] Is parents_bitvec (line 333) validated to have the correct size matching the number of possible parents? Can oversized or undersized bitvecs cause issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Parent-block mismatch] Can parent_block_id (line 332) be different from the actual parents represented in parents_bitvec and node_digests, creating inconsistent parent references? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_for_dag()] [Epoch parameter trust] The epoch is passed as parameter (line 325) rather than derived from quorum_cert. Can this allow DAG blocks in incorrect epochs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Epoch derivation] Epoch is derived from quorum_cert.certified_block().epoch() (line 368). Can this be exploited during epoch transitions when the QC is from the previous epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Round regression] Is there validation that round (line 369) is greater than the quorum_cert's certified block round? Can proposals with decreasing rounds be created? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Timestamp regression] Is timestamp_usecs (line 370) validated to be >= quorum_cert's certified block timestamp? Can proposals go backwards in time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Author validation] The author parameter (line 361) is directly stored without validation. Can any account pretend to be a validator by setting arbitrary author values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Failed authors accuracy] Are the failed_authors (line 362) validated to be accurate, or can proposers manipulate this list to affect validator reputation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Payload validation] Is the payload (line 360) validated for size limits, transaction validity, or can arbitrary payloads be included? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal_ext()] [Validator txns authorization] Are the validator_txns (line 381) validated to ensure only authorized validators can include specific system transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal_ext()] [Validator txns limit] Is there a limit on the number or total size of validator_txns to prevent DoS through excessive system transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal_ext()] [ProposalExt version] ProposalExt::V0 is used (line 394). If future versions exist, can version confusion attacks downgrade to V0 to bypass security improvements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_proposal_ext()] [Epoch consistency] Like new_proposal, epoch is derived from quorum_cert (line 390). Can this create epoch inconsistencies during transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_from_opt()] [OptBlockData validation] When converting OptBlockData to BlockData (line 405), are all fields properly validated, or can malicious OptBlockData bypass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_from_opt()] [QuorumCert injection] The quorum_cert parameter (line 405) is added during conversion. Can this QC be mismatched with the OptBlockData's intended parent, creating inconsistent relationships? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_from_opt()] [Epoch consistency] OptBlockData's epoch (line 407) is used directly. Can this differ from the quorum_cert's epoch, creating cross-epoch inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_from_opt()] [Block body trust] The proposal_body from OptBlockData (line 411) is used directly in BlockType::OptimisticProposal. Can this contain malicious payloads or validator txns that weren't validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: is_reconfiguration_suffix()] [Reconfiguration detection] This delegates to quorum_cert.certified_block().has_reconfiguration(). Can false positives in reconfiguration detection cause blocks to be incorrectly treated as epoch boundaries? (High)"
