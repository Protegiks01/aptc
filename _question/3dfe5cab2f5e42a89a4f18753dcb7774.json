  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Firewall Bypass] If operators rely solely on the expose_identity_information flag without network-level access controls, can attackers bypass firewall restrictions to query this endpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Internal Network Exposure] Is the inspection service bound to 0.0.0.0 by default, exposing the identity_information endpoint to external networks even when intended for internal use only? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Validator Targeting] Can attackers use exposed validator peer IDs to specifically target validators with consensus-level attacks, message flooding, or spoofed consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Consensus Participation] Does exposing validator identity information enable attackers to map peer IDs to voting power and target high-stake validators to maximize impact on consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Eclipse Attack Enabler] By revealing all peer IDs, does this endpoint provide attackers with the exact information needed to execute eclipse attacks by blocking connections to specific validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Network Partition] Can knowledge of validator and fullnode peer IDs be used to plan network partitioning attacks that isolate validators and prevent consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Response Tampering] After constructing the response tuple (StatusCode, Body, String), can any intervening code modify the response before it's sent to the client? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Output Encoding] Does the text output use proper character encoding, or could non-ASCII characters in network_id or peer_id cause encoding issues or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Header Injection] Could specially crafted peer_id values containing HTTP headers or CRLF sequences enable HTTP response splitting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Audit Logging] Does the function log when identity information is accessed, and could attackers extract validator identities without leaving audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent attackers from continuously polling for identity information during key rotation or configuration changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Metrics Exposure] Does accessing this endpoint update any metrics that could be used for reconnaissance about node operation patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Testnet Configuration] Since ConfigOptimizer automatically enables expose_identity_information for non-mainnet chains, could testnet configurations accidentally migrate to mainnet with identity exposure still enabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [YAML Injection] Can attackers inject malicious YAML configuration to override expose_identity_information during config optimization, forcing identity disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can spoofing the chain_id during configuration loading bypass sanitization checks and enable identity_information on mainnet validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Operator Privacy] Does exposing validator peer IDs enable attackers to correlate validator identities with operator identities, physical locations, or other personally identifiable information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Network Fingerprinting] Can the specific combination of validator and fullnode networks exposed by this endpoint uniquely identify and fingerprint specific validator operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Historical Correlation] If attackers scrape this endpoint over time, can they build a historical database of validator identities and track validator set changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Stale Data] Does the function always return current identity information, or can caching or stale NodeConfig references cause it to return outdated peer IDs after key rotation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Inconsistent State] If validator_network and full_node_networks are updated at different times, can the endpoint expose inconsistent identity information during configuration updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Configuration Drift] Can discrepancies between the exposed identity information and the actual network state be exploited to confuse monitoring systems or enable attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Mainnet Exposure Risk] Since only expose_configuration is checked by ConfigSanitizer for mainnet validators, can mainnet validators run with expose_identity_information=true without warnings or errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Production Security] Are mainnet validators explicitly warned or prevented from exposing identity_information, or is it left to operator discretion with only default settings as protection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Migration Risk] When upgrading from testnet to mainnet, could leftover expose_identity_information=true settings from testnet configs cause accidental identity exposure on production validators? (High)"
