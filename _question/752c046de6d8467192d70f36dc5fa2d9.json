  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + RwLock] [RwLock deadlock] Can VaultStorage's RwLock<HashMap<String, u32>> for secret_versions cause deadlocks if get() and set() operations are called recursively or from multiple consensus threads? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + AtomicU64] [Token renewal race] Does VaultStorage's next_renewal AtomicU64 with Relaxed ordering provide sufficient synchronization guarantees, or can race conditions cause multiple simultaneous token renewal attempts? (Medium)",

  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault] [Vault unsealed check] Does VaultStorage's available() method fail safely when Vault is sealed, or can consensus operations continue with stale keys leading to safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: on_disk] [File permission] Does OnDiskStorage set appropriate file permissions (0600) when creating key storage files to prevent unauthorized local access to consensus private keys? (Critical)",

  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Line 5: #![forbid(unsafe_code)]] [Unsafe transitivity] Does forbid(unsafe_code) at the crate level prevent unsafe code in all submodules, or can individual modules re-enable unsafe operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: Ed25519PrivateKey] [Type newtype bypass] Can type conversions or trait implementations allow bypassing the type safety of Ed25519PrivateKey, enabling its use with incompatible cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: crypto_kv_storage + PrivateKey trait] [Key zeroization] Does Ed25519PrivateKey implement Drop to securely zero memory when keys are no longer needed, or do private keys remain in memory after deletion? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: Serialize + DeserializeOwned bounds] [Deserialization bomb] Can maliciously crafted serialized data exploit serde deserialization to cause excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption during key loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + Client] [Vault TLS validation] Does the VaultStorage Client properly validate TLS certificates including certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks when communicating with Vault servers? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + token] [Token transmission security] Are Vault authentication tokens transmitted securely and not logged in plaintext where they could be intercepted and used to access validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault] [Vault server trust] Does VaultStorage validate that it's communicating with a legitimate Vault server and not a malicious replacement that could serve backdoored keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_base64()] [Panic on invalid input] Does from_base64() properly handle all invalid base64 inputs without panicking, or can malformed input cause validator crashes during key deserialization? (Medium)",

  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: Error::KeyNotSet] [Error as oracle] Can an attacker use KeyNotSet errors as an oracle to enumerate which keys exist in storage by probing different key names? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + Error::InternalError] [Generic error handling] Does excessive use of InternalError hide specific failure modes that could help diagnose security issues or exploitation attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: CryptoStorage::sign()] [Message hashing] Does the sign() method properly hash messages using CryptoHash before signing, or can an attacker cause length extension attacks by providing pre-hashed data? (High)",
