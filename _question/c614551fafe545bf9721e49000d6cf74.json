  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Derive: Hash] [Hash collision] Can attackers craft identifiers that produce hash collisions to cause performance degradation in HashMap/HashSet lookups used for module resolution or storage key indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Equality consistency] Are Eq and Hash implementations consistent (a == b implies hash(a) == hash(b)), or can inconsistencies cause identifiers to be both equal and map to different hash buckets breaking invariants? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Derive: Ord, PartialOrd] [Ordering determinism] Is the Ord implementation deterministic across platforms and locale settings, or can different ordering cause validators to process modules/resources in different orders leading to state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [Compile-time bypass] Can the compile-time validation in the macro be bypassed through macro expansion tricks or nested macro invocations, allowing invalid identifiers to be created at compile time? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [Unsafe transmute] The macro uses unsafe transmute from &'static str to &'static IdentStr - can this transmute violate memory safety if the IdentStr representation changes or if there are alignment issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [Static lifetime assumption] Does the macro correctly enforce that only &'static str is accepted, or can shorter lifetimes be coerced causing dangling references when the IdentStr outlives the source string? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [Validation workaround] The macro uses array indexing with !is_valid to trigger compile errors - can this be bypassed through const evaluation tricks or compiler optimizations that eliminate the bounds check? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [RefCast assumption] The macro assumes IdentStr::ref_cast() is safe based on a const assertion - if the assertion is removed or the RefCast trait is implemented incorrectly, can the transmute cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Macro: ident_str!] [Macro hygiene] Can macro hygiene issues allow shadowing of $crate or other macro variables, causing the validation or transmute to operate on attacker-controlled types? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Storage keys] [Key injection] Since identifiers are used as storage keys, can invalid characters that pass validation (like '$') be exploited to inject separator characters that collide with system-generated keys causing unauthorized state access? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Storage keys] [Key normalization] If storage keys are normalized or processed differently than identifier validation assumes, can this discrepancy allow two different identifiers to map to the same storage key causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Storage keys] [Key length limits] Does storage backend enforce maximum key length limits that differ from identifier validation, potentially causing truncation of long identifiers and key collisions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Cross-module lookups] [Module path injection] Can identifiers containing special patterns be used to break out of module namespaces, allowing cross-module calls to unintended targets through path traversal-like attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Cross-module lookups] [Resolution ambiguity] Can similar-looking identifiers (differing only in case or special characters) cause module resolution ambiguity where different validators resolve to different modules? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Usage: Cross-module lookups] [Circular dependencies] Can specially crafted module identifiers create circular dependency chains that cause stack overflow or infinite loops during module loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Integration: Move VM] [Bytecode verification] Does the Move VM bytecode verifier re-validate all identifiers loaded from bytecode, or can pre-verified bytecode contain invalid identifiers that bypass runtime validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Integration: Move VM] [Gas metering] Are identifier validation operations properly gas-metered, or can attackers submit transactions with many invalid identifiers to cause DoS through excessive validation without paying proportional gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Integration: Move VM] [Type signatures] Can invalid identifiers in Move type signatures bypass type checking, allowing type confusion attacks that violate Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Security: Unicode] [Normalization bypass] The comments mention unresolved Unicode normalization issues - can attackers exploit NFD vs NFC normalization differences to create visually identical identifiers that hash/compare differently causing validator divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Security: Unicode] [Homoglyph attacks] Even with ASCII-only restriction, can visually similar characters (0/O, 1/l, rn/m) be used to create confusing identifiers that trick users or auditors into approving malicious contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Security: Unicode] [Future compatibility] If Unicode identifiers are added in the future, can existing code assumptions about ASCII-only identifiers cause security vulnerabilities when mixed with Unicode identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Concurrency: Thread safety] [Immutability guarantee] Does the Box<str> immutability guarantee hold under concurrent access, or can data races in unsafe code blocks mutate identifiers causing validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Concurrency: Thread safety] [Arc sharing] When Identifiers are shared across threads via Arc, can the hash implementation be called concurrently with mutations causing race conditions in hash table implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Concurrency: Thread safety] [Cache poisoning] If identifier validation results are cached, can race conditions in cache updates allow invalid identifiers to be cached as valid, bypassing subsequent validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Testing: Fuzzing] [Proptest strategy] Does the Arbitrary implementation for fuzzing test all edge cases including boundary conditions, empty strings, maximum lengths, and special characters? (Low)"
