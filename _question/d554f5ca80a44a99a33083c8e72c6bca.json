  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Cross-Client] [Context Confusion] If compression contexts are shared between client types, could state pollution from one client affect compression security for another client? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Cross-Client] [Resource Contention] Can an attacker cause resource contention by simultaneously maximizing compression load across all 6 client types to overwhelm compression infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Type Safety] [Unsafe Code] If unsafe code blocks interact with CompressionClient enum, could memory corruption lead to invalid enum discriminant values outside the defined variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Type Safety] [FFI Boundary] If CompressionClient crosses FFI boundaries to C/C++ compression libraries, are proper invariants maintained to prevent enum corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Type Safety] [Transmute] Could unsafe transmute operations elsewhere in the codebase cast invalid values into CompressionClient, bypassing Rust's type safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Configuration] [Client Limits] Are there per-client compression limits (max size, rate, concurrency) properly enforced for each of the 6 client types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Configuration] [Algorithm Selection] If different compression algorithms are used per client type, could algorithm confusion or downgrade attacks compromise security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Configuration] [Compression Level] Can attackers force high compression levels for specific client types to cause CPU exhaustion attacks on validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Error Handling] [Match Exhaustiveness] Is the match statement in get_label() exhaustive, or could future enum additions cause runtime panics if not all variants are handled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Error Handling] [Invalid Enum] If CompressionClient is constructed from untrusted input (e.g., network deserialization), is proper validation performed to reject invalid enum values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Safety] Could panics in compression code for specific client types cause validator crashes and consensus liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Downstream] [Client Trust] Do compression functions blindly trust the CompressionClient parameter, or is there validation that the caller is authorized to use that client type? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Downstream] [Label Validation] Are the string labels from get_label() validated before being used in metric names, file paths, or other security-sensitive contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Downstream] [Client Capabilities] Should different client types have different compression capabilities (algorithms, limits), and if so, are these enforced? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Supply Chain] [Dependency Confusion] Could malicious crates providing CompressionClient-compatible types be used to bypass security checks through type confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Cryptographic] [Compression Leakage] Does compression of encrypted or sensitive data for specific client types leak information about plaintext content through compression ratios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Determinism] [Compression Determinism] If consensus requires deterministic compression for reproducible state, can CompressionClient selection affect determinism and cause state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Compatibility] [Version Migration] When migrating between Aptos versions, could changes to CompressionClient enum variants cause compatibility issues or data loss? (Medium)"
