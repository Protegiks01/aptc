  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Static configuration] [Immutable after compile] Can legitimate configuration updates be deployed without recompiling the entire binary, or does the static include_str! force a full rebuild for any configuration change? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 20: ReleaseConfig::parse()] [Validation bypass] Does ReleaseConfig::parse() perform comprehensive validation of all proposal configurations, or could malformed proposals pass validation and later cause issues during execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Multiple unwrap() calls] [Panic safety] Are all unwrap() calls in this file guaranteed to succeed under normal conditions, or could edge cases in deployment environments trigger panics that halt the release builder? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Error propagation] [Silent failures] Do any of the path manipulation operations silently fail without panicking, potentially causing downstream issues in proposal generation that manifest as consensus or state corruption? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Static initialization] [Build-time vs runtime] Is there a clear security boundary between build-time configuration (include_str!) and runtime behavior, or could build-time compromises affect runtime security? (High)",
