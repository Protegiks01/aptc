  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Filter bypass] Can an attacker exploit the first-match-wins rule ordering to bypass deny rules by crafting transactions that match allow rules earlier in the list, potentially allowing unauthorized transactions to bypass security filters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Default allow vulnerability] Does the default allow behavior when no rules match create a security risk where incomplete filter configurations allow all transactions, potentially bypassing critical access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Empty filter bypass] Can an attacker exploit the empty filter check that returns true to bypass all filtering by forcing or manipulating the filter into an empty state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Rule precedence manipulation] If multiple rules could match a transaction, can an attacker predict and exploit the rule ordering to ensure a favorable outcome, bypassing intended deny rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: filter_transactions()] [Batch processing bypass] Can an attacker exploit the batch filtering logic to cause inconsistent filtering results across a set of transactions, potentially allowing some malicious transactions through while legitimate ones are blocked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: add_multiple_matchers_filter()] [Rule injection] Can an attacker manipulate the rule addition process to inject malicious allow rules that override existing deny rules through the mutable self modification pattern? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches() - TransactionMatcher::TransactionId] [Hash collision] Can an attacker craft a malicious transaction that produces the same committed_hash() as a whitelisted transaction ID, allowing unauthorized transactions to bypass ID-based filters through hash collisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches() - TransactionMatcher::TransactionId] [Transaction replay] Does the TransactionId matcher properly prevent replay attacks, or can an attacker reuse a previously allowed transaction hash to bypass filters after the transaction was executed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches() - TransactionMatcher::TransactionId] [Hash preimage attack] Can an attacker pre-compute transaction hashes to find allowable transaction IDs before submitting transactions, bypassing ID-based access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_sender_address()] [Sender spoofing] Can an attacker bypass sender-based filters by manipulating the transaction sender field before signature verification, potentially impersonating authorized senders? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_sender_address()] [Account rotation bypass] If an account undergoes authentication key rotation, can transactions from the old key bypass sender filters that were configured for the rotated address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches() - TransactionMatcher::Sender] [Null address bypass] Can an attacker use special addresses like 0x0 or system addresses to bypass sender-based filtering rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function_module_address()] [Payload type confusion] Can an attacker bypass module address filters by switching between different payload types (Script, EntryFunction, Multisig, EncryptedPayload) that may have inconsistent address extraction logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function_module_address()] [ModuleBundle bypass] Does the function return false for ModuleBundle payloads, allowing module deployment transactions to bypass module address filters entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function_module_address()] [EncryptedPayload decryption failure] Can an attacker craft malformed encrypted payloads where executable_ref() fails, causing the filter to return false and allow the transaction through by default? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function_module_address()] [Empty executable bypass] Does the TransactionExecutableRef::Empty case correctly handle empty payloads, or can attackers use empty executables to bypass module address filtering?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: compare_entry_function_module_address()] [Module address spoofing] Can an attacker craft entry functions that appear to call one module address but actually call another through reflection or indirection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function()] [Function name case sensitivity] Are function and module name comparisons case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass filters by using different casing (e.g., 'Transfer' vs 'transfer')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: compare_entry_function()] [String normalization bypass] Can an attacker bypass entry function filters using Unicode normalization tricks, whitespace manipulation, or similar string encoding issues?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: compare_entry_function()] [Module name length limit] Are there any length limits on module_name and function_name strings that could cause truncation or comparison failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/transaction_filter.rs] [Function: matches_entry_function()] [Script payload bypass] Does returning false for Script payloads mean all script transactions bypass entry function filters, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution? (High)",
