  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply chain attack] Could the shadow_rs crate dependency be compromised to inject malicious code during build time that gets embedded into validator binaries, potentially allowing remote code execution on all nodes running the affected build? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build metadata manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the build environment to cause shadow_rs::new() to embed false version information or git commit hashes, potentially causing validators to misidentify their software version during consensus or upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency confusion] Is there validation that the shadow_rs crate being used is the authentic version from crates.io, or could an attacker use dependency confusion attacks to substitute a malicious shadow-rs package? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Error handling] Does the build script properly handle failures from shadow_rs::new(), or could a malicious build environment cause silent failures that result in binaries with missing or corrupted metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build determinism] Could variations in build-time metadata generated by shadow_rs cause non-deterministic builds, potentially leading to validators running binaries with identical code but different metadata that could affect consensus or verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Information disclosure] Does the metadata embedded by shadow_rs expose sensitive information about the build environment (paths, user info, internal infrastructure) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Version spoofing] Can an attacker modify the git repository state before building to cause shadow_rs to embed incorrect commit hashes, allowing malicious validator binaries to masquerade as official releases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build script execution] Since build scripts run with full system privileges during cargo build, could a compromised shadow_rs crate perform arbitrary filesystem operations, network requests, or environment manipulation during the build process? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Transitive dependencies] Are the transitive dependencies of shadow_rs audited for security vulnerabilities, or could a compromise in a deep dependency tree affect the Aptos build process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build reproducibility] Does the use of shadow_rs prevent reproducible builds by embedding timestamps and other environment-specific data, making it impossible to cryptographically verify that distributed binaries match the source code? (Medium)"
