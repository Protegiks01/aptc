  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_compiler_to_stderr()] [Color choice] Line 81 uses ColorChoice::Auto - can terminal detection bugs cause security-relevant errors to be formatted incorrectly and missed? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Imports: logging setup] [Logging configuration] Line 94 calls setup_logging(None) - can logging configuration affect compilation behavior or introduce side channels? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Pipeline ordering: type safety] [Check sequencing] The pipeline runs checks in specific order (unused -> recursive -> access -> inlining -> acquires -> lambda -> closure) - can reordering these checks cause security-critical properties to be missed? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Pipeline ordering: reference safety] [Safety timing] Reference safety is checked both in check pipeline (line 523) and optimization pipeline (line 560) - can code changes between these checks introduce reference safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Pipeline ordering: abilities] [Ability timing] Ability checks run after optimization (lines 574-577) - can optimizations create ability violations that weren't present before? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Experiments: USAGE_CHECK] [Feature gate] Line 332 gates unused variable/parameter checks behind USAGE_CHECK - can production code have this disabled, allowing unused parameter bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Experiments: RECURSIVE_TYPE_CHECK] [Feature gate] Line 343 gates recursive type checking - can disabling this in production allow DoS through infinite type recursion? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Experiments: SEQS_IN_BINOPS_CHECK] [Version dependent] Line 369 makes this check version-dependent - can V2.0+ code exploit unchecked side effects? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Experiments: LINT_CHECKS] [Feature gate] Lines 377 and 541 gate lint checks - can production disable lints that catch security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/lib.rs] [Experiments: CMP_REWRITE] [Version dependent] Line 388 makes comparison rewriting version-dependent - can rewriting introduce bugs in V2.2+? (Medium)",
