  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Performance] [Memory allocation] Does the transformation allocate excessive temporary memory for large functions, potentially causing OOM during compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Testing] [Correctness] Are there comprehensive tests verifying that coalesced bytecode is semantically equivalent to original bytecode for all edge cases? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Testing] [Fuzzing] Has this transformation been fuzzed with randomly generated valid Move bytecode to find corner cases where coalescing is unsound? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Testing] [Cross-validator] Are there tests confirming that different validator implementations produce identical coalesced bytecode from the same source? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Testing] [Regression] If bugs are found in coalescing, could they affect already-deployed Move modules, and is there a mechanism to disable this optimization for compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Type confusion] Could incorrect coalescing of locals with different Move types (even if same Rust Type) cause type confusion attacks where attackers manipulate values of one type as another? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Resource leakage] For Move resources that must be consumed or explicitly dropped, could coalescing cause resources to leak or be double-consumed? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Timing attacks] Could the coalescing transformation introduce timing differences in bytecode execution that enable timing side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Consensus divergence] If coalescing is non-deterministic, could different validators produce different bytecode, causing consensus failures and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Malicious modules] Can an attacker craft Move source code that exploits coalescing bugs to produce bytecode that crashes the VM, causes OOM, or executes with incorrect semantics? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/variable_coalescing.rs] [Security] [Optimization bypass] Could certain Move code patterns reliably bypass coalescing, allowing attackers to force compilation of inefficient bytecode that consumes excessive resources? (Low)"
