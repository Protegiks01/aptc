  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Crypto: HashValue] [Hash Preimage] Can attackers who can write to EventAccumulatorSchema inject preimage attacks by storing hash values they've precomputed, allowing them to construct fake Merkle proofs for arbitrary events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Crypto: HashValue] [Collision Resistance] If the hash function used for event accumulators has weaknesses, can attackers find collisions that allow them to substitute different events with the same accumulator hash? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Byzantine: Equivocation] [Double Events] Can Byzantine validators create two different event accumulators for the same transaction version by manipulating EventAccumulatorSchema writes, causing different honest validators to see different events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Resource: Storage] [Database Growth] Can an attacker trigger excessive writes to EventAccumulatorSchema by emitting many events, causing unbounded database growth that fills validator disk space and causes node crashes?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Resource: Memory] [Cache Bloat] Can repeated queries to EventAccumulatorSchema cause validator nodes to cache excessive event accumulator data in memory, leading to OOM crashes? (Medium)",
