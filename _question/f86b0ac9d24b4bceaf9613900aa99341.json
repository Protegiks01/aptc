  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Module visibility] Are all 15 submodules (block_metadata_transactions, coin_models, events, etc.) intended to be publicly exported, or could restricting visibility of sensitive modules prevent unauthorized direct access to internal indexer data structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Module organization] Does the public export of all model modules create an overly broad API surface that could expose internal implementation details to external consumers, potentially leading to tight coupling and making future security patches more difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Access control] Since all modules are declared as 'pub mod', can external crates directly instantiate database models like signatures, transactions, or events without going through proper validation layers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Missing modules] Are there any critical indexer data models that should be included but are missing from this declaration list, potentially causing incomplete indexing of blockchain state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Module dependencies] Does the lack of explicit dependency ordering or initialization sequence in these module declarations create potential for race conditions or initialization order issues when these models are first loaded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Namespace pollution] Could the public export of 15 different model modules lead to naming conflicts or confusion in consuming code, potentially causing developers to use the wrong model type and introduce security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Version compatibility] If individual submodules (like v2_objects) represent different schema versions, does the flat export structure prevent proper version isolation that could lead to mixing incompatible data model versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/mod.rs] [Circular dependencies] Could the interdependencies between exported modules (e.g., transactions depending on events, signatures, write_set_changes) create circular dependency risks that might cause compilation issues or runtime initialization problems? (Low)"
