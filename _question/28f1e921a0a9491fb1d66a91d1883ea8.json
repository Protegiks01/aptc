  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [Edge case] [Reason 0xFFFF] Can reason value 0xFFFF (maximum for 16 bits) conflict with future error codes or cause matching failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [Edge case] [Unmatched category/reason] Can category/reason combinations that don't match any defined constants bypass all validation by hitting default cases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [Edge case] [VMStatus variant exhaustion] Are all possible VMStatus variants handled in convert_prologue_error(), convert_epilogue_error(), and expect_only_successful_execution(), or can new variants bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [Edge case] [AbortLocation variants] Can non-Module AbortLocation variants (e.g., Script) bypass the is_account_module_abort() checks and inject malicious errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [Edge case] [Empty message] Can None values for error messages cause null pointer issues or bypass error handling in consuming code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [DoS] [Error logging flood] Can attackers trigger excessive error logging through speculative_error! and speculative_warn! macros to fill disk space or slow down validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [DoS] [String formatting cost] Can extremely long error messages in format! macros at lines 101, 146, 193, 205, 222, 254 cause CPU exhaustion during error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [DoS] [Repeated error conversions] Can attackers cause repeated error conversions through transaction retries to exhaust validator CPU resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [State consistency] [Speculative execution errors] Can SPECULATIVE_EXECUTION_ABORT_ERROR and DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR be exploited to commit inconsistent state across validators during Block-STM parallel execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [State consistency] [Prologue/epilogue mismatch] Can differences in error handling between prologue and epilogue cause some validators to accept and others to reject the same transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [State consistency] [Non-deterministic errors] Can error conversions produce non-deterministic results across validators, causing consensus failures and network splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/errors.rs] [State consistency] [Error categorization race] Can race conditions in parallel transaction execution cause different validators to categorize the same error differently? (High)"
