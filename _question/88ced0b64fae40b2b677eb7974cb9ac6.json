  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Format string injection] The output uses format! macros - if peer IDs or network IDs contain special characters, can they break the output format? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Validator identification] Can an attacker use the validator_network presence check to definitively identify which nodes are validators for targeted attacks? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: get_peer_information()] [Performance DoS] The function sorts all peers multiple times and performs numerous iterations - can an attacker with many peer connections cause this function to consume excessive CPU time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: get_peer_information()] [Memory exhaustion] The function builds a large Vec<String> with detailed information for each peer - with thousands of peers, can this cause excessive memory allocation?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_peer_connection_metadata()] [JSON serialization vulnerability] Connection metadata is serialized using serde_json::to_string with unwrap_or_default - what happens if serialization fails due to malicious data in connection metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_trusted_peers()] [Validator set exposure] The function exposes the complete validator set and seed peers - can attackers use this to identify all validators for coordinated attacks or to plan Sybil attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_trusted_peers()] [BTreeMap sorting overhead] Trusted peers are copied into a BTreeMap for sorting - with large validator sets, can this cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_peer_monitoring_metadata()] [Debug format leak] Detailed metadata uses Debug formatting {:?} - can this leak sensitive internal state that should not be exposed? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_state_sync_metadata()] [Data client exposure] The function calls aptos_data_client methods that may perform expensive operations - can repeated requests cause performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Function: display_internal_client_state()] [Internal state leak] This exposes internal_client_state which may contain sensitive operational data - what attack vectors does this enable? (High)",
