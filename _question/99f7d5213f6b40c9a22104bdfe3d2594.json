  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [All constants] [Governance bypass] Can the hardcoded nature of these constants prevent proper governance-based protocol upgrades, forcing risky hardforks to modify gas parameters or consensus settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Gas constants] [Emergency response limitations] If gas limits need emergency adjustment due to attacks, does the hardcoded constant structure prevent quick response, allowing attacks to continue? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Conditional compilation] [Test coverage gaps] Can the 50x difference in MAX_GAS_AMOUNT between test and production modes cause critical bugs to only appear in production, evading test coverage? (High)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [GAS_UNIT_PRICE test/prod] [Free transaction exploitation] Can attackers exploit test networks (with GAS_UNIT_PRICE = 0) to develop and refine attack vectors that are economically infeasible to test in production? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [DEFAULT_BUCKETS] [Monitoring blind spots] Do the DEFAULT_BUCKETS values create observability gaps where certain transaction gas ranges are not properly monitored, allowing attacks to hide in these gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [DEFAULT_BUCKETS] [Metric overflow] Can transactions with gas usage above the maximum bucket value (1000000) cause metric collection to fail or overflow, disabling monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [adjust_gas_headroom] [Saturating arithmetic semantics] Does reliance on saturating_mul and saturating_div mask potential overflow conditions that should be treated as errors, allowing invalid gas calculations to proceed? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [GAS_HEADROOM ratio] [Ratio accuracy] Can the integer ratio 3/2 be insufficient for certain transaction types, causing systematic under or overestimation of gas requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [adjust_gas_headroom] [Monotonicity violation] Is the adjust_gas_headroom function guaranteed to be monotonic (larger gas_used produces larger output), or can certain input combinations violate this property? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Line 10: forbid(unsafe_code)] [Unsafe bypass] Although unsafe_code is forbidden in this module, can other modules that import these constants use unsafe code to modify them via memory manipulation, bypassing the prohibition? (High)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Constant references] [Memory corruption] Can malicious code obtain mutable references to these constants through unsafe transmutation in other modules, modifying supposedly immutable values? (High)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [DEFAULT_BUCKETS slice] [Buffer overflow] Can code consuming DEFAULT_BUCKETS slice access out-of-bounds indices, causing crashes or memory corruption in validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [All constants] [Dependency confusion] Can attackers create malicious crates with similar names that export conflicting global-constants, causing build systems to link against attacker-controlled values? (High)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Module imports] [Transitive dependency attack] Can malicious dependencies of modules that import global-constants intercept or modify these values during compilation or linking? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [All string constants] [String encoding attack] Can attackers exploit assumptions about UTF-8 encoding in CONSENSUS_KEY, OWNER_ACCOUNT, or other string constants to inject null bytes or special characters that corrupt storage systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Storage constant strings] [Case sensitivity] Can inconsistent case handling in storage systems (treating 'consensus' vs 'CONSENSUS' differently) allow attackers to create shadow storage entries that bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [adjust_gas_headroom] [Concurrent modification] Although constants are immutable, can concurrent calls to adjust_gas_headroom on shared mutable state (using these constants) cause data races in transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [All constants] [Cache coherency] On multi-core systems, can inconsistent caching of these constant values cause different CPU cores to see different values, breaking transaction determinism? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Gas constants] [Protocol ossification] Do hardcoded gas constants prevent the protocol from adapting to changing network conditions, hardware improvements, or attack patterns, creating long-term security risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [All constants] [Version mismatch] Can validators running different versions of this file (with different constant values) participate in the same network, causing subtle consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [CONSENSUS_KEY] [Post-quantum vulnerability] Does the simple string identifier for CONSENSUS_KEY prevent migration to post-quantum cryptographic schemes, creating long-term security risk? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [Cryptographic constants] [Algorithm agility] Can the hardcoded nature of key constants prevent cryptographic algorithm agility, making it impossible to quickly respond to cryptographic breaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [adjust_gas_headroom] [Input validation] Does adjust_gas_headroom validate that gas_used <= max_possible_gas before computation, or can invalid inputs cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: config/global-constants/src/lib.rs] [adjust_gas_headroom] [Return value range] Is the return value guaranteed to be in range [0, max_possible_gas], or can arithmetic edge cases violate this invariant? (Medium)",
