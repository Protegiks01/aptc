  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Concurrency] [Read-write race] Can a thread reading in_flight_request at line 56 race with another thread writing it at lines 63 or 71, and does Rust's type system prevent data races here despite no explicit synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Concurrency] [Multiple writers] If multiple threads call record_response_failure() simultaneously, can the += operation at line 103 lose updates due to non-atomic read-modify-write, undercounting failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Concurrency] [Visibility] Without explicit memory ordering, can updates to last_request_time at line 66 become visible to other threads in a different order than updates to in_flight_request at line 63? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Rust] [Move semantics] When RequestTracker is moved (not cloned), are the Option<Instant> fields properly moved, or could there be use-after-move bugs in calling code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Rust] [Borrow checker] Can the mutable methods like request_started() at line 61 be called while an immutable reference exists from get_last_request_time(), and does the borrow checker properly prevent this? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Rust] [Option unwrapping] Does any calling code improperly unwrap() the Option<Instant> values returned by get_last_request_time() or get_last_response_time() without checking, causing panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Logic] [Semantic gap] Does the tracker properly distinguish between 'request failed to send' vs 'request sent but response failed', and should these be tracked separately for accurate peer reputation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Logic] [Incomplete state] Should the tracker also record the reason for failure (timeout vs. invalid response vs. network error) to enable more intelligent peer management decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/request_tracker.rs] [Logic] [Missing metrics] Does the tracker lack any mechanism to track success rate over time windows rather than just consecutive failures, which could miss intermittently malicious peers? (Low)"
