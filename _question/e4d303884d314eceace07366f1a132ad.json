  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [State Storage] [Historical Queries] When querying historical state, can validators retrieve wrong AptosVersion for past epochs due to incorrect state versioning, causing state proof verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Consensus] [Byzantine Version Proposal] Can Byzantine validators (<1/3) propose blocks with incorrect version metadata that passes consensus checks but causes execution failures when honest validators try to apply feature gates? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Consensus] [Version Disagreement] If validators disagree on current AptosVersion due to desynchronized on-chain config fetches, can this cause them to validate same transaction differently, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Consensus] [Quorum Certificate] Do quorum certificates include version information, or can version changes between QC generation and block execution cause validators to apply wrong feature gates to committed blocks? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Consensus] [Liveness Impact] Can failed version updates or stuck epoch transitions due to version validation errors cause the network to lose liveness and halt consensus progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Consensus] [Safety Rule] Do AptosBFT safety rules account for version changes during voting, or can version updates between proposal and vote cause validators to violate safety rules? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Transaction Validation] [Prologue Version Check] Do transaction prologue functions fetch fresh AptosVersion from state or use cached values, and can stale cache allow transactions to bypass version-gated validation? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Transaction Validation] [Gas Metering] Can version changes affect gas metering calculations, and does gas calculation properly account for version to prevent exploitation across version boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Transaction Execution] [VM Version Mismatch] Can the Move VM execute transactions using different version than what transaction validation used, causing transactions that should fail validation to execute successfully? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Parallel Execution] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent transactions see different AptosVersion values if version update happens mid-block, causing non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Transaction Validation] [Mempool Acceptance] Can transactions enter mempool under one version but execute under different version after epoch change, causing mempool to accept invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Type Safety] [Version Type Confusion] Can the u64 major field be confused with other u64 types in the codebase (like ledger version or transaction version), causing incorrect version comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone Implementation] Does the derived Clone implementation create deep copies of AptosVersion, or can shallow copies cause aliasing issues where modifying one version affects another? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Memory Safety] [Struct Layout] Can struct padding or alignment issues in AptosVersion cause different memory layouts across platforms, leading to serialization incompatibilities between validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Type Safety] [Const Safety] Are the version constants APTOS_VERSION_2/3/4 properly immutable, or can const mutation vulnerabilities allow runtime modification of these values? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Memory Safety] [Send/Sync Bounds] Does AptosVersion properly implement Send/Sync traits for thread safety, and can concurrent access to version data cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [REST API] [Version Exposure] Does the REST API expose AptosVersion information, and can this information leak be exploited to fingerprint validators or plan attacks timed to version transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [RPC Interface] [Version Manipulation] Can RPC calls that query current version return manipulated data if the on-chain config fetch fails, causing clients to operate under wrong version assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [SDK Integration] [Client Version Checks] Do SDKs validate that their supported protocol version matches chain's AptosVersion before submitting transactions, or can version mismatch cause transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Indexer] [Version Tracking] Can indexers that track protocol version get out of sync with chain's actual version, causing them to misinterpret transactions and provide incorrect data to users? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Version] Can the version ever be set to 0, and does this cause undefined behavior in version comparison logic that assumes positive version numbers? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Version] What happens if version reaches u64::MAX - does the next increment overflow to 0, and is this overflow properly detected and prevented? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Edge Case] [Uninitialized Version] During genesis or chain initialization, can AptosVersion be left uninitialized or default-initialized to 0, causing all feature gates to fail? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Edge Case] [Rapid Version Changes] Can rapid successive version updates through multiple governance proposals in short time cause epoch transition logic to fail or validators to miss version updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/on_chain_config/aptos_version.rs] [Edge Case] [Same Version Update] What happens if governance tries to set version to same value as current version - does this cause unnecessary reconfiguration or is it properly rejected? (Low)"
