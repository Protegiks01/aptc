  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Overall design] [Script cache uniqueness] Scripts are cached by key without version control - if two transactions use same script hash but different bytecode (hash collision), can this cause non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Overall design] [Parallel cache usage] In Block-STM parallel execution, multiple transactions access the same caches concurrently - can cache line contention, false sharing, or lock contention cause unpredictable performance degradation affecting consensus timing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: from_deserialized(), lines 26-31] [Extension injection] ModuleCode::from_deserialized() accepts arbitrary Arc<E> extension - can malicious extensions contain code that executes during cache operations, allowing arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: from_arced_verified(), lines 38-44] [Arc reference counting] from_arced_verified() takes Arc<VC> directly - can an attacker maintain Arc references externally and modify the pointed-to data after caching, bypassing cache immutability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: code(), lines 46-49] [Reference lifetime] code() returns &Code with lifetime tied to ModuleCode - can this reference outlive the cache entry if the entry is evicted or replaced, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: extension(), lines 51-54] [Extension lifetime] extension() returns &Arc<E> - if extensions have Drop implementations with side effects, can cache eviction trigger unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Struct: VersionedModuleCode, lines 152-158] [Default version semantics] new_with_default_version() uses V::default() - what if the default version isn't actually the lowest/storage version? Can this cause version ordering confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: into_module_code(), lines 171-173] [Arc unwrapping] into_module_code() returns Arc<ModuleCode> - if multiple threads hold Arc references, can one thread's modifications affect others' views of the cached code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: version(), lines 176-178] [Version clone cost] version() clones the version - if Version is a large complex type, can repeated version() calls during hot paths cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Impl: Clone for VersionedModuleCode, lines 186-196] [Clone semantics] Cloning VersionedModuleCode clones Arc and version - but does this preserve the exact state, or can concurrent modifications between clone and use cause inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: empty(), lines 222-226, 377-381] [Initial capacity] Both empty() constructors create unbounded structures - should there be initial capacity hints to avoid rehashing during validator startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/module_cache.rs] [Function: into_modules_iter(), lines 229-234] [Iterator consumption] into_modules_iter() consumes self - if called accidentally during active execution, can this cause validators to lose their entire module cache? (High)",
