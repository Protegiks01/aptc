  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Field: chan_size] [Memory Pressure] During high transaction load, can a chan_size that is too small cause log message drops, losing critical evidence of Byzantine behavior or security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Field: is_async] [Async Logging Failure] If async logging fails (e.g., channel full), does the system have fallback mechanisms, or can critical consensus errors be silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Fields: enable_telemetry_*] [Telemetry Exfiltration] When telemetry is enabled, what prevents sensitive validator metadata (IP addresses, peer info, stake amounts) from being logged and sent to remote telemetry services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Field: telemetry_level] [Level Escalation] Can telemetry_level be dynamically escalated at runtime without proper authentication, allowing attackers to increase log verbosity and cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Field: tokio_console_port] [Unauthenticated Access] Does the tokio console port implement any authentication, or can anyone on the network connect to it and observe validator internal async task states, potentially revealing consensus timing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Struct: LoggerConfig, Field: tokio_console_port] [Production Exposure] If tokio_console_port is accidentally left enabled in production (not None), can this create a debug interface that exposes validator operational details to attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Function: randomize_ports()] [Port Prediction] If randomize_ports() uses weak randomness, can attackers predict the assigned tokio console port and connect to it before legitimate monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Overall File] [Determinism Impact] Can different LoggerConfig settings across validators (e.g., different log levels) cause observable timing differences that violate consensus determinism assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/logger_config.rs] [Overall File] [Debugging Overhead] If some validators enable enable_backtrace and others don't, can this cause performance asymmetry that affects proposal generation timing and validator rewards? (Low)"
