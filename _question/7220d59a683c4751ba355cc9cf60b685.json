  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Integration] [Quorum certificate chaining] Does VoteProposal validate that the block's quorum cert properly chains to previous certified blocks, or can orphaned QCs be used? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Edge case] [Empty block voting] Can VoteProposal be created for a block with zero transactions, and does this properly handle the accumulator proof with empty leaves? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Edge case] [Genesis block handling] For the genesis block (version 0), does VoteProposal handle the absence of a parent accumulator root correctly, or can this cause verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum version overflow] If the accumulator version reaches u64::MAX, can version increment in vote_data_with_extension_proof() cause integer overflow and version number wraparound? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Edge case] [Accumulator root collision] If two different transaction sets produce the same accumulator root hash (collision), can this cause vote confusion where validators vote on different blocks with same state ID? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Edge case] [NIL block voting] Does VoteProposal support NIL blocks (empty blocks for liveness), and if so, are they handled correctly in proof verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Rust] [Lifetime issues] Do the reference getters (accumulator_extension_proof, block, next_epoch_state) have appropriate lifetimes that prevent use-after-free when VoteProposal is dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Rust] [Panic in production] Can any of the functions panic (e.g., unwrap, expect, index out of bounds) instead of returning Result, causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Rust] [Send/Sync safety] Is VoteProposal properly Send+Sync for cross-thread usage in async consensus code, or can unsound Send implementations cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Rust] [PhantomData issues] Does the AccumulatorExtensionProof use PhantomData correctly for the hasher type, or can type confusion lead to using wrong hash functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Protocol] [Double voting] Can a validator create multiple VoteProposals for different blocks at the same round and vote on all of them, violating consensus safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Protocol] [Equivocation detection] Does VoteProposal contain enough information for other validators to detect and prove equivocation (conflicting votes at same round)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Protocol] [Timeout certificate bypass] Can VoteProposal be used to vote on blocks that should be rejected due to timeout certificates indicating the round should advance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Protocol] [Fork choice violation] Can validators create VoteProposals that vote on forks that violate the fork choice rule (longest chain or highest QC), causing chain splits? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Byzantine] [Selective proposal] Can a Byzantine leader send different VoteProposals to different validators (with different accumulator proofs), causing honest validators to vote on different states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Byzantine] [Proof withholding] Can a Byzantine validator create a VoteProposal with a valid-looking proof but withhold the actual transaction data needed for other validators to verify execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Byzantine] [Computation DoS] Can a Byzantine validator craft VoteProposals with proofs that are very expensive to verify (many leaves, deep tree), slowing down honest validators? (High)",
