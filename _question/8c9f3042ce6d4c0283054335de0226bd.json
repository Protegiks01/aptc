  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Once-cell violation] Multiple 'set_X_once()' calls at lines 657-661 - if any of these functions are called more than once (e.g., in test scenarios), do they panic, silently ignore, or cause state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration inconsistency] num_shards is set at line 657, but execution_threads_per_shard is set at line 658 - can race conditions between these two settings cause threads to be assigned to non-existent shards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Security downgrade] At lines 650-656, skip_paranoid_checks disables paranoid_type_checks - can this flag be abused to hide bugs or vulnerabilities that would otherwise be caught by these checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [V2 feature risk] At line 661, blockstm_v2 can be enabled - if this is an experimental feature, can enabling it in benchmarks produce results that don't match production behavior, misleading performance analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Profiler lifecycle] At lines 663-677, profiler handlers are created but cpu_start and mem_start are underscored (unused) - can early drops of these guards cause profiling to stop prematurely, hiding performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource leak] Profiler start/end at lines 672-677 and 711-716 - if the benchmark panics between start and end, are profiling sessions properly cleaned up, or do they leak resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type dispatch] At lines 679-709, different executor types are dispatched via match - can type confusion between NativeParallelUncoordinated variants with different RawTransactionExecutor types cause memory safety issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Platform-specific code] At lines 703-706, Linux-specific thread configuration is set for PtxExecutor - can running this on non-Linux systems cause undefined behavior or silent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Profiler path injection] At line 715, the hardcoded path './target/release/aptos-executor-benchmark' is used - can this path traversal allow writing profiler output to arbitrary locations if the working directory is manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Global: ALLOC] [Allocator confusion] The global allocator is set to jemalloc at lines 52-54 only on Unix - can this cause memory allocator mismatches if code assumes a different allocator, leading to double-frees or corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Global: START_TIME] [Race condition] The START_TIME lazy static at lines 58-59 uses unwrap() on register_int_gauge!() - can registration failures or race conditions during initialization cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: Opt] [Default value risks] Multiple parameters have default values (e.g., block_size=10000, transactions_per_sender=5) - can these defaults create resource exhaustion if users don't explicitly set them for large-scale benchmarks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: Opt] [Conflict handling] At line 318, conflicts_with_all is used for hotspot_probability - but is the conflict checking exhaustive? Can other parameters also conflict and cause logical inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: Opt] [Parameter interactions] connected_tx_grps at line 312 has special behavior when non-zero (ignores transactions_per_sender) - can edge cases where connected_tx_grps >= block_size cause transaction generation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: ShardingOpt] [Address validation] remote_executor_addresses at line 208 accepts Vec<SocketAddr> - is there validation that these addresses are reachable, not localhost when remote is expected, or not pointing to privileged ports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: ShardingOpt] [Coordinator confusion] coordinator_address at line 210 is optional - can scenarios where it's None but remote_executor_addresses is Some cause coordinator election failures or split-brain scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: ShardingOpt] [Float precision] load_imbalance_tolerance at line 220 is f32 with default 2.0 - can very small values (e.g., 0.0001) or very large values (e.g., 1000000.0) cause partitioner logic to degenerate or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Enum: BlockExecutorTypeOpt] [Executor mismatch] Can selecting NativeNoStorageParallelUncoordinated (which ignores storage at line 295) combined with storage_opt.enable_storage_sharding=true create configuration contradictions that corrupt benchmark results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Enum: BlockExecutorTypeOpt] [Performance misleading] NativeValueCacheParallelUncoordinated at lines 288-290 uses cached in-memory state - can benchmarks using this produce unrealistically high TPS numbers that misrepresent actual production performance?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Enum: BlockExecutorTypeOpt] [State divergence] AptosVMParallelUncoordinated at lines 280-281 executes all transactions on the beginning-of-block state - can this cause state divergence from the actual AptosBFT execution model, invalidating benchmark results?
