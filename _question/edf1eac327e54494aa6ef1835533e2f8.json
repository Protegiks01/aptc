  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_proposal_scripts()] [File Overwrite Attack] Does the code check if proposal script files already exist before writing, or can an attacker trigger overwrite of existing files by crafting conflicting proposal names?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Atomic Write Violation] Does save_config() perform atomic file writes to prevent corruption if the process is interrupted mid-write, or can partial writes lead to invalid configs that break the governance system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_proposal_scripts()] [Filename Sanitization] Are proposal script filenames properly sanitized to prevent null byte injection, control characters, or other special characters that could cause filesystem errors or security issues?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade()] [Endpoint Spoofing] Can an attacker spoof the remote endpoint during validate_upgrade() to return fake validation results, making malicious proposals appear valid when they're not? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_and_equals()] [Client State Manipulation] When client is None, fetch_and_equals() returns false - can an attacker exploit scenarios where the client is intentionally set to None to bypass all on-chain validation checks?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: wait_until_equals()] [Time-Based Race Condition] The function polls with 1-second intervals up to time_limit - can an attacker exploit this polling window to temporarily serve correct configs during validation but revert to malicious configs afterward? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade()] [Timeout Manipulation] The MAX_ASYNC_RECONFIG_TIME is 60 seconds - can an attacker cause artificial delays to exhaust this timeout and make legitimate proposals fail validation, causing governance disruption?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade() - FeatureFlag] [Incomplete Validation] The validation only checks enabled and disabled flags - can an attacker add new feature flags or modify flag metadata without triggering the validation checks?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: consolidated_side_effects()] [Feature Flag Squashing Logic] When squashing multiple FeatureFlag entries, can an attacker exploit the squash() function to create feature flag states that are impossible to achieve through normal governance?
