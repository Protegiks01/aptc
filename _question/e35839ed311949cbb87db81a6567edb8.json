  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Memory exhaustion] [Histogram buckets] Does the default histogram bucket configuration for HISTOGRAM and RESPONSE_STATUS create too many buckets, consuming excessive memory under high request volume? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Memory exhaustion] [Time series explosion] Can an attacker cause time series explosion by generating unique combinations of labels across all metrics, exceeding Prometheus's time series limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Resource leak] [Metric cleanup] Are old metric time series properly garbage collected, or can stale label combinations accumulate indefinitely causing memory leaks over long-running service lifetimes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Dependency: aptos-metrics-core] [Supply chain] Can vulnerabilities in the aptos-metrics-core dependency (lines 5-8) be exploited through metric operations to compromise the faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Dependency: once_cell] [Initialization bug] Can bugs in the once_cell crate's Lazy implementation (line 9) cause race conditions, double-initialization, or memory corruption during metric setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Import: RejectionReason] [Type safety] Can changes to the RejectionReason struct definition in endpoints module (line 4) break type safety assumptions in bump_rejection_reason_counters, causing runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] If metric recording fails (e.g., due to registry errors), are failures silently ignored, potentially hiding critical monitoring gaps that mask attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Error handling] [Panic propagation] Can panics in metric recording code propagate to request handlers, causing request failures that impact legitimate faucet users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Edge case] [Empty labels] Can empty strings or whitespace-only strings be passed as label values, creating invalid metrics that break Prometheus scraping? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Edge case] [Unicode handling] Are unicode characters in label values (method, operation_id, status) properly handled, or can they cause encoding issues in metric export? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Privacy] [PII leakage] Can operation_id labels in HISTOGRAM (line 15) inadvertently include personally identifiable information like IP addresses or user IDs, violating privacy requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Privacy] [Correlation attacks] Can combining multiple metrics (HISTOGRAM, RESPONSE_STATUS, REJECTION_REASONS) allow an attacker to correlate requests and de-anonymize users of the faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Information disclosure] [Business logic inference] Do the detailed metrics expose enough information about faucet internal logic, rate limits, and validation rules to allow attackers to reverse-engineer bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Information disclosure] [Attack surface mapping] Can an attacker use metric endpoint queries to enumerate all possible operation_ids, rejection reason codes, and status codes, mapping the faucet's complete attack surface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Monitoring blind spot] [Missing metrics] Are there critical security events (e.g., authentication failures, balance depletion warnings) that should be tracked but are missing from this metrics file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Alert fatigue] [False positives] Can metric flooding attacks cause excessive counter increments that trigger false alerts, desensitizing operators to real security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Metric accuracy] [Clock skew] Can system clock skew or NTP issues cause histogram bucket timing to be inaccurate, hiding performance degradation attacks? (Low)"
