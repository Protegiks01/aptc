  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Serialization Information Leak] When BaselineConfiguration is serialized back to JSON/YAML (e.g., for diagnostics/logging), does it properly redact sensitive fields like public_key or cookie_store, or can internal state be leaked through debug endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [DNS Rebinding] If NodeAddress URL contains a domain name that resolves to one IP during configuration load but changes to an attacker-controlled IP later, can this enable DNS rebinding attacks where health checks are redirected to malicious servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_name] [Unicode Normalization] If configuration_name contains Unicode characters with different normalization forms, can an attacker create visually identical but distinct configuration names that bypass uniqueness checks or cause display confusion in operator interfaces? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Memory Safety] Since the struct contains Vec<CheckerConfig> which are later converted to Box<dyn Checker>, can incorrect lifetimes or memory management in the checker instantiation process cause use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: runner_config] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker configure retry_delay_secs to specific values that, when multiplied by num_retries, create predictable timing patterns allowing them to infer when specific health checks fail and timing-based side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Zero Value Attack] Can an attacker set CommonProviderConfig fields to zero (check_delay_secs=0, cache_ttl_ms=0) causing undefined behavior like division by zero in duration calculations or providers that never cache anything leading to performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Configuration Inheritance] If multiple configuration files are loaded sequentially, does the system properly isolate them, or can later configurations inherit or override fields from earlier ones in unintended ways causing configuration confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Protocol Downgrade] If NodeAddress URL initially uses HTTPS but an attacker can modify it to HTTP after loading, can this enable protocol downgrade attacks where subsequent health check communications occur over unencrypted channels? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Checker Dependency Violation] Do checkers have implicit dependencies (e.g., HandshakeChecker requires NoiseProvider which needs public_key in node_address), and can attackers craft configurations violating these dependencies causing runtime panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Serde Feature Attack] Does the system use serde features like serde_yaml::from_reader with unbounded input, allowing attackers to provide configurations with billions of entries causing memory exhaustion before deny_unknown_fields validation occurs? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_id] [SQL Injection] If configuration_id is used in database queries (e.g., for storing health check results) without parameterization, can an attacker inject SQL commands through specially crafted configuration IDs to compromise the backend database? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Metrics Endpoint Abuse] Can an attacker configure metrics provider settings to repeatedly query expensive metrics endpoints (e.g., /metrics with high cardinality) at high frequency, using the NHC service to DoS baseline node metrics infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Partial Deserialization] If deserialization fails midway (e.g., invalid checker config), does the system properly clean up partially initialized state, or can this leave dangling resources like open network connections from node_address? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Cookie Injection] Since NodeAddress contains a cookie_store (Arc<Jar>), can an attacker pre-populate the configuration with malicious cookies that get sent to the baseline node, potentially hijacking admin sessions or bypassing authentication? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Checker Configuration Overflow] Can individual CheckerConfig variants contain fields with extreme values (e.g., LatencyChecker with target_latency_ms=u64::MAX) that overflow when converted to Duration or cause arithmetic exceptions in checker logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Concurrent Modification] If the configuration is reloaded while health checks are running, are there proper locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access to the BaselineConfiguration fields causing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: runner_config] [Retry Storm] Can an attacker configure num_retries and retry_delay_secs such that failed checkers create cascading retry storms that overwhelm both the NHC service and baseline nodes with exponentially increasing load? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Redirect Following] If the HTTP clients built from NodeAddress automatically follow redirects, can an attacker configure a baseline URL that redirects health checks to arbitrary endpoints, bypassing intended network boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Version Skew] If different parts of the system expect different versions of the BaselineConfiguration schema (e.g., after upgrades), can this cause deserialization failures or security checks to be silently skipped due to missing fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_name] [Resource Exhaustion] If configuration_name is stored in memory for each health check result and never cleaned up, can an attacker provide extremely long names (up to String capacity) causing cumulative memory leaks over time? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Provider Configuration Mismatch] Can an attacker configure provider_configs that conflict with checker requirements (e.g., disabling system_information provider but enabling HardwareChecker) causing runtime errors that crash the health check service? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Debug Information Leak] Since the struct derives Debug, if configuration objects are logged in production with sensitive node_address URLs or public keys, can attackers access logs to discover internal network topology or cryptographic material? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Type-Based Checker Selection] Does the system properly validate that only one instance of each CheckerConfig variant exists, or can attackers provide multiple configurations of the same type with conflicting settings causing undefined evaluation behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [IPv6 Handling] If NodeAddress URL contains IPv6 addresses, are they properly validated and sanitized, or can attackers inject IPv6 addresses that bypass network security policies or exploit parser vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Configuration File Race] If configuration files can be hot-reloaded, can an attacker win a race condition by modifying files during the read operation causing partial or corrupted configurations to be loaded? (Medium)"
