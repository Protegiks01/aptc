  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/type_loader.rs] [Ability system] [Key ability forgery] Can Key ability be incorrectly granted allowing types to masquerade as account resources, enabling unauthorized access to account state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/type_loader.rs] [Ability system] [Ability inheritance bug] Does AbilityInfo::generic_struct() correctly compute inherited abilities from type arguments, or can ability escalation occur through nested generics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/type_loader.rs] [Function types] [Higher-order bypass] Can function types with incorrect ability flags be used to bypass Move's capability system in higher-order functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/type_loader.rs] [Function types] [Argument count mismatch] Can Function type with mismatched args/results counts pass type conversion and cause runtime crashes when invoked? (High)",
