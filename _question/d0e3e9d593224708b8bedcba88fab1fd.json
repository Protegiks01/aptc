  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: SparseMerkleLeafNode::hash()] [Hash computation] Does the hash() implementation at lines 121-129 use a domain separator to distinguish leaf hashes from internal node hashes, preventing second preimage attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Trait: CryptoHash for SparseMerkleLeafNode] [Hasher type] Can the SparseMerkleLeafNodeHasher be substituted with a malicious implementation to break the cryptographic properties of the tree? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: SparseMerkleLeafNode::hash()] [Update order] Does updating state with key first (line 126) then value_hash (line 127) provide collision resistance, or can attackers find (key1, value1) and (key2, value2) pairs with the same hash? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize for SparseMerkleLeafNode] [Serialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious serialized data that deserializes into a SparseMerkleLeafNode with inconsistent key/value_hash relationships? (High)",

  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Module: exports] [Type exposure] Do the public exports at lines 14-21 expose internal proof types that should remain private, allowing attackers to construct invalid proof structures? (Medium)",

  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: verify_transaction_info()] [Version edge case] What happens when transaction_version is 0 and ledger_info.version() is also 0 - does the inequality check at line 48 handle genesis correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: verify_transaction_info()] [Version overflow] If ledger_info.version() wraps around from u64::MAX to 0, can future transactions appear older than the ledger state? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: MerkleTreeInternalNode::hash()] [Hash output size] Does the hasher guarantee a fixed output size, or could variable-length outputs cause tree structure ambiguity? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: SparseMerkleLeafNode::hash()] [Hash collision birthday attack] With 256-bit hashes, are birthday attack complexities properly analyzed for the expected number of leaves in production? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Struct: MerkleTreeInternalNode] [Zero hash handling] What happens when left_child or right_child is HashValue::zero() - does this create degenerate subtrees or validation bypass opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: verify_transaction_info()] [LedgerInfo trust] Does the function assume ledger_info is already validated by consensus, or should it independently verify the ledger_info signature and BFT proof? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Function: verify_transaction_info()] [TransactionAccumulatorProof trust] Who constructs the ledger_info_to_transaction_info_proof, and can untrusted parties provide malicious proofs? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Type: TransactionAccumulatorInternalNode] [Hasher consistency] Are TransactionAccumulatorHasher instances consistent across all validators, or can hasher variations cause different accumulator roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/proof/mod.rs] [Type: SparseMerkleInternalNode] [State tree integrity] Does SparseMerkleInternalHasher match the hasher used in AptosDB storage layer, preventing state root mismatches? (Critical)",
