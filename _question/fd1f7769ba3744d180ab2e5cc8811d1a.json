  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: ModuleCache] [Access Control] Can external code bypass intended encapsulation by directly accessing the re-exported ModuleCache trait instead of going through proper validation layers, potentially allowing unvalidated module insertion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: SyncModuleCache] [Concurrency] Does the public re-export of SyncModuleCache allow multiple concurrent threads to insert conflicting module versions without proper synchronization, potentially causing state inconsistency across parallel execution paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: UnsyncModuleCache] [Thread Safety] Can the public availability of UnsyncModuleCache be misused in multi-threaded contexts where SyncModuleCache should be enforced, leading to data races and undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: ScriptCache] [Cache Poisoning] Does the re-exported ScriptCache interface allow attackers to insert malicious scripts that bypass verification, since the insert methods are publicly accessible? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Lines 8-12] [Feature Flag] Can the 'testing' feature flag be accidentally or maliciously enabled in production builds, exposing mock_deserialized_code, mock_verified_code, and mock_extension which could allow arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Test Export: MockDeserializedCode] [Type Confusion] If testing features leak into production, can MockDeserializedCode be used to create fake modules that appear verified but contain malicious bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Test Export: MockVerifiedCode] [Verification Bypass] Does the public export of MockVerifiedCode under test/feature conditions allow attackers to bypass the bytecode verifier by directly instantiating mock verified code? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: Code enum] [Type Confusion] Can the Code<D, V> enum be instantiated with incompatible deserialized and verified types, causing type confusion when modules transition between states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: WithHash trait] [Hash Collision] Does the WithHash trait re-export allow modules to be inserted with colliding hashes, potentially enabling module replacement attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: WithName trait] [Name Collision] Does WithName allow modules with identical names but different content to coexist in cache, leading to execution of wrong module versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: WithBytes trait] [Bytecode Tampering] Can WithBytes trait be implemented to dynamically modify returned bytecode, causing non-deterministic execution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Re-export: WithSize trait] [Size Mismatch] Does WithSize implementation allow reporting incorrect sizes, potentially causing memory allocation vulnerabilities or gas calculation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Module: cache] [Cache Coherency] Can the public exposure of both module_cache and script_cache submodules lead to inconsistent state if they're not properly synchronized during parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Module: errors] [Error Handling] Do the re-exported error macros (module_storage_error, module_linker_error, module_cyclic_dependency_error) properly sanitize input addresses and names to prevent error message injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/mod.rs] [Module: storage] [Storage Interface] Can the ModuleBytesStorage trait be implemented incorrectly to return inconsistent results across calls, breaking deterministic execution guarantees? (High)",
