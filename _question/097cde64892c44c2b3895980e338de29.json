  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: FullRandMetadata::new()] [Block-Metadata Mismatch] Can an attacker create FullRandMetadata where the embedded RandMetadata (epoch/round) does not match the actual block's epoch/round, causing confusion in randomness verification logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: FullRandMetadata] [Timestamp Ordering] Can validators with skewed system clocks provide timestamps that violate causal ordering, allowing randomness from round N+1 to appear earlier than round N, breaking temporal consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: round()/epoch()] [Accessor Consistency] The accessor methods expose inner metadata fields - can concurrent modifications to FullRandMetadata cause race conditions where round() and epoch() return inconsistent values within the same call context? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Seed Optionality] The seed field is Option<Vec<u8>> - can blocks with seed=None be accepted and cause on-chain contracts expecting randomness to fail or use fallback values that compromise security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [OnChainConfig Deserialization] As an OnChainConfig, can crafted on-chain state cause deserialization failures when PerBlockRandomness is fetched, halting all randomness-dependent operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Epoch-Round Mismatch] Can PerBlockRandomness have epoch/round values that don't match the current block's actual epoch/round, causing validators to use stale or future randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Seed Size Attack] Can the seed Vec<u8> grow unbounded during on-chain updates, causing storage bloat and making PerBlockRandomness queries increasingly expensive, leading to DoS on randomness-dependent contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Module Identifier] The MODULE_IDENTIFIER is 'randomness' - can name collisions with other on-chain modules cause PerBlockRandomness to be overwritten or shadowed, breaking randomness availability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: WVUF] [Implementation Switch] WVUF is aliased to PinkasWUF - can switching implementations (e.g., to BlsWUF) without migrating existing keys cause type confusion where old keys are used with new cryptographic algorithms, breaking verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: SKShare] [Secret Key Share Leakage] Can the SecretKeyShare type be accidentally serialized or logged through debug traits, exposing validator secret key shares to attackers who can then forge randomness contributions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: ProofShare] [Proof Share Malleability] Can ProofShare values be modified slightly without invalidating signatures, allowing Byzantine validators to create multiple valid-looking shares that influence aggregation outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: ASK/APK] [Augmented Key Validation] Are ASK (augmented secret key) and APK (augmented public key) validated for consistency during RandKeys construction, or can mismatched pairs cause verification to pass with incorrect keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: Delta] [Delta Manipulation] Can the Delta value used in WVUF operations be manipulated during transmission, causing honest validators to compute incorrect augmented keys that fail to verify against Byzantine validators' shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: Evaluation] [Evaluation Tampering] Can the final Evaluation output be tampered with after WVUF derivation but before storage in Randomness struct, allowing attackers to bias randomness while maintaining valid proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: WvufPP] [Public Parameters Substitution] Can Byzantine validators substitute malicious WVUF public parameters that appear valid but allow them to predict or bias randomness outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [All Structs] [BCS Serialization] Can non-canonical BCS encodings of any struct (RandMetadata, Randomness, etc.) bypass equality checks or cause same logical values to hash differently, breaking consensus on randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [All Structs] [Hash Collision] Do the Hash trait implementations for RandMetadata and Randomness properly include all security-critical fields, or can attackers craft colliding metadata that maps different epochs/rounds to the same hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [All Structs] [Equality Bypass] Can the PartialEq implementations be exploited where structurally different but logically equivalent values are treated as equal, allowing replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: add_certified_apk()] [Return Value Confusion] The function returns anyhow::Result<()> but always returns Ok(()) - can callers incorrectly assume success guarantees that don't exist, leading to logic bugs where uncertified keys are used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Clone Safety] Is RandKeys marked as Clone, and if so, can cloning the ASK secret key create multiple copies that violate key uniqueness assumptions, enabling key compromise through side channels? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [DKG Transcript Manipulation] RandKeys assumes keys come from DKG transcript of last epoch - can attackers manipulate the transcript during epoch transition to inject weak or known keys that compromise randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Threshold Assumption] Does RandKeys validate that the number of certified_apks meets the Byzantine threshold (2/3+1), or can attackers prevent certification of enough keys to halt randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: ProofShare] [Share Aggregation Attack] Can Byzantine validators contribute invalid ProofShares that pass individual verification but cause the aggregated proof to be invalid or biased toward attacker-chosen values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [VUF Output Verification] Does storing raw randomness bytes without the corresponding proof allow validators to later dispute the randomness value, causing fork disagreements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Public Key Share Ordering] Does the pk_shares vector maintain consistent ordering across all validators, or can order mismatches cause verification failures where honest shares are rejected? (High)"
