  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 11] [Macro expansion] Can parse_macro_input panic on malformed input, causing denial of service during the build process and preventing validator nodes from being compiled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Overall] [Compilation DoS] Can extremely large enums with thousands of variants cause exponential code generation, leading to compiler resource exhaustion and preventing builds of critical security patches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 29-46] [Type confusion] Can enums with variants wrapping different integer types (u32, u64, usize) generate conversions that cause integer truncation or overflow when converted on different architectures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 30-34] [Unsafe coercion] If enum variants wrap types containing raw pointers or unsafe types, can the generated From implementation perform implicit unsafe coercions that violate Rust's safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 36-45] [Repr compatibility] Can this macro be applied to enums with #[repr(C)] or #[repr(transparent)] attributes, potentially generating conversions that violate FFI safety or memory layout guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 15] [Generic capture] Does the generics capture properly handle all generic parameters including lifetime parameters, or could missing lifetime bounds in generated code cause use-after-free vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 30, 36] [Generic propagation] Are generic parameters properly propagated to both From and TryFrom implementations, or could phantom type parameters cause type system holes allowing invalid conversions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 29-46] [Trait bounds] Does the generated code inherit all trait bounds from the enum definition, or could missing Send/Sync bounds allow thread-unsafe conversions in concurrent blockchain contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Overall] [Validator messages] If used for validator-to-validator message enums, can type confusion between message variants allow a Byzantine validator to impersonate consensus messages from honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 36-45] [Transaction envelopes] If applied to transaction type enums, can failed conversions cause transaction execution to continue with default or zero values instead of properly rejecting invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Overall] [State synchronization] Can enum conversions introduce non-determinism if the wrapped types have non-deterministic trait implementations (Hash, Eq), causing state divergence across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 29-46] [Gas metering] If used for gas metering message types, can incorrect enum conversions bypass gas accounting allowing transactions to execute beyond their gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 20-22] [Empty enums] Can enums with zero variants pass validation and generate code that causes match exhaustiveness errors at compile time in dependent code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 27-49] [Single variant] Does the macro handle enums with exactly one variant correctly, and could this special case cause issues with pattern matching or type inference in generated code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 28] [Field access] Can the fields.unnamed.first() access fail silently on tuple enums with special internal representations, generating incomplete or incorrect conversion code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 24-26] [Field count validation] Could enums with complex field structures (tuples, arrays) be misinterpreted by the len() check, allowing multi-field variants to generate incorrect single-field conversions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Overall] [Version compatibility] During protocol upgrades, can newly added enum variants in consensus messages cause old validators using this macro to reject valid messages, creating a network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 40-42] [Backward compatibility] Does the catch-all error pattern properly handle enum variants added in newer protocol versions, or will it cause permanent incompatibility requiring emergency hard forks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-enum-conversion-derive/src/lib.rs] [Overall] [Migration safety] Can the generated conversions be safely changed during protocol upgrades without causing deserialization failures of persisted state in AptosDB? (High)",
