  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/transaction_fee.rs] [Function: generate_fee_distribution_proposal()] [No proposal ID] The generated proposals have no unique identifier. Can this cause confusion when multiple proposals are submitted, making it impossible for voters to distinguish between proposals with identical burn_percentage but submitted by different parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/transaction_fee.rs] [Function: generate_fee_distribution_proposal()] [Closure scope] The closure at line 26 captures function_name and burn_percentage. Can an attacker exploit Rust closure semantics or lifetime issues to cause use-after-free or dangling reference bugs if the closure is not executed immediately? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/transaction_fee.rs] [Function: generate_fee_distribution_proposal()] [Result unwrap] Callers of this function must handle Result<>. Can an attacker cause panic in calling code by triggering error paths that aren't properly handled, causing DoS in proposal generation tools or governance infrastructure? (Low)"
