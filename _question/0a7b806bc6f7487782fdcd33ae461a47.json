  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Testing gap] [Concurrent access tests] Are there tests verifying thread-safety of encode/decode operations under concurrent access, or could race conditions exist that aren't caught by single-threaded tests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Testing gap] [RocksDB integration tests] Do tests verify the schema's behavior when integrated with actual RocksDB operations (writes, reads, seeks, compaction), or only test encoding in isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [DoS] [Mass epoch boundary writes] Can an attacker trigger excessive epoch boundary writes by rapidly forcing epoch transitions (through governance attacks or validator manipulation), exhausting disk space in RocksDB and causing database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [DoS] [Decode performance attack] Can an attacker craft specially designed encoded data that causes decode_key() or decode_value() to consume excessive CPU time (e.g., through repeated ensure_slice_len_eq checks), slowing epoch lookups during consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [DoS] [Seek operation flooding] Can flooding the system with epoch lookup requests cause excessive seek_for_prev() operations on EpochByVersionSchema, degrading RocksDB performance and causing consensus timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Edge case] [Empty database] If EpochByVersionSchema has no records (empty database), how does get_epoch() behave - does it safely return an error, or could it cause panics or undefined behavior when seeking for non-existent epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Edge case] [Single epoch boundary] With only one epoch boundary record, can seek_for_prev() correctly identify both the first epoch and epochs after the boundary, or could off-by-one errors cause incorrect epoch detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Edge case] [Adjacent version boundaries] If two epoch boundaries are written at consecutive versions (V and V+1), does the encoding guarantee they remain distinct in RocksDB, or could compaction merge them causing loss of the intermediate epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Attack vector] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Between checking epoch boundaries and using the epoch data for consensus decisions, could the underlying RocksDB data be modified (by another thread or Byzantine actor), causing TOCTOU race conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Attack vector] [Epoch replay attack] If an attacker can rewrite historical epoch boundaries to earlier values, could they cause validators to replay old consensus rounds with outdated validator sets, enabling double-signing or equivocation? (Critical)"
