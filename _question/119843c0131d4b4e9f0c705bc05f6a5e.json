  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Function: request_captcha()] [Content Type] Is the Binary response properly tagged with the correct image content-type header, or could this cause client-side interpretation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Function: request_captcha()] [Captcha Farming] Can attackers request thousands of captchas and solve them in parallel using OCR/ML to build up a pool of valid captcha solutions for later abuse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Function: request_captcha()] [Replay Attack] If captcha keys are not time-limited, can an attacker solve a captcha once and replay the key/value pair indefinitely to bypass protection? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Function: request_captcha()] [No Expiration] Is there any mechanism to expire old captcha challenges, or do they remain in memory indefinitely until validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Function: request_captcha()] [Single Use Validation] After a captcha is validated once, is it immediately deleted from the HashMap to prevent reuse, or could there be a window for double-spending? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Struct: CaptchaApi] [Arc Safety] Is the Arc<Mutex<CaptchaManager>> properly synchronized across all potential access patterns, or could there be unsafe concurrent modifications? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/captcha.rs] [Line: 37] [Schema Validation] Does the OpenAPI schema correctly describe the u32 response header type, and could mismatches cause client-side parsing errors? (Low)",
