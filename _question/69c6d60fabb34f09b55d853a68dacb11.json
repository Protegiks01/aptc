  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [All native registrations] [Integer Overflow in Gas] Can the gas cost calculations (26*len, 62*len) overflow when given extremely large input sizes, causing gas undercharging and enabling DoS attacks with incorrectly metered operations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Framework Address Substitution] If the diem_framework_addr is changed during a protocol upgrade, are the native bindings properly reinitialized, or can old bindings persist causing calls to stale implementations and creating security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Module Name Spoofing] Can malicious Move modules use the same names (DiemAccount, Signature, Account) as the framework to intercept native calls intended for system modules, potentially hijacking critical operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 44: make_table_from_iter] [Address Binding Verification] Does make_table_from_iter enforce that only modules at diem_framework_addr can bind to these natives, or can modules at other addresses register conflicting native implementations causing VM confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 20, 25, 30, 35, 40: Arc::new wrappers] [Concurrent Access] When multiple transactions execute in parallel using Block-STM, can concurrent calls to the same Arc-wrapped native function cause race conditions in shared state within the native implementations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Static Initialization] Is the natives array initialized only once per VM instance, or can repeated calls to all_natives() create multiple copies causing memory leaks or stale function pointers being executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 12: Arc usage] [Reference Counting Attack] Can an attacker manipulate reference counts on the Arc-wrapped functions through repeated native calls or VM resets, potentially causing use-after-free vulnerabilities when function pointers are dereferenced? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [All native registrations] [Type Confusion] If Move module declarations for these native functions have mismatched signatures compared to the Rust implementations, can type confusion vulnerabilities allow attackers to pass incorrect argument types causing memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [All native registrations] [Argument Count Mismatch] Do the debug_assert checks in the native implementations properly validate argument counts at runtime, or can production builds with assertions disabled allow incorrect argument counts causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [All native registrations] [Return Value Safety] Can native functions return invalid Value objects (e.g., incorrect types, corrupted data) that violate Move's type safety guarantees when returned to Move code causing type system breaches? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 34-36: ed25519_verify registration] [Timing Attacks] Does the signature verification implementation use constant-time comparisons, or can timing side-channels leak information about private keys or message contents to attackers monitoring execution time?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 29-31: ed25519_validate_pubkey registration] [Canonical Encoding] Does public key validation enforce canonical encoding of Ed25519 points, or can multiple encodings of the same key bypass duplicate detection allowing attackers to create multiple accounts with the same underlying key? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 34-36: ed25519_verify registration] [Fault Injection] Can attackers exploit hardware faults or environmental conditions to cause signature verification to incorrectly return true for invalid signatures, potentially through bit flips or voltage glitching on validator hardware? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Line 23-26: destroy_signer registration] [Replay Attack Vector] Since destroy_signer must remain for replaying old transactions, can attackers craft new transactions that maliciously use this deprecated function to cause inconsistencies between replayed historical state and newly executed state? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Version Skew] If native function implementations are updated but the registration table remains unchanged, can version mismatches between function signatures and implementations cause ABI violations during transaction execution?
