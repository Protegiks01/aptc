  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious config_path containing '../' sequences to read arbitrary files outside the intended configuration directory, potentially exposing private keys from /opt/aptos/etc/mint.key or other sensitive validator credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Symlink Attack] Does the File::open() call at line 18 follow symbolic links, allowing an attacker to create a symlink from the config path to sensitive files like /etc/shadow or validator private keys, causing these to be parsed and logged? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between validating the config file exists and reading it, where an attacker could swap the file with malicious content after validation but before execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the File::open() at line 18 have size limits, or can an attacker provide a path to an extremely large file (e.g., /dev/zero or multi-GB YAML) causing memory exhaustion and faucet service crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Special File Access] Can an attacker specify special files like /dev/random, /proc/self/mem, or named pipes as config_path, causing the validation process to hang indefinitely or read unexpected system data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Struct: ValidateConfig] [Path Injection] Does the config_path field at line 13 properly sanitize or validate the PathBuf input to prevent null bytes, control characters, or other malicious path components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [YAML Bomb] Can an attacker craft a YAML file with deeply nested structures or recursive anchors/aliases (billion laughs attack) that causes exponential memory expansion during serde_yaml::from_reader() at line 25, leading to OOM crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Type Confusion] Does serde_yaml deserialization properly validate types, or can an attacker provide unexpected types (e.g., string instead of u64 for maximum_amount) that cause panic or undefined behavior during RunConfig construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Deserialization DoS] Can malformed YAML with deeply nested maps/sequences (thousands of levels) cause stack overflow during recursive parsing in serde_yaml::from_reader() at line 25? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Anchor Abuse] Can an attacker use YAML anchors and aliases to create circular references or extremely large expanded structures that bypass normal size limits during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Integer Overflow in Config] Does the YAML parser properly validate integer fields, or can an attacker specify values exceeding u64::MAX or negative values that wrap around when parsed into unsigned types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Sensitive Data Logging] Does the info! macro at line 32 log the entire RunConfig with Debug formatter, potentially exposing sensitive information like API keys (api_key field), private key paths (key_file_path), authentication tokens, or internal network topology? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Path Disclosure in Errors] Do the error messages at lines 19-22 and 26-29 expose full filesystem paths via to_string_lossy(), revealing internal server directory structure and potentially aiding in further attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Config Content Leakage] If an attacker can trigger validation with a malicious config, does the error output or logs reveal the parsed configuration content, potentially exposing other operators' configuration secrets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing ServerConfig Validation] Does the validation check if listen_address is a valid IP/hostname or can an attacker specify malformed addresses that cause bind failures or security issues later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing Port Range Check] Does validation ensure listen_port is in a valid range (1-65535) and not a privileged port (<1024) that might cause permission issues or conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing FunderConfig Validation] Does validation check that funder_config contains required assets, valid private keys exist at specified paths, and node_url is reachable before the faucet service starts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing Amount Limits Validation] Can an attacker configure maximum_amount or amount_to_fund with extreme values (0 or u64::MAX) that break faucet economics or cause integer overflow in transaction amount calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing Checker Config Validation] Does validation ensure checker_configs are well-formed, or can invalid checker configurations cause runtime panics when the faucet tries to build checkers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Missing Gas Parameters Validation] Does validation check gas_unit_price_override, max_gas_amount, and transaction_expiration_secs for reasonable values, or can extreme values cause transaction failures or economic attacks?
