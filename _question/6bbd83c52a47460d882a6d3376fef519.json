  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Minimum Stake Bypass] Is there validation for minimum stake amount? Can attackers create thousands of near-zero stake pools to bloat state or exhaust validator set capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Commission Front-Running] Can an attacker observe pending create_stake_pool transactions and front-run them with higher commission rates to steal potential delegators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [System Address Pool] Can operator or voter be set to system addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.) that might have special privileges, allowing stake pool operators to gain unauthorized system access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: ConstructionCommand::execute()] [Pattern Match Exhaustiveness] Does the match statement on lines 28-34 properly handle all enum variants? Could new command types be added without corresponding execution logic, causing panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: ConstructionCommand::execute()] [Error Propagation] Each inner.execute() call on lines 29-33 can fail - are errors properly propagated or could some failures be silently ignored, leading to false success reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: ConstructionCommand::execute()] [format_output Type Safety] The format_output call wraps each result - does this maintain error information or could critical error details be lost in formatting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Sequence Number Manipulation] When sequence_number is explicitly provided (line 49), can an attacker reuse the same sequence number across multiple commands (CreateAccount, Transfer, SetOperator, etc.) to cause transaction conflicts and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Nonce Reuse Attack] If sequence_number is None, does each command properly fetch the latest on-chain sequence number, or can race conditions cause multiple commands to use the same sequence, leading to transaction failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Sequence Number Gaps] Can an attacker intentionally create gaps in sequence numbers by submitting transactions with sequence_number = current + 10, blocking all intermediate transactions and causing account paralysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Sequence Number Race] In concurrent environments, can multiple CLI instances fetch the same sequence number, causing all but one transaction to fail and waste gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Gas Price Zero] Can an attacker set gas_price to 0 (line 59) across all commands to execute transactions without paying fees, undermining network economics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Gas Price Overflow] If gas_price is set to u64::MAX, does multiplication with max_gas overflow, causing incorrect fee calculations or transaction rejections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Max Gas Exhaustion] Can an attacker set max_gas to u64::MAX to reserve excessive computational resources, causing DoS by making transactions unprofitable for validators to include? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Gas Estimation Bypass] When max_gas and gas_price are None, the server estimates them - can an attacker manipulate on-chain state to cause estimation to return malicious values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Fee-Amount Confusion] In transfers, if gas fees exceed the transfer amount, does the transaction properly fail or can it result in negative balances or fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: sender (CreateAccountCommand)] [Key Rotation Confusion] When sender is provided (line 100) but doesn't match the private_key's derived address, which one is used for authorization? Can this be exploited to sign transactions on behalf of unauthorized accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: sender (TransferCommand)] [Authorization Bypass] The sender field is optional on line 150 - if omitted after key rotation, can this allow transfers from the wrong account or bypass authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: sender (SetOperatorCommand)] [Stake Pool Authority] When sender differs from the derived address, can this enable unauthorized stake pool operator changes by exploiting the sender override? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: sender (SetVoterCommand)] [Governance Authority] Can the optional sender field (line 263) be exploited to change voters on stake pools the attacker doesn't own by providing a spoofed sender address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: sender (CreateStakePoolCommand)] [Pool Ownership] When sender is specified (line 316), does this allow creating stake pools attributed to arbitrary accounts, causing ownership confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: network_args (all commands)] [Network Identifier Confusion] Can an attacker specify a malicious network identifier (e.g., testnet identifier on mainnet node) to bypass validation or cause cross-network replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: url_args (all commands)] [Malicious Server] Can an attacker provide a url_args pointing to a compromised Rosetta server that returns malicious metadata (gas prices, sequence numbers, addresses), causing unintended transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: url_args (all commands)] [Server Response Manipulation] Does the CLI validate server responses for reasonableness, or can a malicious server return extreme values (e.g., max_gas = 0) to cause transaction failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: url_args (all commands)] [HTTPS Enforcement] Is there validation that url_args uses HTTPS? Can an attacker perform MITM attacks on HTTP connections to steal private keys during transmission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: encoding_options (all commands)] [Encoding Confusion] Can an attacker specify mismatched encoding (e.g., claiming BCS but providing hex) to cause private key extraction failures that leak information or bypass validation? (Medium)"
