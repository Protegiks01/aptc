(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [State Corruption] Does the prologue_change_set parameter get validated before being passed to RespawnedSession::spawn(), or can an attacker inject malicious state changes through a corrupted prologue that bypasses validation and permanently corrupts blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [Context Injection] Can txn_meta.as_user_transaction_context() be manipulated to inject privileged context (like system signer capabilities) that allows unauthorized access to protected resources and system operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any limit on the size or complexity of prologue_change_set, or can an attacker provide an extremely large change set that causes memory exhaustion during RespawnedSession::spawn() leading to validator node crashes?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [Type Safety] Does RespawnedSession::spawn() validate that prologue_change_set contains only valid type-safe changes, or can type confusion in the change set lead to Move VM type system violations and potential arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [Reentrancy] Can the resolver parameter enable reentrant calls during session initialization that allow an attacker to manipulate state mid-initialization and create inconsistent session state leading to double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: new()] [Signature Bypass] Is the transaction signature already validated before new() is called, or can this function be invoked with an unsigned/invalid transaction that bypasses authentication and allows unauthorized operations?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: legacy_inherit_prologue_session()] [State Injection] Can a malicious prologue_session contain pre-committed malicious state changes that get inherited into the UserSession, allowing an attacker to inject unauthorized writes that bypass transaction validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: legacy_inherit_prologue_session()] [Version Confusion] Does this legacy path have different security guarantees than the new() path, and can an attacker force execution down this path to exploit weaker validation or missing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: legacy_inherit_prologue_session()] [Gas State Inheritance] Does the inherited prologue_session carry gas meter state, and can an attacker manipulate the prologue to reset or corrupt gas accounting causing under-charging or infinite execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: legacy_inherit_prologue_session()] [Context Elevation] Can the prologue_session contain elevated privileges or system context that gets inappropriately inherited into user code execution, allowing privilege escalation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: legacy_inherit_prologue_session()] [Change Set Validation] Is the change set within prologue_session validated before inheritance, or can corrupt/malicious changes bypass validation and cause determinism failures across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: finish()] [Change Set Squashing] In finish_with_squashed_change_set(), can overlapping writes between prologue and user execution lead to incorrect squashing where the wrong value wins, causing state inconsistency and potential fund loss? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/user.rs] [Function: finish()] [Storage Slot Assertion] The finish_with_squashed_change_set() call passes 'false' for assert_no_new_slots - does this allow transactions to create new storage slots without proper gas charging for storage expansion, enabling storage DoS attacks?
