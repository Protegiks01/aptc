  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_genesis_info()] [Allow New Validators Flag] Can the layout.allow_new_validators flag at line 289 be manipulated to permanently lock or unlock validator registration, enabling Sybil attacks or preventing decentralization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: get_validator_configs()] [Error Accumulation Attack] Does the error accumulation logic properly handle all error cases, or can certain critical errors be silently ignored if mixed with non-critical errors, allowing invalid validators into genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: get_validator_configs()] [Partial Validator Set] If some validators fail validation but others succeed, does the function properly reject the entire set, or can a partial validator set be used leading to insufficient consensus participants?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: get_config()] [Owner-Operator Mismatch Exploit] If the operator_account_address validation at line 496 can be bypassed through timing attacks or case-sensitivity issues, can an attacker use mismatched owner/operator pairs to gain unauthorized validator control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: get_config()] [Public Key Mismatch Attack] Can the operator_account_public_key comparison at line 506 be bypassed if keys are in different encodings (e.g., compressed vs uncompressed), allowing key substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: get_config()] [File Path Injection] Can the 'user' parameter be crafted with directory traversal sequences to read owner/operator files from unauthorized locations, leaking validator credentials? (High)",
