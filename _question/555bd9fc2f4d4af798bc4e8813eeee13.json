  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [API Surface Exposure] Does the public re-export of the entire ResolutionGraph type expose internal graph implementation details that could allow external callers to manipulate the dependency graph in unexpected ways, potentially causing dependency confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [Dependency Injection] Does the resolve() function re-exported from the resolver module properly validate all package cache and lock inputs, or can malicious callers provide compromised cache/lock implementations to inject malicious packages? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [Type Safety] Does the public exposure of the PackageLock type allow external code to manipulate lock state without going through proper validation in the lock module, potentially causing lock bypass vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [API Design] Does the separation of graph, lock, and resolver modules create opportunities for callers to use these components in inconsistent ways that violate security invariants? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [Visibility Control] Are all internal implementation details properly hidden via private modules, or do the public re-exports inadvertently expose internal functions that should not be accessible? (Low)"
