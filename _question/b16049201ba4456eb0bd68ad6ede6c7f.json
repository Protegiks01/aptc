  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: InnerBuilder::new()] [Proof cache poisoning] Is the provided ProofCache validated and cleared for the new epoch, or can stale proofs from the previous epoch be reused, bypassing proper signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Signer creation] Does ValidatorSigner::new() validate that author matches the public key derived from consensus_key, or can mismatched keys cause signature verification failures across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Ledger info panic] The expect() at line 242 will panic if get_latest_ledger_info() fails - can an attacker corrupt the database to trigger this panic and halt the validator during initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can last_committed_timestamp be manipulated if the ledger info is corrupted, causing batch expiry calculations to be incorrect and allowing expired batches to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Epoch boundary] Does is_new_epoch correctly detect epoch transitions, or can edge cases (like reconfiguration at the same timestamp) cause the batch store to incorrectly clear or retain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Batch request config] Are batch_request_num_peers, batch_request_retry_limit, and timeout values validated to prevent excessive retry storms that could amplify network traffic during attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Retry interval] Can batch_request_retry_interval_ms be 0, causing tight retry loops that exhaust CPU and network bandwidth when requesting missing batches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [RPC timeout] Can batch_request_rpc_timeout_ms be excessively large, causing the validator to hang indefinitely waiting for responses from Byzantine peers who never reply? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Quota validation] Are memory_quota, db_quota, and batch_quota validated to be non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can zero/MAX values cause the batch store to reject all batches or consume unlimited resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Quota ordering] Is memory_quota >= db_quota validated, or can inverted quotas cause the batch store to evict batches from memory while keeping them in the database, leading to unexpected fetch failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Hardcoded duration] The hardcoded Duration::from_secs(60) at line 265 - can this fixed batch expiry timeout be exploited to keep batches alive longer than intended by manipulating timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Batch store mutation] Does create_batch_store() correctly use &mut self to prevent concurrent calls, or can multiple threads call this simultaneously and create conflicting batch_store instances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: create_batch_store()] [Arc clone safety] Are batch_store and batch_reader Arc clones properly synchronized, or can one be updated while the other holds stale references? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [Unwrap safety] Line 286 uses coordinator_rx.take().unwrap() - can this unwrap panic if spawn_quorum_store() is called twice, and would such a panic halt the validator? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [Poll interval] Can batch_generation_poll_interval_ms be 0, causing the tokio interval to tick continuously and consume 100% CPU in the batch generator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [Task spawn ordering] Are the tasks spawned in the correct dependency order, or can race conditions occur if tasks start processing messages before their dependencies are ready? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [QuorumStoreCoordinator creation] Can the coordinator be created with inconsistent channel senders that route messages to wrong components, causing message routing failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [Channel sender clones] Are all the .clone() calls on command senders safe, or can message ordering guarantees be violated when multiple senders write to the same channel? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [BatchGenerator initialization] Can BatchGenerator::new() fail if storage or batch_store is in an inconsistent state, and would this cause the spawned task to panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_builder.rs] [Function: spawn_quorum_store()] [Network sender sharing] Is it safe to pass the same network_sender clone to multiple components, or can concurrent sends cause message corruption or race conditions? (High)",
