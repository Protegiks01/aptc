  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Panic safety] The function uses unwrap() on pop_back() which can panic - if this panic occurs during transaction execution, can it leave the VM in an inconsistent state or cause transaction replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Error propagation] The function returns PartialVMResult which can contain errors - are all error paths properly handled by the caller, or can error swallowing lead to silent failures where events are not written but transactions succeed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Gas charging on error] If the function encounters an error after computing the gas cost, is gas still charged, or can attackers trigger repeated errors to consume validator resources without paying gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Unhandled edge cases] What happens if msg.legacy_abstract_memory_size() returns an error or exceptional value - is this properly handled or can it cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Context manipulation] The _context parameter is unused - can a malicious native function or VM modification abuse this context to access or modify global state without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Type argument mismatch] The function expects exactly one type argument but doesn't validate its kind (struct, primitive, reference) - can providing unsupported type kinds cause crashes or bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Bytecode verification bypass] Can malicious bytecode bypass Move's type safety checks and invoke this native function with invalid arguments that were never validated by the verifier? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [VM state corruption] If this native function is called during VM initialization, cleanup, or error handling, can it corrupt the VM state machine and allow arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Module registration] The make_all() function registers the native under name 'write_to_event_store' - can module name collisions or namespace pollution allow malicious modules to override this native with a compromised implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: WriteToEventStoreGasParameters] [Parameter initialization] Is there validation ensuring unit_cost is within reasonable bounds during GasParameters initialization, or can extremely high values cause legitimate users to be priced out of event emission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: GasParameters] [Struct padding] Can attackers exploit struct padding or alignment issues in GasParameters to cause inconsistent memory layouts across platforms, leading to non-deterministic gas parameter reads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Gas frontrunning] Can attackers observe pending gas parameter updates and front-run them to emit large numbers of events at old (lower) gas prices before the update takes effect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: WriteToEventStoreGasParameters] [Clone implementation] The struct derives Clone - can cloning gas parameters during concurrent updates lead to torn reads where unit_cost is partially updated, causing inconsistent gas charges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: GasParameters] [Debug information leak] The structs derive Debug - can debug output leak sensitive gas parameter information that aids attackers in optimizing their exploitation strategies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Serialization bypass] Does the function verify that the event message is properly serializable before charging gas, or can attackers craft unserializable events that consume gas but fail to write, causing gas charge without storage effect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Storage commitment] After returning NativeResult::ok(), is there a guarantee the event will be persisted to storage, or can transaction rollbacks or storage failures cause events to be charged but never stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Event ordering] Does the function guarantee sequential consistency for events emitted by the same transaction, or can race conditions or parallel execution cause events to be stored out of order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Storage amplification] Can the actual storage size of an event significantly exceed legacy_abstract_memory_size() due to serialization overhead, indexes, or metadata, causing systematic storage exhaustion despite adequate gas charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Reference type handling] Can attackers pass reference types (&T or &mut T) instead of owned values in ty_args or arguments, causing memory unsafety when the event is serialized or stored? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Ability constraints] Does the function verify that the event type T has the required abilities (copy, store, drop), or can types without proper abilities be written causing resource leaks or duplication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Generic type instantiation] Can malicious code provide malformed or recursive generic type parameters that cause infinite loops or stack overflows during type instantiation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Resource duplication] If the event message contains Move resources, can this function inadvertently duplicate resources by copying them to the event store, violating Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Phantom type exploitation] Can attackers use phantom type parameters to bypass type checking and write events with incorrect type information, causing confusion in event indexers and analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Event authenticity] Does the function validate the integrity of the event message or can modified/tampered event data be written if the VM's memory is compromised? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Access control bypass] Can unauthorized modules or accounts call this native function directly to emit events on behalf of other accounts, enabling event log pollution or spoofing attacks? (High)"
