  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: GithubRepo::from_str()] [Insufficient Validation] Does the repository parsing only check for exactly two parts, or can attackers provide 'owner/repo/extra' to bypass validation and exploit downstream consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: GithubRepo::from_str()] [Empty String Attack] Can an attacker provide empty strings for owner or repository (e.g., '/repository' or 'owner/'), passing validation but causing panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: SetupGit::execute()] [Layout File Validation] Does Layout::from_disk() validate the structure and contents of the layout file, or can malicious YAML cause genesis corruption? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: GitOptions] [Path Validation] Are PathBuf parameters (layout_file, github_token_file, local_repository_dir) validated to prevent directory traversal or access to restricted paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: GithubRepo parsing] [Case Sensitivity] Can case variations in repository names cause inconsistent behavior or bypass security checks in repository access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client::get()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely large files that consume all available memory when read_to_string() loads the entire file contents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client::get_framework()] [Framework Size Attack] Is there a size limit on the ReleaseBundle, or can attackers provide multi-GB framework files that exhaust disk space or memory during genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: from_yaml()] [YAML Bomb] Can malicious YAML with deeply nested structures or billions of nodes cause exponential memory consumption during deserialization? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: base64::decode()] [Decompression Bomb] If the base64 encoded data expands significantly on decoding, can this cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
