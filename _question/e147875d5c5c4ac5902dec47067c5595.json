  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Struct: Config] [Input Validation] Can an attacker set sender_spread_factor, platform_use_case_spread_factor, or user_use_case_spread_factor to zero or extremely large values through on-chain configuration, causing transaction ordering manipulation or integer overflow in delay calculations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Struct: Config] [Fairness Violation] Can a malicious validator or governance proposal set asymmetric spread factors (e.g., platform_use_case_spread_factor=1, user_use_case_spread_factor=1000) to create unfair transaction ordering that favors platform transactions over user transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: use_case_spread_factor()] [Logic Error] Does the use_case_spread_factor() function properly handle all UseCaseKey variants, or can a new enum variant cause panic or default to incorrect spread factor values? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: use_case_spread_factor()] [Discriminatory Ordering] Can the hardcoded logic that treats Platform use cases differently from ContractAddress and Others be exploited by attackers who craft transactions to be classified as Platform to receive preferential ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Struct: UseCaseAwareShuffler] [State Management] Is the Config stored in UseCaseAwareShuffler immutable, or can it be modified during shuffling, leading to inconsistent transaction ordering across different blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: shuffle()] [Determinism] Does shuffle() produce deterministic results given the same input transactions and config, or can non-determinism cause different validators to produce different block orderings, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: shuffle()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit a large number of transactions that cause shuffle() to consume excessive memory or CPU, potentially causing validator nodes to crash or miss consensus deadlines? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: shuffle()] [Transaction Loss] Can the shuffle() function drop transactions silently if the iterator encounters errors, leading to valid transactions being excluded from blocks without proper error reporting? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: signed_transaction_iterator()] [Iterator Safety] Does signed_transaction_iterator() return a boxed iterator with 'static lifetime - can this cause use-after-free if the Config is modified while the iterator is still in use? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: signed_transaction_iterator()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the fact that signed_transaction_iterator() and signature_verified_transaction_iterator() use different transaction types to cause type confusion or bypass signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Function: signature_verified_transaction_iterator()] [Verification Bypass] Can an attacker submit SignatureVerifiedTransaction::Invalid transactions that get shuffled but should have been filtered earlier, potentially including invalid transactions in blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Struct: ShuffledTransactionIterator] [State Consistency] Can the input_idx and output_idx counters overflow with a large number of transactions, causing incorrect delay calculations or panic conditions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does new() properly initialize all queue structures, or can uninitialized state lead to undefined behavior during transaction shuffling? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Queue Overflow] Can extended_with() accept an unbounded number of transactions into input_queue, leading to memory exhaustion and validator crash? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Ordering Violation] If extended_with() is called multiple times, does it maintain the original input ordering, or can it cause transactions to be reordered in unexpected ways? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn()] [Counter Manipulation] Does select_next_txn() properly increment output_idx only when a transaction is returned, or can failed selections cause output_idx to desynchronize with actual output? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Logic Error] Can select_next_txn_inner() return None prematurely when transactions exist but are all delayed, causing valid transactions to be dropped from blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Priority Inversion] In step 1 (pop delayed queue), can an attacker craft transactions that continuously reset delays, causing high-priority transactions to be perpetually delayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Queue Starvation] In step 2 (input queue processing), can transactions from certain senders or use cases be starved indefinitely if they're always delayed while others proceed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Infinite Loop] Can the while loop in step 2 run indefinitely if queue_or_return() consistently returns None, causing validator timeout and consensus failure? (High)",
