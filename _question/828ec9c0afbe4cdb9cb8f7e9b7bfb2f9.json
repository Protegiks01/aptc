  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Deserialization attack] Can a malicious peer send a crafted BCS-serialized request with invalid enum discriminants that bypass serde validation, causing deserialization panics that crash validator nodes and halt consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Hash flooding] If LatencyPingRequest instances are stored in HashMaps based on their Hash implementation, can an attacker send millions of requests with colliding hashes to degrade HashMap performance to O(n) causing validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Derive: Hash, Eq] [Hash-Eq inconsistency] Does the derived Hash implementation guarantee that equal LatencyPingRequest instances (by Eq) produce identical hashes, or can hash inconsistencies cause silent data corruption in HashMap/HashSet storage?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Field: ping_counter] [Replay attack] Can an attacker capture legitimate LatencyPingRequest packets with specific ping_counter values and replay them to fake low latency measurements, causing the victim to prefer malicious peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Counter prediction] Is ping_counter incremented predictably (e.g., sequentially), allowing attackers to forge valid-looking LatencyPingRequest messages by predicting future counter values? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Counter wrapping] When ping_counter wraps around from u64::MAX to 0, can this cause incorrect latency calculations or allow replayed old requests with counter value 0 to be accepted as fresh? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Variant flooding] Can an attacker selectively flood the network with expensive request types (e.g., GetNetworkInformation requiring peer metadata collection) while avoiding cheap ones (GetServerProtocolVersion) to cause resource exhaustion?
