  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Buffer allocation] On line 36, vec![0u8; byte_size] allocates a buffer every iteration - can an attacker provide a G with extremely large compressed_size() causing excessive memory allocation and OOM crashes during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Serialization vulnerability] The unwrap() on serialize_compressed() (line 37) assumes serialization always succeeds, but can malformed gamma values cause serialization failures that panic the validator during DKG decryption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Memory exhaustion] If n is very large (close to u32::MAX), the loop (lines 35-44) could run for billions of iterations with memory allocations each time, causing validator nodes to run out of memory and crash during DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Buffer reuse attack] Since buf is reallocated every loop iteration, can an attacker exploit timing differences in allocation patterns to perform side-channel attacks revealing information about the discrete log being computed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Serialization buffer overflow] Does serialize_compressed guarantee it writes exactly byte_size bytes, or could it write more/less causing buffer corruption and undefined behavior when buf is used as HashMap key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Panic condition] The expect() on line 28 will panic if baby_table.len() > u32::MAX, causing the entire validator node to crash during DKG - is there input validation elsewhere preventing this scenario? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Unwrap panic] The unwrap() on line 37 will panic if serialization fails, but are there edge cases with certain curve configurations or point values that could trigger serialization failures and crash validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Silent failure] When dlog() returns None (line 46), the caller in transcript.rs uses expect() and panics (line 527), but is this the correct behavior or should DKG gracefully handle cases where discrete log cannot be found? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Error propagation] Should dlog() return Result<Option<u32>, Error> instead of Option<u32> to provide better error information about why discrete log computation failed, allowing more intelligent DKG failure handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Early failure] On line 62, if any single discrete log fails, the entire function returns None and all previous computations are discarded - can an attacker inject one bad value in H_vec to cause complete DKG failure for all validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Partial success handling] When dlog_vec() returns None due to one element failing, does the caller have enough information to determine which element failed, or could this obscure Byzantine behavior during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Timing side-channel] The loop (lines 35-44) terminates early when a match is found in baby_table (line 39-40), causing execution time to vary based on the discrete log value - can this timing leak be exploited to learn information about secret key shares during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Cache timing attack] HashMap lookups (line 39) may have timing variations based on hash collisions and table structure - can an attacker analyze these timing patterns during DKG to infer information about the baby_table structure or discrete log values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Early termination leak] Since the function returns immediately when a match is found (line 40), the number of loop iterations directly reveals information about the discrete log value - is this timing information exploitable in the DKG context? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Memory access pattern] The sequence of gamma values computed (line 43) creates a predictable memory access pattern - can attackers use CPU cache side-channels to observe these patterns and extract secret information during DKG? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Batch timing attack] Processing multiple discrete logs in sequence (lines 58-64) with early failure creates timing correlations - can attackers distinguish Byzantine transcripts from honest ones by measuring total execution time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Share recovery attack] Since dlog() is used to decrypt secret key shares from ElGamal ciphertexts during DKG, can an attacker who controls the baby_table manipulate discrete log results to bias or predict the final validator consensus keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Cross-validator consistency] If different validators receive slightly different baby_tables (e.g., due to network corruption), will dlog() produce different discrete logs causing DKG to fail with inconsistent shares across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Malicious dealer attack] Can a Byzantine dealer craft ElGamal ciphertexts with H values specifically chosen to cause dlog() to return None, allowing them to selectively exclude honest validators from DKG participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Chunk manipulation] Since discrete logs are computed for individual chunks in chunked ElGamal, can an attacker manipulate chunk values such that individual dlog() calls succeed but the reassembled scalar is invalid or weak? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Batch atomicity] Does the all-or-nothing behavior of dlog_vec() (lines 58-64) create vulnerabilities where one corrupted chunk causes entire DKG decryption to fail, enabling denial-of-service against specific validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Range limit bypass] If range_limit doesn't match pp.ell correctly (expected 1 << ell as seen in line 525 of transcript.rs), can attackers exploit mismatched parameters to cause discrete log failures or incorrect recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Generator mismatch] If the G passed to dlog() doesn't match pp.pp_elgamal.G used elsewhere in DKG, will this cause silent failures where all discrete logs are incorrect but computation succeeds, corrupting the entire DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Validator set attack] If dlog() failures during DKG prevent a validator from recovering their key share, can Byzantine actors exploit this to exclude specific honest validators from the validator set, gaining disproportionate consensus power? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [DKG liveness failure] If multiple validators experience dlog() failures simultaneously (e.g., due to incorrect baby_table distribution), can this cause total DKG failure preventing epoch transitions and halting the blockchain? (Critical)"
