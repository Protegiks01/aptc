  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Module Name Injection] Can the module_name parameter at line 98 contain path traversal sequences (../, ..\\), absolute paths, or special characters that bypass get_module_by_name_from_root() validation and access modules outside the package root, potentially exposing internal framework code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Source Path Traversal] At line 121, does source_path from the compilation unit get validated before being passed to compute_source_coverage(), or can it point to arbitrary files outside the package directory through symlinks or relative paths, causing sensitive source code to be displayed with coverage annotations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Panic on Type Mismatch] At line 124, the code panics with 'Should all be modules' if a non-Module unit is encountered - can an attacker craft a package structure that triggers this panic during coverage analysis, causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Unreachable Code Path] At line 132, 'unreachable!' assumes all root modules are CompiledUnit::Module - could compiler bugs, race conditions, or package corruption cause this assumption to be violated, triggering an abort that crashes the coverage tool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [ANSI Escape Injection] When color is set to ColorChoice::Always or Auto at line 102, does output_source_coverage() at line 137-138 properly validate that ANSI color codes cannot be injected through source code content, module names, or coverage data to execute terminal commands or obfuscate malicious code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Source File Disclosure] If compute_source_coverage() at line 136 fails to validate that source_path is within the package boundary, can an attacker trick the tool into displaying coverage for system files, framework internals, or other packages' source code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Coverage Map Poisoning] Can multiple test runs with different coverage patterns cause SourceCoverageBuilder at line 135 to produce incorrect or inconsistent source coverage displays that mislead developers about actual code coverage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [TextIndicator Bypass] Does the tag parameter (TextIndicator::Explicit) at line 106 properly validate input, or can custom indicators inject malicious content into the coverage output that executes when rendered in terminal emulators with vulnerable escape sequence handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Large File DoS] Can an attacker provide a Move module with an extremely large source file that causes compute_source_coverage() to allocate excessive memory or take unreasonable time processing line-by-line coverage annotations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Error Handling Race] At line 139-140, if output_source_coverage() fails and returns an error, could the error formatting itself trigger additional failures or expose sensitive debug information through the CliError::UnexpectedError wrapper? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Module Name Validation] Can the module_name parameter at line 148 be exploited to access bytecode for framework modules (0x1::*), standard library modules, or other packages outside the intended scope through inadequate validation in get_module_by_name_from_root()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Disassembler Injection] When creating Disassembler::from_unit() at line 162, can malformed CompiledUnit data cause the disassembler to generate invalid output, inject assembly-like code that appears legitimate, or crash with unsafe memory access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Coverage Map Mismatch] At line 163, if the coverage_map contains execution counts for different bytecode than what's in the compiled unit (e.g., from a stale .coverage_map.mvcov), can this cause incorrect coverage annotations, crashes, or disclosure of coverage data for the wrong module? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Disassembly Output Injection] At line 164, does the disassembler's output properly escape or sanitize bytecode operands, function names, and type parameters before printing, or can malicious module metadata inject terminal escape sequences, format strings, or command injection payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Large Bytecode DoS] Can an attacker craft a Move module with extremely large function bodies, constant pools, or type parameter lists that cause disassemble() to exhaust memory or take excessive time generating the disassembly output?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Unified Exec Map Race] If to_unified_exec_map() is called concurrently by multiple coverage commands, can race conditions in the coverage map transformation cause incorrect execution counts or data corruption in the unified map? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: CoveragePackage::execute()] [Variant Confusion] Can the enum dispatch at lines 223-227 be exploited if an attacker somehow corrupts the enum discriminant through memory unsafety in dependencies, causing the wrong coverage command to execute with mismatched parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: CoveragePackage::execute()] [Serialization Bypass] Does execute_serialized_success() properly serialize errors and results, or can attackers craft inputs that cause serialization failures to be silently ignored, hiding coverage generation errors from users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: CoveragePackage::execute()] [Async Safety] Since the execute() method is async, are there any race conditions or concurrency issues when multiple coverage commands run simultaneously on the same package, potentially corrupting shared state or file system resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Compiler Version Downgrade] Can an attacker force the coverage tool to use an older, vulnerable Move compiler version through move_options configuration, then exploit known compiler bugs to generate malicious bytecode that appears to have legitimate coverage data?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Symlink Attack] Can attackers use symbolic links in the package directory structure to cause the coverage tool to read or write files in unintended locations, potentially overwriting important files or exfiltrating data through coverage reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Test Code Execution] Since coverage is generated from test runs, can malicious test code exploit the coverage tool's file I/O operations (reading source, writing reports) to escape the test sandbox and perform unauthorized operations on the host system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Coverage Data Tampering] Can an attacker pre-generate a malicious .coverage_map.mvcov file with fabricated execution counts that make malicious code appear well-tested, deceiving code reviewers and security auditors about the actual test coverage?
