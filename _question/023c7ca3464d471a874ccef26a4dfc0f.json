  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Information Disclosure] Does the version string loaded from include_str! at compile time expose sensitive internal version information that could help attackers identify vulnerable faucet deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Constant: VERSION] [Path Traversal] Can the include_str! macro for VERSION reading '../../../doc/.version' be exploited if an attacker can control the build environment to inject malicious version strings or cause build-time code execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Constant: VERSION] [Input Validation] Is the version string from the .version file properly validated and sanitized before being used in the OpenAPI service, or could malformed version data cause crashes or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing the exact version number in the OpenAPI specification allow attackers to quickly identify known vulnerabilities in specific faucet versions without probing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Type Confusion] Can the tuple composition (basic_api, captcha_api, fund_api) be exploited if the order of APIs changes, causing endpoints to be mapped incorrectly or validation to be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Authentication Bypass] Does the service builder ensure that authentication and rate limiting from BasicApi is applied before FundApi endpoints are accessible, or can attackers directly access funding endpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Access Control] Is there validation that the three API components (BasicApi, CaptchaApi, FundApi) don't contain conflicting endpoint paths that could cause routing ambiguity and allow unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [State Isolation] Are the three API components properly isolated, or can state corruption in one component (e.g., BasicApi's semaphore) affect the security of other components like FundApi? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Parameter: apis] [Initialization Order] Does the order of API initialization in the tuple matter for security, and could reordering cause critical checkers or rate limiters to be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Path Traversal] Can the hardcoded server path '/v1' be exploited through path traversal attacks if the OpenAPI framework doesn't properly normalize paths, allowing access to internal endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: server()] [Route Hijacking] Does setting the server path to '/v1' without validation allow attackers to craft requests that bypass this prefix and access unprotected legacy endpoints like /mint directly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: server()] [API Versioning] Is the '/v1' server path enforced consistently across all endpoints, or can attackers access the same endpoints without the /v1 prefix to bypass newer security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: server()] [Configuration Override] Can the server path be overridden at runtime through environment variables or configuration, potentially allowing attackers with partial access to remap critical endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: description()] [Information Disclosure] Does the placeholder description 'todo' expose that the service is in development or incomplete, encouraging attackers to probe for unfinished security controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: license()] [Legal/Security] Does exposing Apache 2.0 license information in the API service provide attackers with information about the codebase structure or deployment model? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: contact()] [Social Engineering] Can the contact information ('Aptos Labs', GitHub URL) be used by attackers for social engineering attacks against the faucet operators or to identify the team? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the OpenApiService::new() call properly initialize resource limits, or can attackers exploit the service construction to exhaust memory by requesting large OpenAPI schemas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Panic Safety] If any of the builder methods (.server, .description, .license, .contact) panic during construction, does this leave the service in an undefined state that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Type Safety] Are the type parameters of OpenApiService<(BasicApi, CaptchaApi, FundApi), ()> properly constrained to prevent type confusion attacks in the Rust type system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing CORS] Does the service builder configure CORS policies, or are all origins allowed by default, enabling cross-site attacks against faucet users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Rate Limiting] Is global rate limiting configured at the service level, or does the service rely solely on individual API component rate limits that could be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing TLS] Does the service configuration enforce TLS/HTTPS, or can the faucet be deployed over unencrypted HTTP allowing request interception and fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Authentication] Is authentication configured at the service level, or can anyone access the OpenAPI service without authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Request Size Limits] Does the service enforce maximum request body sizes, or can attackers send arbitrarily large requests to cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Timeout] Are request timeouts configured at the service level to prevent slowloris attacks, or can attackers hold connections open indefinitely? (Medium)"
