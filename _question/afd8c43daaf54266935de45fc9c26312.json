  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkStatusCommand::execute()] [SSRF attack] Similar to NetworkOptionsCommand, can the NetworkRequest parameter enable SSRF attacks through URL construction in the underlying client.network_status() call? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkListCommand/NetworkOptionsCommand/NetworkStatusCommand via UrlArgs] [URL validation] Does UrlArgs properly validate the rosetta_api_url before creating the client, or can file://, gopher://, or other dangerous URL schemes be used to attack local services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via UrlArgs] [DNS rebinding] Can DNS rebinding attacks cause the RosettaClient to connect to attacker-controlled servers after initial validation, allowing network command responses to be manipulated mid-session? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via UrlArgs] [Port scanning] Can the rosetta_api_url be used to scan internal network ports by observing connection timeout differences, leaking information about internal service availability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via UrlArgs] [Credential leakage] If rosetta_api_url contains embedded credentials (http://user:pass@host), are these properly sanitized in logs and error messages to prevent credential leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkOptionsCommand/NetworkStatusCommand via NetworkArgs] [Chain ID injection] Does network_args.network_request() properly serialize the chain_id, or can special characters or malformed chain IDs cause JSON injection in the NetworkRequest? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkOptionsCommand/NetworkStatusCommand via NetworkArgs] [Default chain ID attack] Is the default ChainId::test() appropriate for production CLI usage, or can users accidentally operate on testnet when they intend mainnet operations, causing fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkOptionsCommand/NetworkStatusCommand via NetworkArgs] [Chain ID overflow] Can extremely large chain_id values cause integer overflow or parsing errors in the NetworkIdentifier construction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [Command confusion] Can responses from network_list() influence the behavior of network_options() or network_status() in unexpected ways if multiple commands are chained together? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [State persistence] Are there any hidden state dependencies between commands that could cause security issues if commands are executed in specific sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [Client connection reuse] If the RosettaClient connection is reused across multiple command invocations, can stale connection state cause security issues like using cached responses or wrong network identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All execute() methods] [Async timeout] Do the async execute() methods implement proper timeout handling, or can slow server responses cause the CLI to hang indefinitely, enabling denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All execute() methods] [Panic handling] Are panics in async code properly caught and converted to Results, or can server responses with unexpected formats cause unwrap() panics that crash the CLI? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All execute() methods] [Cancellation safety] If async operations are cancelled (Ctrl+C), are resources properly cleaned up, or can partial state corruption occur in the RosettaClient? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via client calls] [Deserialization bombs] Can malicious servers send deeply nested JSON structures in NetworkListResponse, NetworkOptionsResponse, or NetworkStatusResponse that cause stack overflow during serde deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via client calls] [Type confusion] Can responses with incorrect types (e.g., string instead of u64 for block_height) cause deserialization to succeed with default values, leading to incorrect network status interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands via client calls] [Unicode handling] Do NetworkIdentifier blockchain and network fields properly handle unicode, or can specially crafted unicode characters cause parsing errors or display issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [Server impersonation] Does the CLI verify it's communicating with an authentic Aptos Rosetta server, or can attackers impersonate servers to manipulate all network command responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [API version mismatch] Can CLI commands succeed against incompatible Rosetta API server versions, potentially causing transaction construction errors in other CLI commands due to mismatched operation types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: All Commands] [Error response handling] Are Rosetta API error responses properly distinguished from success responses, or can crafted error payloads be misinterpreted as valid network information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkListCommand::execute()] [Empty network list] Can network_list() return an empty network_identifiers array, and does this cause proper error handling or silent failure in dependent commands? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkOptionsCommand::execute()] [Missing required fields] Can NetworkOptionsResponse omit required fields like version or allow, causing downstream parsing errors or incorrect operation validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkStatusCommand::execute()] [Block identifier inconsistency] Can current_block_identifier.index and current_block_identifier.hash be inconsistent (pointing to different blocks), causing state confusion in transaction submission? (High)"
