  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Version boundary testing] Are there comprehensive tests validating behavior at each version boundary (e.g., V21 vs V22 for enum gas)? Can untested version transitions hide critical gas calculation bugs that only manifest at specific version boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Fuzzing coverage] Are gas_feature_version values fuzzed in transaction execution tests? Could fuzzing with invalid version numbers (e.g., 0, u64::MAX, gaps) reveal unchecked assumptions causing panics or incorrect behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Regression testing] The changelog shows many version-gated bug fixes (V21 type conversion fix, V34 function compatibility) - are there regression tests ensuring these bugs cannot be re-exploited through version manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Comment: Lines 5-74] [Changelog accuracy] The changelog documents gas changes per version, but can discrepancies between documented and actual feature gate checks lead developers to incorrectly assume features are/aren't available at certain versions, introducing security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Comment: Lines 5-9] [Version bump policy] The comment states 'should be bumped exactly once after each release' - is this enforced programmatically? Can multiple version bumps in a single release or forgotten bumps cause version numbering to desynchronize from actual releases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Constant naming] The RELEASE_V1_XX naming suggests mainnet releases, but version values are used for feature gating - can confusion between release versions and feature versions cause developers to use wrong version checks in gas-critical code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Zero version edge case] What happens if gas_feature_version is 0 (default for uninitialized state)? Are there proper fallbacks, or would this cause all feature-gated code to take unexpected branches, potentially enabling ancient exploits or bypassing all modern protections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Version comparison overflow] If code uses subtraction for version comparisons (e.g., current_version - required_version), can underflow when current_version < required_version cause logic errors that bypass version checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Multi-version attack] Can an attacker submit a batch of transactions each crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in different gas versions, forcing validators to constantly switch version contexts and causing performance degradation or incorrect caching behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Transaction intrinsic gas] The check_gas function uses gas_feature_version to determine MAXIMUM_APPROVED_TRANSACTION_SIZE (legacy vs V18+) - can version manipulation bypass size limits to submit oversized transactions that cause memory exhaustion or processing delays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Randomness gas exploit] V12+ changed randomness gas calculation - can attackers exploit the older randomness implementation at V11 to generate random values at incorrect costs, enabling biased randomness or computational DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Algebra gas parameter updates] The Python scripts (update_bls12381_algebra_gas_params.py, update_bn254_algebra_gas_params.py) reference LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION - can stale gas parameters for expensive algebraic operations combined with version checks allow underpriced cryptographic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Table operations pricing] V2 fixed 'gas formula for loading resources so that they are consistent with other global operations' - can reverting to V1 behavior through version manipulation exploit inconsistent resource/table pricing for arbitrage or economic attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [ChangeSetConfigs version gating] V5 made ChangeSetConfigs configurable - can version manipulation force use of non-configurable ChangeSetConfigs, bypassing limits on write operations or event emissions imposed by governance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [STORAGE_WRITE_LIMIT_REACHED bypass] V3 introduced aborting with STORAGE_WRITE_LIMIT_REACHED - can executing with gas_feature_version 2 bypass these limits to perform unlimited writes in a single transaction, causing state bloat? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [New vs existing resource pricing] V3 distinguished between new and existing resources for storage charges - can version manipulation exploit uniform pricing to perform storage operations at incorrect rates, breaking storage economic model? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Compilation determinism] Is LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION guaranteed to be identical across all validators in an epoch? Can different compiler optimizations or build environments cause macro expansion differences that lead to version mismatches and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Enum variant consistency] Are the u64 values for version constants (11, 13, 15, 22, etc.) cryptographically committed anywhere on-chain, or can validators with modified binaries claim arbitrary version values to manipulate feature availability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Emergency upgrade] In emergency scenarios requiring immediate gas schedule changes, can LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION be updated via fast-track governance, or would validators need recompilation and coordinated restart, creating downtime windows? (High)"
