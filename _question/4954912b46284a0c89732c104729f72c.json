  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pending_votes.rs] [Function: insert_round_timeout()] [BLS signature aggregation security] At line 239, BLS signatures are aggregated - can signature aggregation be exploited via rogue key attacks where a malicious validator crafts their key to cancel out other signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pending_votes.rs] [Function: insert_vote()] [Signature with status] At line 369, vote.signature_with_status() is used - what is the 'status' component, and can it be manipulated to affect signature verification or voting power calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pending_votes.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutVotes::partial_2chain_tc_mut()] [Mutable reference safety] At lines 90-92, a mutable reference to partial_2chain_tc is returned - can external code mutate this in ways that violate invariants maintained by PendingVotes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pending_votes.rs] [Function: TwoChainTimeoutVotes::unpack_aggregate()] [Ownership transfer] At lines 156-162, self is consumed and partial_2chain_tc is returned - can this cause issues if calling code expects to retain access to timeout_reason HashMap? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pending_votes.rs] [Struct: TwoChainTimeoutVotes] [Partial TC initialization] At line 74, TwoChainTimeoutWithPartialSignatures::new() is called with timeout.clone() - does this properly initialize all required fields, or can uninitialized data cause verification failures?
