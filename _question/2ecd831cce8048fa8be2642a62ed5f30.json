  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Replay Attack] Can the same CollectionUriMutateEvent be emitted multiple times for the same collection without proper sequence numbers or timestamps, allowing attackers to replay historical URI mutations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Ordering] If multiple URI mutation events are emitted in the same transaction, is there guaranteed ordering, or can race conditions cause events to be processed out-of-order leading to incorrect final URI state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Cross-Transaction Consistency] Can an attacker emit URI mutation events across multiple transactions that, when processed atomically, create inconsistent state (e.g., old_uri in event N+1 doesn't match new_uri in event N)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Flood Attack] Can an attacker emit unbounded numbers of CollectionUriMutateEvents for a single collection, causing state bloat in event stores and indexer databases even if individual events are valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Indexer Desync] If an indexer fails to process a CollectionUriMutateEvent due to malformed data, can this cause permanent desynchronization where the indexer's view of collection URIs diverges from on-chain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [BCS Encoding Determinism] Does the BCS serialization of CollectionUriMutateEvent produce deterministic output for the same input data, or can non-determinism cause different validators to produce different event hashes? (Critical)",
