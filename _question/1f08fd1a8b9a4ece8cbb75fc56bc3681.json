  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: save_delta()] [Version Tagging] Does save_delta include version information in the saved file to detect incompatibilities during load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: load_delta()] [Schema Evolution] How does load_delta handle schema changes in StateKey or StateValue structures - can old deltas cause crashes with new code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: load_delta()] [Forward Compatibility] Can deltas saved by newer versions be safely loaded by older versions, or will it cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: save_delta()] [Deterministic Output] Does the combination of BTreeMap and serde_json pretty-printing guarantee deterministic output across platforms for verification purposes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: load_delta()] [Duplicate Keys] How does serde_json::from_str handle duplicate keys in the JSON input - can attackers exploit this to override state entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: save_delta()] [Nested Resources] Can deeply nested Move resources in StateValues cause stack overflow during BCS serialization or JSON formatting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: load_delta()] [Cyclic References] If StateValues contain references to other state (e.g., table handles), can cyclic dependencies cause infinite loops during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: save_delta()] [Character Escaping] Does JSON serialization properly escape special characters in StateKey strings, or can injection attacks occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/delta.rs] [Function: load_delta()] [Malformed JSON] Can strategically crafted malformed JSON cause the parser to hang or enter infinite loops, denying service? (Medium)",
