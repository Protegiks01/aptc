  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) race condition where an attacker can modify the config file between validation and actual use, flipping security flags from false to true? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Serialization round-trip] If NodeStartupConfig is serialized to disk and then deserialized, could bit flips or encoding issues cause false to become true for security flags, disabling security checks on node restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Format confusion] Can an attacker exploit differences between YAML and JSON serialization formats to inject skip_config_sanitizer=true in one format that gets interpreted differently in another format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Shallow copy attack] When NodeStartupConfig is cloned using the Copy trait, could there be scenarios where the cloned config has security flags modified independently of the original, causing inconsistent security states across the codebase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Memory corruption] Could memory corruption or use-after-free bugs cause copied NodeStartupConfig instances to have corrupted security flag values (e.g., garbage values interpreted as true)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information disclosure] Does the Debug implementation log the values of skip_config_optimizer and skip_config_sanitizer to disk or network, potentially revealing to attackers which nodes have security checks disabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Log injection] Can an attacker craft NodeStartupConfig values that, when logged via Debug, inject malicious log entries or escape sequences that could be exploited by log analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Derive: PartialEq, Eq] [Timing attack] Could the PartialEq implementation for NodeStartupConfig be vulnerable to timing attacks that reveal whether security flags are enabled based on comparison execution time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Test: test_node_startup_config_default] [Insufficient test coverage] Does the single test only verify default values are false, without testing deserialization edge cases, malicious input handling, or the security implications of setting flags to true?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Execution config bypass] Can setting skip_config_optimizer=true prevent critical ExecutionConfig optimizations, causing validators to run with suboptimal gas settings or disabled parallel execution, leading to consensus timing issues?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Network split] If a significant portion of validators set skip_config_optimizer=true and misconfigure their network settings, could this create network partitions where different validator subsets cannot communicate, breaking consensus and causing a chain halt?
