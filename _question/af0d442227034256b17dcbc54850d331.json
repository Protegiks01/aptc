  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: write_message_in_place()] [Message Gap] If a write fails but the nonce is incremented, does this create a permanent gap in the nonce sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Struct: NoiseSession] [Bidirectional] Are write_nonce and read_nonce properly independent, preventing cross-direction nonce confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Struct: NoiseSession] [Key Cleanup] Are write_key and read_key zeroized when NoiseSession is dropped, preventing key recovery from memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Struct: InitiatorHandshakeState] [Ephemeral Cleanup] Is the ephemeral private key (e) zeroized after use, preventing recovery if handshake state is leaked? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: hkdf()] [Intermediate Keys] Are intermediate key materials (k, k1, k2) zeroized after use, or could they leak from stack/heap? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: mix_key()] [Chaining Key] Is the old chaining key value zeroized when updated, preventing reconstruction of key derivation chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: initiate_connection()] [Empty Prologue] Is an empty prologue (b'') allowed, and could this enable session confusion between different contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: write_message_in_place()] [Empty Message] Can zero-length messages be encrypted, and do they produce distinguishable ciphertexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/noise.rs] [Function: read_message_in_place()] [Minimum Size] Is the minimum message size check (AES_GCM_TAGLEN) sufficient, or could edge cases allow smaller messages? (Low)",
