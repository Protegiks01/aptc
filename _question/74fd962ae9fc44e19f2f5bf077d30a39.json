  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash-based cache lookup] If module cache lookups use only the hash (not full ModuleId), can an attacker exploit hash collisions to cause cache misses or incorrect module retrieval, breaking transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Cross-transaction interference] Can concurrent transactions accessing the same module cause race conditions in AptosModuleExtension usage, leading to one transaction executing with another's module version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Module replacement timing] Can an attacker time a module upgrade to occur between module cache retrieval and execution, causing some validators to execute the old version and others the new version, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Arc reference counting] Since extensions are wrapped in Arc for sharing, can an attacker create reference cycles or hold references indefinitely, preventing module garbage collection and causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Data race] Are all three fields (bytes, hash, state_value_metadata) protected from data races when accessed concurrently by multiple threads in parallel execution, or can unsynchronized access cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Can an attacker exploit a time-of-check-time-of-use race between StateValue retrieval from storage and AptosModuleExtension creation to substitute malicious module bytes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: bytes()] [Concurrent modification] While Bytes is supposed to be immutable, can an attacker exploit unsafe code or interior mutability to modify the bytes field while another thread is reading it, causing torn reads or corrupted execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Memory ordering] Does the struct ensure proper memory ordering guarantees (acquire/release semantics) when accessed across threads, or can relaxed atomics cause validators to observe inconsistent module states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash computation race] If sha3_256() at line 26 is not thread-safe or uses mutable global state, can concurrent hash computations for different modules produce incorrect or colliding hash values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Arc clone safety] When Arc<AptosModuleExtension> is cloned across threads, can the reference count overflow (on 32-bit systems) or wrap around, causing premature deallocation and use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: state_value_metadata()] [Metadata visibility] Does the metadata reference returned by this method guarantee visibility of updates made by other threads, or can stale metadata cause incorrect gas calculations in concurrent execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Upgrade atomicity] During module upgrades, can a partially-updated AptosModuleExtension be observed where bytes are from the new version but metadata is from the old version (or vice versa), causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Version transition] When a module is upgraded, can attackers exploit the transition period where different validators have cached different AptosModuleExtension versions, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Downgrade attack] Can an attacker force validators to use an old AptosModuleExtension version after a security patch, re-introducing previously fixed vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: bytes()] [Bytecode compatibility] When modules are upgraded, does the extension validate that new bytecode is backward compatible with existing dependencies, or can incompatible upgrades break dependent modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Metadata migration] When upgrading from V0 to V1 metadata format, can attackers exploit inconsistent state during migration to avoid paying increased storage fees for their modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: state_value_metadata()] [Gas undercharge] Can an attacker craft modules with manipulated metadata that causes the gas meter to undercharge for module storage, allowing unlimited module deployment without adequate payment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Deposit calculation overflow] Can an attacker create a StateValue with deposit values that cause integer overflow when computing storage refunds, allowing them to drain the gas refund pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Metadata-size mismatch] If metadata's bytes_deposit doesn't match actual bytes.len(), can this cause incorrect gas calculations that either undercharge (enabling spam) or overcharge (causing DoS) for module operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: state_value_metadata()] [Refund manipulation] Can an attacker repeatedly deploy and delete modules, exploiting rounding errors or metadata manipulation to receive refunds larger than deposits, effectively mining funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Free storage exploit] Can an attacker set both slot_deposit and bytes_deposit to zero in metadata, allowing them to store modules without paying any storage fees and exhausting validator disk space? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Creation time gaming] Can an attacker manipulate creation_time_usecs to exploit time-based storage fee discounts or to backdate modules and avoid increased fees from recent governance changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Storage corruption propagation] If the underlying StateValue is corrupted in storage, does the extension creation fail safely, or does it propagate corrupted data into the module cache causing Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: bytes()] [Disk space exhaustion] Can an attacker deploy modules with maximally-sized bytes fields to exhaust validator disk space, and does the metadata's bytes_deposit limit prevent this, or can it be bypassed? (High)",
