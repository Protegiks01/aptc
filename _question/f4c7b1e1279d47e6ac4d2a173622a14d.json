  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Impl: Arbitrary for ShellSafeName] [Fuzzing input validation] The Arbitrary implementation for property testing at lines 93-102 - does fuzzing coverage adequately test regex edge cases and boundary conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Impl: Arbitrary for TextLine] [Fuzzing completeness] TextLine's Arbitrary at lines 125-133 limits strings to 1024 chars - does this adequately test maximum length scenarios that could occur in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: ShellSafeName] [Clone semantics] ShellSafeName doesn't implement Clone - can this cause unnecessary re-validation when the same name needs to be used multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: TextLine] [Clone implementation] TextLine derives Clone at line 105 - does cloning properly duplicate the newline terminator, or can clones have inconsistent termination? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Enum: StorageOpt] [Serialization safety] StorageOpt doesn't derive Serialize/Deserialize - can this prevent proper configuration persistence or lead to manual serialization bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: DBToolStorageOpt] [Clone requirement] DBToolStorageOpt derives Clone at line 213 - is deep cloning of PathBuf and Options safe, or can clones share mutable state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Cross-backup poisoning] If multiple backups share storage infrastructure, can a malicious backup poison shared resources (connection pools, caches) affecting legitimate backups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Storage-level deduplication] If storage backends use deduplication, can attackers craft backup data that reveals information about other backups through timing or storage size analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Backup versioning] No version negotiation exists - can incompatible backup format changes cause old backups to become unreadable, preventing disaster recovery from historical snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Quantum-resistant backup] Are backup encryption schemes quantum-resistant, or can quantum adversaries decrypt archived backups containing historical transaction data and private information? (Low)",
