  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 107-108] [Type Conversion] Can the conversion from gas_scaling_factor to u64 and then f64 lose precision or overflow, causing incorrect scaling of all cost calculations in the report? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Multiple locations] [u64::from] Are all u64::from(InternalGas) and u64::from(Fee) conversions safe from overflow, or can malicious gas values exceed u64::MAX and cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 167-179] [Closure Capture] Can the convert_op closure capture incorrect values or have lifetime issues that cause incorrect cost reporting when processing aggregated operations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 365-371] [Write Ordering] Can the ordering of writes (SVGs before HTML) cause issues if the HTML references SVG files that don't exist yet, potentially exposing broken reports? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Function: generate_html_report()] [Cleanup on Error] If an error occurs during report generation, are partially written files cleaned up, or do they remain on disk potentially leaking information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Function: generate_html_report()] [Concurrency] Can multiple concurrent calls to generate_html_report() with the same path parameter cause file corruption, race conditions, or inconsistent reports? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 82-86] [Transaction Count] Can num_txns be zero or negative (if it's a signed type), causing division by zero or incorrect aggregation text in the report header? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 330-331] [Tree Mutation] Does the include_child_costs() mutation on the tree ensure data consistency, or can it cause double-counting or incorrect cost attribution in the execution trace? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 138] [Deep Clone] Does cloning dependencies vector perform a deep or shallow copy, and could this lead to use-after-free or data corruption if the original is modified? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 265] [Vector Clone] Can the clone() of write_set_storage cause excessive memory usage if the storage writes are extremely large, leading to OOM conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 301] [Events Clone] Does cloning the events vector maintain data integrity, or could concurrent modifications to the original cause race conditions or data corruption? (Low)",
