  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Global: NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL] [Thread thrashing] If concurrency_level exceeds actual CPU core count by 100x, can the excessive context switching overhead cause benchmarks to run slower than single-threaded mode, hiding real performance characteristics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Function: ThreadPoolBuilder::build()] [Blocking on creation] Creating thousands of threads at line 14-15 is a blocking synchronous operation - can this cause the entire benchmark process to hang for minutes during initialization if thread creation is slow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Global: NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL] [Unbounded queue] Rayon thread pools have unbounded work queues by default - can submitting millions of small tasks cause memory exhaustion by filling the queue faster than threads can process them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Integration: main.rs line 659] [Configuration race] When main.rs calls NativeConfig::set_concurrency_level_once(execution_threads_per_shard), can another thread simultaneously access NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL, triggering lazy initialization with default value 1 before the configuration completes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Integration: native_vm.rs line 99] [Pool poisoning] If thread pool panics during BlockSTM execution, the Arc<ThreadPool> reference in NativeVMBlockExecutor remains valid but the pool is poisoned - can subsequent execute_block() calls deadlock or corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Integration: parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs line 96,109] [Nested parallelism deadlock] When parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor calls NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL.install() twice (for parsing and execution), can this cause deadlock if pool size equals concurrency_level and all threads wait for subtasks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Integration: aptos_vm_uncoordinated.rs line 54] [Chain operation starvation] When AptosVMUncoordinated chains par_iter() operations on the same pool, can one iterator starve others if it generates unbounded work, causing benchmark timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Function: set_concurrency_level_once()] [Zero threads] Can setting concurrency_level to 0 cause Rayon to use num_cpus() as fallback, or will it panic with 'attempted to create pool with 0 threads', bypassing the intended configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Function: get_concurrency_level()] [Missing set] If set_concurrency_level_once() is never called but NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL is accessed, get_concurrency_level() returns 1 but the pool has already locked in this value - can this cause permanent single-threaded operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Global: NATIVE_EXECUTOR_POOL] [Empty pool edge case] If thread creation fails for some threads but not all during build(), can the pool end up with fewer threads than num_threads() specified, causing subtle performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_config.rs] [Function: OnceCell::set()] [ABA problem] If set_concurrency_level_once() is called, then NATIVE_EXECUTOR_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL is somehow cleared (via unsafe code), then set again, can this cause the pool to be misconfigured? (Low)"
