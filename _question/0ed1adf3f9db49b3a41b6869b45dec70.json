  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Processor variant] [Null Handling] Does the optional() call at line 95 properly handle NULL values in the database, or can this cause unexpected panics or incorrect health status? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Processor variant] [Table Schema Assumption] Does the query assume the processor_status table schema is fixed, or can schema changes cause panics in the tuple destructuring at line 93? (Medium)",
