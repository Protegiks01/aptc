  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that cause unbounded memory allocation during deserialization of the String fields (collection_name, old_uri, new_uri), leading to validator node OOM crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type Confusion] Can malicious bytes be crafted to deserialize with incorrect field types or ordering, bypassing the expected struct layout and causing undefined behavior when the event is processed by indexers or APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer Overflow] Does BCS deserialization properly validate string length prefixes to prevent integer overflow attacks where an attacker provides max u64 length values causing wraparound and buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker emit events with extremely large string fields (e.g., multi-GB collection_name or URI strings) that pass BCS deserialization but cause downstream systems (indexers, APIs) to crash or exhaust disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Malformed Data] Does the function properly handle truncated or incomplete BCS byte streams, or can partial deserialization lead to use of uninitialized memory or corrupted event data propagating through the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error Handling] Does the error conversion from bcs::Error using Into::into preserve critical security-relevant error information, or can error details be lost allowing attackers to distinguish between different failure modes for information leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Denial of Service] Can repeated calls to try_from_bytes with deeply nested or recursive BCS structures cause stack overflow even though CollectionUriMutateEvent appears flat, potentially through malicious AccountAddress encoding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Input Validation] Does the struct enforce any maximum length constraints on collection_name, old_uri, or new_uri fields, or can attackers create events with arbitrarily long strings causing state bloat and storage exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Encoding Attack] Can collection_name or URI fields contain null bytes, control characters, or invalid UTF-8 sequences that cause parsing failures, injection attacks, or crashes in downstream consumers like indexers or frontends? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [URI Validation] Are the old_uri and new_uri fields validated as proper URI format, or can attackers inject malicious URIs (javascript:, data:, file: schemes) that could exploit frontend applications or cause SSRF attacks in indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Unicode Normalization] Can attackers use Unicode homograph attacks or non-normalized Unicode in collection_name to create visually identical but distinct collection identifiers, enabling phishing or collection impersonation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Path Traversal] Can the URI fields contain path traversal sequences (../, ..\\) that could be exploited by systems attempting to download or cache collection metadata, allowing directory traversal attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [XSS Injection] Can URI or collection_name fields contain JavaScript code or HTML that gets rendered unsanitized in explorer UIs, enabling stored XSS attacks against users viewing collection events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [SQL Injection] If the event data is stored in SQL databases by indexers, can the string fields contain SQL injection payloads (quotes, semicolons, comments) that could compromise indexer database security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Address Validation] Does the AccountAddress type enforce proper validation to prevent use of reserved system addresses (0x0, 0x1, 0x3-0xa) as creator_addr, which could bypass access controls or impersonate system collections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Address Collision] Can an attacker create events with deliberately colliding AccountAddress values (through hash collision or birthday attacks) to associate their URI mutations with legitimate creators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Field: creator_addr] [Zero Address] Does the event allow creator_addr to be the zero address (0x0), potentially enabling creation of unauthorized system events or bypassing creator-based access controls in consuming systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation Bypass] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on input parameters, or can it be called with invalid data (empty strings, mismatched URIs, system addresses) that violates expected invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Leak] Can repeated calls to new() with large string allocations cause memory fragmentation or resource exhaustion, especially in high-throughput scenarios with many URI mutation events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new()] [State Consistency] Does new() ensure that old_uri and new_uri are different, or can attackers create no-op mutation events where both URIs are identical, potentially for spam or state pollution attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: creator_addr()] [Reference Safety] Does returning &AccountAddress create potential for use-after-free if the event struct is dropped while references are still held, especially in concurrent processing scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: collection_name()] [String Reference] Can the returned &String reference be exploited in scenarios where the underlying String is mutated through interior mutability, causing race conditions or inconsistent reads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: old_uri()] [Data Exposure] Does returning a reference to old_uri expose potentially sensitive metadata about collection history that should be restricted or redacted in certain contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Function: new_uri()] [Unvalidated Access] Can consumers of new_uri() assume the returned URI has been validated, or must they perform their own validation to prevent exploitation of malicious URI content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module Name Mismatch] Can the hardcoded MODULE_NAME 'token_event_store' be manipulated or confused with other modules, causing type confusion when events are deserialized or processed by the Move VM?
