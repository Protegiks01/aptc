  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: verify()] [Author-index mismatch] Does verify() check that the author in the SecretShare corresponds to the validator who should possess the SecretKeyShare for that index, or can a validator submit another validator's share with their own author field? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: get_id()] [Validator set staleness] If the ValidatorVerifier's address_to_validator_index mapping is stale from a previous epoch, can an attacker exploit the outdated mapping to cause incorrect index lookups and verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: verify()] [Byzantine validator shares] Can a Byzantine validator that controls multiple validator identities submit shares for all controlled validators to manipulate the threshold and compromise the secret sharing scheme? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShareConfig] [Author field unused] The _author field in SecretShareConfig is unused (line 137) - is there missing validation logic that should verify shares come from authorized authors based on this field? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: get_peer_weight()] [Weight bypass] The function always returns 1 (line 197) regardless of the peer, but a weights HashMap exists - can an attacker exploit this mismatch to manipulate weighted threshold calculations in the FPTXWeighted scheme? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: get_peer_weights()] [Empty weights] The weights HashMap is initialized as empty (line 168) and never populated - does this cause the weighted threshold encryption scheme to fail or fall back to equal-weight mode, weakening security guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShareConfig] [Weight inconsistency] If FPTXWeighted expects weighted validators but get_peer_weight() returns uniform weights, can this cause mismatches between the threshold config and actual validation, enabling threshold manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing weight initialization] Should the SecretShareConfig constructor populate the weights HashMap based on validator stake amounts, and if so, does the current implementation create a security vulnerability by not initializing weights? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Verification keys length] Is there validation that verification_keys.len() equals the number of validators in the ValidatorVerifier, or can mismatched lengths cause index out-of-bounds in verify()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Config tampering] Can a malicious node provide a modified ThresholdConfig with altered threshold or n values when constructing SecretShareConfig, compromising the security of the secret sharing scheme? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Master secret key leakage] The msk_share (MasterSecretKeyShare) is stored in plaintext - is there risk of memory dumps or side-channel attacks leaking this critical cryptographic material during validator operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Digest key reuse] Can the same digest_key be reused across multiple epochs or rounds, enabling cross-context attacks where shares from different encryption instances are maliciously combined? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Encryption key rotation] Is there proper validation that encryption_key is rotated between epochs, or can key reuse enable cryptographic attacks that break the semantic security of the threshold encryption scheme? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShareConfig] [Arc clone safety] The ValidatorVerifier is wrapped in Arc - can concurrent modification of the underlying verifier during validator set changes cause race conditions in get_id() or verification operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: new() - SecretShareConfig] [Epoch field unused] The _epoch field is unused (line 138) - is there missing epoch validation logic that should prevent cross-epoch share mixing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: verify()] [Cross-epoch replay] Can an attacker capture valid SecretShares from epoch N and replay them in epoch N+1 if the verification_keys are reused, bypassing proper epoch-specific validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: aggregate()] [Share resubmission] Can the same SecretShare be submitted multiple times in different aggregation attempts, enabling an attacker to influence which shares are used in reconstruction by timing their submission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: verify()] [Round replay] If rounds reset or wrap around, can shares from round N be replayed in a future round N+M*period, causing validators to accept outdated cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShare] [Clone attack] The SecretKeyShare is cloned in multiple places - can an attacker obtain a clone and use it to create multiple SecretShare instances with different metadata, enabling vote multiplication attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: share()] [Reference exposure] The share() getter returns a reference to the internal SecretKeyShare - can this enable unintended mutations or lifetime issues if the share is held beyond the SecretShare's lifetime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShareConfig] [Concurrent verification] If multiple threads call verify() concurrently with the same SecretShareConfig, can race conditions in accessing verification_keys or the ValidatorVerifier cause non-deterministic verification results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: aggregate()] [Iterator race] If the iterator passed to aggregate() is being modified concurrently by another thread, can this cause non-deterministic selection of shares for threshold reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: get_id()] [Verifier modification] If the ValidatorVerifier's address_to_validator_index mapping is updated during epoch transitions while get_id() is being called, can this cause races leading to incorrect index values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Struct: SecretShareConfig] [Clone safety] The Clone implementation creates shared references via Arc - can concurrent cloning during validator operations cause reference counting issues or unexpected data sharing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/secret_sharing.rs] [Function: threshold()] [U64 cast overflow] When casting threshold from usize to u64, can large threshold values on 128-bit systems overflow, causing the returned threshold to wrap around to a small value that compromises security? (High)"
