  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Permission Checks] Does the function verify file permissions to ensure the config file hasn't been tampered with (world-writable), which could allow attackers to modify faucet behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Insufficient Error Context] Do the error messages provide enough information for operators to debug issues without exposing sensitive paths or configuration details to potential attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Error Side Effects] If validation fails partway through, are there any partial state changes or file descriptors that aren't properly cleaned up? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Panic on Invalid UTF-8] Does to_string_lossy() at lines 21 and 28 handle invalid UTF-8 in paths correctly, or could specially crafted paths cause panics or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Node URL Connectivity Check] Does validation verify that the configured node_url in ApiConnectionConfig is actually reachable and responding, or will the faucet fail only at runtime when trying to submit transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Chain ID Mismatch Detection] Does validation query the node API to verify the configured chain_id matches the actual chain, preventing catastrophic cross-network transaction submissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Private Key Validation] Does validation actually test-load and verify the private key from key_file_path can sign transactions, or could invalid/corrupted keys only be discovered when the faucet tries to mint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Mint Account Address Check] For MintFunderConfig, does validation verify the mint_account_address exists on-chain and has minting capabilities before starting the service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Account Balance Validation] For TransferFunder, does validation check that the funder account has sufficient balance to actually fund requests, preventing service startup with insufficient funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Conflicting Config Detection] Does validation detect conflicting settings like wait_for_transactions=true with very short transaction_expiration_secs causing guaranteed timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Async Safety] Is the async function at line 17 cancel-safe, or could cancellation during file I/O or YAML parsing leave resources in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [BufReader Size] Does BufReader at line 24 use a reasonable buffer size, or could very long lines in YAML cause excessive memory allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Struct: ValidateConfig] [Clone Safety] Is the Clone derive at line 10 safe for ValidateConfig given it contains a PathBuf, or could cloning cause unexpected behavior with path references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [API Key Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious values into api_key field that cause header injection vulnerabilities when the faucet makes API requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Header Injection] Does validation check additional_headers in ApiConnectionConfig for control characters or newlines that could enable HTTP request smuggling attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [URL Validation] Does validation ensure node_url uses HTTPS (not HTTP) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on faucet-to-node communication, potentially allowing transaction interception or modification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [SSRF via Node URL] Can an attacker configure node_url to point to internal services (localhost, 169.254.169.254) enabling server-side request forgery to access internal APIs or metadata services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [Validation Performance] Does repeated validation of complex configs (e.g., hundreds of checker_configs) consume excessive CPU/memory, enabling DoS by forcing frequent re-validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/validate_config.rs] [Function: validate_config()] [No Timeout on File Read] Does the File::open() and BufReader::read operations have timeouts, or could reading from slow/blocked filesystems (NFS, network mounts) hang validation indefinitely? (Medium)",
