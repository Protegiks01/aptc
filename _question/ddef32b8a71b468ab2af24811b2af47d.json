  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Input Validation] Does the asset_uploader_worker_uri field lack URI validation, allowing malicious operators to configure invalid URIs (e.g., file://, data://, javascript:) that could lead to SSRF attacks when the worker client makes requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [SSRF Vulnerability] Can an attacker with config access set asset_uploader_worker_uri to internal network addresses (e.g., http://localhost:8080, http://169.254.169.254) to probe internal services or cloud metadata endpoints when upload requests are made? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [URL Injection] Does the asset_uploader_worker_uri allow path traversal characters (../, ..\\) or special URL encoding that could be exploited to access unintended worker endpoints beyond the intended upload API? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Protocol Confusion] Is there validation preventing mixed protocols in asset_uploader_worker_uri (e.g., switching from https:// to http://) that could downgrade security and expose upload requests to man-in-the-middle attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [DNS Rebinding] Can the asset_uploader_worker_uri be set to a domain vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks, where the DNS resolution changes mid-request to redirect uploads to attacker-controlled servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_interval_seconds] [DoS - Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker with config access set poll_interval_seconds to 0 or extremely low values (e.g., 1) to trigger a tight polling loop that exhausts database connections and CPU resources, causing service degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_interval_seconds] [Integer Overflow] Could poll_interval_seconds set to u64::MAX cause integer overflow when converted to Duration or multiplied in timeout calculations, leading to unexpected behavior or panics in the polling loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Function: default_poll_interval_seconds] [Weak Default] Is the default poll interval of 10 seconds too aggressive for production deployments, potentially causing unnecessary database load or API rate limiting under high load conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_interval_seconds] [Liveness Issue] Can setting poll_interval_seconds to an extremely high value (e.g., 86400 seconds) effectively disable the polling mechanism, causing legitimate asset upload requests to be delayed indefinitely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_rows_limit] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker set poll_rows_limit to u64::MAX or extremely large values (e.g., billions) to force the service to load massive result sets from Postgres, exhausting memory and causing OOM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_rows_limit] [Database Overload] Does poll_rows_limit lack an upper bound check, allowing configurations that could trigger expensive full table scans or lock the asset_uploader_request_statuses table for extended periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Function: default_poll_rows_limit] [Queue Flooding] Is the default poll_rows_limit of 600 appropriate, or could it be exploited by flooding the database with fake upload requests that continuously fill the queue faster than they can be processed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_rows_limit] [Integer Casting] When poll_rows_limit (u64) is cast to i64 for the SQL LIMIT clause, can values greater than i64::MAX cause negative limits or query failures that break the polling mechanism? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_hash] [Credential Exposure] Does the cloudflare_account_hash lack protection against accidental logging or serialization into debug outputs, potentially exposing Cloudflare account identifiers in application logs or error traces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_hash] [Input Validation] Is there validation ensuring cloudflare_account_hash matches the expected format (e.g., alphanumeric hash), or can arbitrary strings be injected that break CDN URL construction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Secret Management] Are sensitive Cloudflare credentials (account_hash, image_delivery_prefix) stored in plaintext config files without encryption or secrets management integration, risking exposure through config file leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_hash] [Path Traversal] Can the cloudflare_account_hash contain path traversal sequences (../) that break URL construction when formatted into CDN image URIs, potentially accessing wrong accounts or causing 404 errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix] [URL Injection] Does cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix lack validation to ensure it's a valid HTTPS URL, allowing attackers to inject HTTP URLs that expose CDN image traffic to interception? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix] [Domain Spoofing] Can cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix be set to attacker-controlled domains (e.g., evil.com) to redirect all CDN image URLs to malicious servers serving counterfeit NFT assets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix] [Protocol Downgrade] Is there enforcement that cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix uses HTTPS, or can it be configured with HTTP, exposing CDN image delivery URLs to MITM attacks and content tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix] [Trailing Slash] Does improper handling of trailing slashes in cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix cause malformed CDN URLs (e.g., double slashes: https://cdn.com//hash/id/variant) that could fail or return wrong assets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_default_variant] [Variant Injection] Can cloudflare_default_variant contain arbitrary strings including path separators or special characters that break the CDN URL format: {prefix}/{hash}/{id}/{variant}? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_default_variant] [Missing Validation] Does the code validate that cloudflare_default_variant corresponds to an actually configured Cloudflare Image Variant, or can invalid variants cause all CDN image requests to return 404 errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Attribute: serde(deny_unknown_fields)] [Deserialization Strictness] While deny_unknown_fields prevents extra fields, does the lack of field-level validation allow malformed but parseable values (e.g., empty strings, whitespace-only) that cause runtime errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Unvalidated Input] Does serde deserialization directly accept any valid JSON/TOML without semantic validation, allowing nonsensical configs (e.g., negative values after parse, malformed URLs) to propagate into runtime? (Medium)"
