  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that cause memory exhaustion during deserialization by providing extremely large Vec<u8> authentication keys that bypass size limits, potentially causing validator nodes to crash or slow down consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does the BCS deserialization properly validate the length prefix of the authentication key vectors, or can an attacker provide a malicious length value that triggers integer overflow when allocating memory, leading to buffer overflows or denial of service? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker supply BCS bytes that deserialize into a KeyRotation struct with mismatched field types or incorrect struct layout, bypassing Move's type safety and causing undefined behavior in the VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource exhaustion] Is there a maximum size limit enforced on the authentication_key vectors during deserialization, or can an attacker create KeyRotation events with multi-megabyte key values that consume excessive storage and memory across all validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic vulnerability] What happens if bcs::from_bytes() encounters malformed data - does it panic or return an error, and could a malicious actor trigger validator crashes by emitting events with corrupted serialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error information leakage] Does the error propagation from bcs::from_bytes() expose sensitive information about internal state or memory layout that could be exploited to craft more sophisticated attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Recursive deserialization] Can nested or recursive data structures be embedded in the BCS bytes that cause stack overflow during deserialization, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Encoding mismatch] Is there validation that the BCS encoding matches the expected Move module structure, or can an attacker provide bytes from a different struct type that gets incorrectly interpreted as KeyRotation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key validation bypass] Does the KeyRotation struct enforce any constraints on authentication key length or format, or can an attacker emit events with empty, oversized, or malformed keys that break downstream validation logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key equality attack] Can an attacker create a KeyRotation event where old_authentication_key equals new_authentication_key, potentially bypassing rotation logic or creating fake rotation events without actually changing keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Zero-length keys] Are zero-length authentication keys (empty Vec<u8>) properly rejected, or can an attacker rotate to an empty key that makes the account uncontrollable and causes permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Oversized keys] Is there a maximum key length enforced, or can an attacker provide multi-megabyte authentication keys in the event that consume excessive storage in the OriginatingAddress table and event logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key format validation] Does the KeyRotation event validate that authentication keys follow the expected 32-byte format derived from public key hashes, or can arbitrary byte sequences be used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Duplicate rotation] Can an attacker emit multiple KeyRotation events with identical old and new keys to spam event logs or manipulate event-based indexers without actually performing valid rotations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key collision] Can an attacker craft authentication keys that collide with existing keys in the OriginatingAddress mapping, potentially hijacking wallet recovery for other accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Invalid account address] Is there validation that the account field contains a valid, existing account address, or can fake events be created for non-existent accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] Can an attacker exploit the hardcoded MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME to create type confusion by defining a different struct with the same identifiers in another module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type parameter injection] Since KeyRotation has no type parameters, can an attacker craft events that appear to have type arguments, bypassing type safety checks in the Move VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version confusion] Does the MoveEventV2Type implementation properly distinguish this from the legacy KeyRotationEvent, or can an attacker cause confusion between event versions to manipulate event processing? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Static: KEY_ROTATION_TYPE] [Module address spoofing] Does the KEY_ROTATION_TYPE properly enforce that events come from CORE_CODE_ADDRESS, or can malicious modules at different addresses emit fake KeyRotation events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Static: KEY_ROTATION_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Is the Lazy<TypeTag> initialization thread-safe in concurrent scenarios, or can race conditions during first access cause inconsistent type tags across validators? (High)",
