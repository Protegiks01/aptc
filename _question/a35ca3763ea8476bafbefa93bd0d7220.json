  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key material persistence] Can a malicious validator exploit race conditions in save_key_pair_bytes() to overwrite epoch key pairs during epoch transitions, causing randomness generation failures that halt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Epoch confusion] Does save_key_pair_bytes() validate that the epoch parameter matches the current epoch, or can an attacker save future/past epoch keys that get loaded during recovery, causing validators to use wrong keys for randomness generation leading to consensus fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key material leakage] Can save_key_pair_bytes() fail to securely clear key_pair bytes from memory after storage, allowing attackers with memory access to extract DKG private keys and break randomness unpredictability?

(High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Atomicity violation] Does save_key_pair_bytes() ensure atomic writes, or can crashes during save leave partially written keys that cause silent corruption when loaded, leading to byzantine randomness generation?

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key replacement attack] Can concurrent calls to save_key_pair_bytes() with different epoch values create race conditions where newer keys overwrite older keys before they're properly used, causing randomness protocol failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Error handling bypass] Can implementations silently ignore save_key_pair_bytes() errors (returning Ok despite failure), causing validators to believe keys are persisted when they're not, leading to loss of randomness data on restart?

(Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Missing verification] Does save_aug_data() validate the cryptographic integrity of AugData (delta values, signatures) before persisting, or can corrupted/malicious data be stored that breaks randomness generation when loaded? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Memory exhaustion] Can repeated calls to save_aug_data() with unique AugDataIds cause unbounded storage growth, leading to disk exhaustion that crashes validator nodes and causes consensus halt? (High)",
