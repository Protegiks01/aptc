  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Config enumeration] Uses enumerate() for index-based voting power - is this index stable after sorting? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Safety rules config] sr_test_config.author and consensus_key are extracted - could missing test configs cause unwrap panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [ValidatorInfo construction] new_with_test_network_keys() is used - does this match production validator setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Voting power] All validators get voting_power = 1 - could equal voting power hide vote weighting bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Proposer index mapping] round_proposers_idx maps round to validator index - could out-of-bounds index cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Twin iteration] Twins are added by cloning configs for first num_twins validators - could this cause unexpected twin-original validator pairs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [SMR node iteration] into_iter() consumes node_configs - is there guarantee of execution order? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [MockStorage per node] Each node gets fresh MockStorage - could this hide bugs requiring shared storage state? (Low)",

  "[File: consensus/src/twins/twins_node.rs] [Function: start_num_nodes_with_twins()] [Config mutation] config fields are mutated (as_mut().unwrap()) - could mutation failures cause inconsistent test state? (Medium)"
