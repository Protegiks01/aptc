(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_system_info()] [Partial failure] If one of the four collection functions panics at lines 64-67, does the entire telemetry collection fail, or can partial system information still be collected and sent? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Global: GLOBAL_SYSTEM] [Initialization race] Can concurrent first accesses to GLOBAL_SYSTEM at line 36 cause race conditions in Lazy initialization, leading to multiple System::new_all() invocations or partial initialization states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Global: GLOBAL_SYSTEM] [Initialization panic] If System::new_all() panics during Lazy initialization at line 36, does this permanently prevent all telemetry collection, hiding critical system issues from validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Global: GLOBAL_SYSTEM] [Initialization cost] Is the System::new_all() call at line 36 expensive enough that first access to GLOBAL_SYSTEM causes unexpected delays in validator startup or initial telemetry collection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_cpu_info()] [String conversion] Can the to_string() conversions at lines 78, 84, 90 fail or panic for edge case values (e.g., extremely large numbers), causing telemetry collection to abort? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_disk_info()] [String conversion] Can the to_string() conversions at lines 106, 129, 133 fail for u64::MAX or other extreme values, causing incomplete disk information collection? (Low)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Global: GLOBAL_SYSTEM] [Mutex type] Is using aptos_infallible::Mutex at line 5 instead of std::sync::Mutex appropriate for GLOBAL_SYSTEM, or can the infallible guarantees hide lock poisoning errors that should be handled?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_system_info()] [Atomic snapshot] Does collect_system_info() provide an atomic snapshot of system state, or can interleaved refresh and read operations at lines 60-67 result in inconsistent telemetry where CPU data is from time T1 but disk data is from time T2? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_cpu_info()] [Stale data] If refresh_system() at line 60 fails silently, can collect_cpu_info() at line 64 return stale CPU information from previous refresh cycles, leading to misleading validator health metrics?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/system_information.rs] [Function: collect_cpu_info()] [Platform behavior] Can physical_core_count() at line 82-84 return None on some platforms but Some on others, causing telemetry schema inconsistencies across validators running on different operating systems?
