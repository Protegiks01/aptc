  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [State migration] If genesis needs to be rerun or modified (e.g., for testnet reset), is there proper cleanup of the old GenesisStateView state, or could residual state cause corruption in the new genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Module publishing] Does the genesis process bypass normal module publishing restrictions, and if so, are there safeguards to prevent this bypass from being exploited to publish unauthorized modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Rust] [Integer overflow] In scenarios where many modules are added, could the HashMap size calculations overflow, leading to memory corruption or incorrect capacity allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Rust] [Borrow checker bypass] Are there any patterns in the code where mutable and immutable borrows could be held simultaneously through unsafe code or interior mutability, potentially causing data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Rust] [Panic safety] If any of the assert! or assert_some! macros panic during genesis, is the panic properly caught and handled, or could it leave the validator in an inconsistent state requiring manual recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Rust] [Unsafe code] While the file has #![forbid(unsafe_code)], are there any dependencies that use unsafe code which could violate memory safety guarantees during genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Rust] [Drop implementation] Does GenesisStateView have a custom Drop implementation, and if so, could it fail to properly clean up resources, leading to resource leaks or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Bytecode verification] Before modules are inserted into state_data, is there bytecode verification to ensure they don't contain invalid opcodes or malformed structures that could crash the MoveVM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Type system bypass] Can the direct module insertion via add_module() bypass Move's type system checks, allowing modules with type safety violations to be deployed during genesis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Resource safety] Does the genesis context respect Move's resource safety guarantees, or could modules be added that violate resource linearity, enabling duplication of valuable resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Module compatibility] Are modules inserted during genesis checked for compatibility with the MoveVM version used by validators, or could version mismatches cause execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Gas semantics] During genesis transaction execution, does the zero storage usage affect gas metering in ways that could allow infinite loops or unbounded computation in genesis scripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [MoveVM] [Global storage] Can genesis modules access or modify global storage before it's properly initialized, potentially causing undefined behavior or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Crypto] [Merkle tree] Does the genesis state properly initialize the Jellyfish Merkle tree, ensuring that all validators compute identical state roots that match the committed genesis hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Crypto] [State commitment] Is there a mechanism to verify that the final genesis state commitment matches a pre-agreed hash, preventing validators from starting with different genesis states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Crypto] [Module hashing] Are modules hashed in a deterministic way for state commitment, or could different hash orderings cause validators to have semantically identical but cryptographically different genesis states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Consensus] [Validator set] Does genesis properly initialize the validator set with correct stake amounts and public keys, or could errors in genesis data lead to consensus failures at block 1? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Consensus] [Epoch 0] Does the genesis state correctly set up epoch 0 parameters, ensuring that the first epoch transition occurs at the expected block height without causing network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Economics] [Initial supply] Does genesis properly initialize the total APT supply and distribution, or could errors lead to inflation exploits or incorrect economic parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Economics] [Treasury] Does genesis correctly fund the on-chain treasury and set up governance parameters, preventing unauthorized access to community funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Governance] [Proposal system] Are governance proposal parameters correctly initialized during genesis, or could incorrect thresholds enable governance takeover by small stakeholders? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Governance] [Feature flags] Does genesis properly initialize feature flags to their intended states, preventing premature activation of experimental features or disabling of critical security features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Edge case] [Empty genesis] What happens if no modules are added to GenesisStateView before it's used - does this cause validators to start with completely empty state, and if so, how is this detected and prevented? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Edge case] [Duplicate modules] If add_module() is called twice with identical module_id and blob, does the second call silently succeed, potentially masking errors in genesis script execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Edge case] [Partial genesis] If the genesis process is interrupted mid-execution (e.g., validator crash), is there proper recovery mechanism or will validators be stuck in an inconsistent state requiring full reset? (High)"
