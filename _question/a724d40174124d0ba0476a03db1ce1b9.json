  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateResponse] [Author consistency] Is there validation that ObservedUpdateResponse.update.author matches the network sender, or can validators proxy responses for other validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdate] [Authorization per issuer] Are validators authorized to observe JWKs for all issuers, or should there be per-issuer access control to prevent unauthorized key updates? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Issuer validation missing] Is the Issuer in ProviderJWKs validated against a whitelist of approved OIDC providers, or can arbitrary issuers be added to the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdate] [KID length attack] Can unbounded KID string length cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion when storing or comparing key identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateRequest] [Case sensitivity] Are Issuer comparisons case-sensitive, and can attackers exploit case differences to bypass rate limiting or create duplicate issuer entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [Missing KID] Can ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest be created with empty or null KID, causing key lookups to fail or return wrong keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Issuer URL manipulation] If Issuer contains URLs, can attackers use URL manipulation (path traversal, query parameters) to bypass issuer validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [KID wildcard abuse] Can wildcard or regex patterns in KID be exploited to match multiple keys simultaneously, causing batch updates with single signature? (High)",
