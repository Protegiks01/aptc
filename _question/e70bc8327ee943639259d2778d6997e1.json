  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Initialization order] Can race conditions or initialization order dependencies between lines 10-15 cause non-deterministic failures where the CLI works sometimes but fails other times due to concurrent initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource cleanup] Does the main() function properly clean up resources if move_cli() fails, or can repeated CLI invocations leak memory, file handles, or other resources when errors occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency tampering] Can an attacker compromise the move_stdlib dependency to inject malicious natives through all_natives() or nursery_natives() on lines 12-14, executing arbitrary code with CLI privileges when developers run move-cli commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Build-time attacks] If the move_vm_test_utils dependency on line 10 is compromised, can malicious cost tables be injected to cause incorrect gas calculations that hide DoS vulnerabilities or enable resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Version confusion] Does the main.rs entry point enforce compatible versions between move-stdlib, move-cli, and move-vm-test-utils, or can version mismatches cause undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Code injection] Can environment variables or command-line arguments affect the initialization on lines 10-17 in ways that allow code injection or modification of security-critical parameters like gas costs or native function addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [VM isolation] Does the move_cli invocation on line 17 properly isolate the Move VM execution environment, or can malicious Move code escape the sandbox to access host filesystem, network, or process memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type safety bypass] Can the combination of zero gas parameters and empty changeset on lines 12-17 somehow bypass Move's type safety guarantees, allowing invalid type operations that could corrupt VM state or cause memory unsafety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource safety] With the current initialization, can Move code violate resource safety invariants (double-spend resources, destroy resources without drop capability) during CLI execution, suggesting potential bugs in production deployment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode verification] Does move_cli() called on line 17 perform full bytecode verification including bounds checking, type checking, and resource safety verification, or can malicious bytecode bypass verifier checks during CLI testing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent execution] If multiple move-cli processes run concurrently using this main() entry point, can shared state or global variables in the cost_table or natives collection on lines 10-15 cause race conditions or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Static initialization] Is the INITIAL_COST_SCHEDULE on line 10 lazily initialized in a thread-safe manner, or can race conditions during first access cause undefined behavior or inconsistent cost table state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Reentrancy] Can native functions registered on lines 12-14 be called recursively or reentrantly during Move code execution, potentially causing stack overflows or infinite recursion that crashes the CLI? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Address collision] Is the hardcoded '0x1' address on line 11 guaranteed to be unique for framework natives, or could user-deployed Move modules attempt to register natives at the same address, causing conflicts or privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory layout] Does the natives collection on line 15 have a bounded size, or can an attacker craft dependencies that register unlimited natives causing memory exhaustion during CLI initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Pointer safety] Are all native function pointers in the collection on lines 12-15 validated for safety, or could corrupted function pointers cause arbitrary code execution if the natives Vec is tampered with? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Production parity] Does the CLI configuration on lines 10-17 accurately reflect production Aptos VM initialization, or do differences in gas parameters, native functions, or genesis state create false confidence in tested code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Feature flag mismatch] Can Move code tested with this CLI configuration pass tests but fail in production due to missing feature flags, different VM versions, or protocol upgrades not reflected in the test environment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Network simulation] Since the CLI uses simplified initialization, can network-dependent Move code (time-based logic, randomness, validator sets) behave incorrectly in production after passing CLI tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Cryptographic operations] Do native functions registered on lines 12-14 include cryptographic operations that could have implementation vulnerabilities (weak randomness, timing attacks, side-channels) exploitable during CLI execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integer overflow] Can zero gas costs on lines 12-14 allow unbounded integer operations in Move code that would normally be limited by gas, potentially causing integer overflows or underflows that corrupt state?
