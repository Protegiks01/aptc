  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Fork Conditions] Could non-deterministic deduplication behavior cause validators to execute different sets of transactions, leading to state divergence and chain forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Censorship via Duplication] Can an attacker front-run legitimate transactions by submitting duplicates with invalid signatures first, causing the deduper to filter out the legitimate ones later in the block? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 14-17] [Signature Verification Bypass] The comment explicitly states signatures are NOT verified before dedup - can this be exploited to include transactions that will definitely fail verification but still consume dedup resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Gas Price Manipulation] Since deduplication happens before gas validation, can an attacker submit the same transaction multiple times with different gas prices to bypass dedup and force validators to validate all copies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Free Resource Consumption] Can attackers submit blocks full of duplicate transactions that consume validator CPU for hash calculation without paying gas (since duplicates are filtered before execution)? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 24-25] [Hash Calculation Cost] The comment notes hash calculation is expensive - can this be weaponized to slow down specific validators by sending them blocks with maximal possible duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Mempool Interaction] If transactions are deduplicated at consensus but not in mempool, can validators receive the same transaction through multiple paths and process it multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Block Proposal Integration] When a validator proposes a block, does it run dedup before or after block creation? Could this create timing windows for duplicate insertion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Transaction Verification Order] Since dedup happens before signature verification, what's the security impact if a transaction passes dedup but later fails verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 68] [Hash Algorithm Security] What hash algorithm does committed_hash() use, and are there known collision attacks that could allow duplicate transactions to pass through? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup()] [Sequence Number Reuse] If two transactions have the same sender and sequence number but different contents, are both correctly kept (as non-duplicates), or could one be incorrectly filtered? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 45] [Sender Address Validation] Does the sender() function handle all account types correctly (regular, multisig, resource accounts), or could account type confusion cause dedup errors? (Medium)",
