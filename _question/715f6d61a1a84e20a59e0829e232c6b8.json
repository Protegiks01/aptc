  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Mixed Case Acronyms] For 'IOError' vs 'IoError', does camel_to_snake() produce the same output, and could this cause intentional collision attacks by adversaries choosing specific capitalizations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Uppercase Sequences] At line 10, when !first && c.is_uppercase(), does consecutive uppercase handling create exponential underscore insertion that could cause DoS during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Capacity Calculation - Line 7] String::with_capacity(text.len()) may be insufficient when to_lowercase() expands characters - can this cause repeated reallocation during string building, creating compile-time DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Character Extension - Line 12,15] The extend() calls for lowercase characters may iterate multiple times per character for some Unicode points - can this cause quadratic time complexity for specially crafted inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Iterator Allocation] Does the chars() iterator at line 9 allocate intermediate buffers for Unicode normalization that could exhaust memory for extremely long type names? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Closure Allocation - Line 9] The for_each closure captures mutable references - can this prevent compiler optimizations and cause performance degradation in macro expansion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [First Flag Reset] The 'first' boolean at line 8 is only set to false at line 14 in the else if branch - can specific character sequences bypass this, causing the flag to remain true and corrupt output? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Branch Coverage] The three-branch structure at lines 10-18 (uppercase, first, else) - are there character combinations that don't match any branch, causing characters to be silently dropped? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Short-Circuit Logic] The condition '!first && c.is_uppercase()' at line 10 - can the short-circuit evaluation be exploited to bypass uppercase handling when first=true? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Else Branch - Line 16-18] The final else branch at line 16-18 only pushes the character unchanged - can this allow special characters like numbers or underscores to pass through, creating invalid Rust identifiers? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Underscore Handling] Input like 'My_Type' already contains underscores - does the function double underscores or handle them incorrectly, producing 'my__type' that conflicts with 'MyType'? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Number Characters] For 'Type2Name', do numbers pass through the else branch unchanged, producing 'type2_name', and can this be exploited to create collisions with 'Type_2Name'? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hyphen and Dash] Can type names with hyphens 'My-Type' pass through to create invalid Rust identifiers in the generated hasher code? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Period Characters] Do dots in namespaced types 'my.module.Type' get preserved, creating invalid static variable names like 'my.module.type_SEED'? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Dollar Signs] Can dollar signs in type names pass through unchanged and cause syntax errors or unexpected behavior in generated macro code? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Whitespace Characters] Do spaces or tabs in malformed type names get preserved, creating multi-word identifier names that break Rust syntax? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Null Bytes] Can null bytes (U+0000) in type names cause string truncation in C FFI boundaries or other unsafe operations downstream? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hash Preimage Attack] If an attacker can predict the snake_case output, can they craft type names that produce hasher seeds matching existing types, enabling hash collision attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Domain Separation Bypass] Can carefully chosen type names produce snake_case outputs that collide with system-reserved hasher names, breaking the domain separation security model? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Birthday Attack Amplification] With a limited character set output (lowercase + underscore), does the reduced entropy make birthday attacks against hasher seeds feasible with fewer type definitions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Determinism Guarantee] Is camel_to_snake() guaranteed to produce identical outputs across all Rust compiler versions, platforms, and Unicode versions - could non-determinism break consensus in distributed systems? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Rainbow Table] Can attackers precompute a rainbow table of snake_case outputs to quickly find collision-producing type names for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Keyword Collision] Can the output collide with Rust keywords like 'type', 'fn', 'let' when uppercased to TYPE_SEED, causing compilation errors in the generated macro code? (Medium)",
