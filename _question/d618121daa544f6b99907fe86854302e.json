  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/mod.rs] [Module visibility] Are all submodules (account_transactions, coin_activities, coin_balances, coin_infos, coin_supply, coin_utils, v2_fungible_asset_utils) intentionally exposed as public, or does this create unintended API surface area that could be exploited by malicious code importing these modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/mod.rs] [Module organization] Does the lack of re-exports or facade patterns mean that internal implementation details from submodules are directly exposed, potentially allowing external code to bypass intended abstraction boundaries in the indexer? (Low)"
