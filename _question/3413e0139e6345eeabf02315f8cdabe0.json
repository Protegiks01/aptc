  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Display] [Format string injection] In the Display implementation, can the message field contain format string specifiers that get interpreted if the status is later used in format! macros, enabling arbitrary memory reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Display] [Display buffer overflow] Does the fmt() implementation handle extremely long messages safely, or can buffer overflows occur when formatting status objects with multi-megabyte message strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Display] [Output determinism] Is the Display output deterministic across all validator nodes, or can locale or formatting differences cause consensus issues when status strings are used in cryptographic operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Display] [Error propagation] Can errors from write! calls in fmt() be silently ignored, causing incomplete status information to propagate and mask critical transaction rejection reasons? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Debug] [Information leakage] Does the Debug display for MempoolStatusCode expose sensitive internal information that attackers can use to fingerprint validator implementation versions and discover vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Function: fmt() Debug] [Debug consistency] Is the Debug output format stable across Rust compiler versions, or can changes in debug formatting break parsing logic that depends on specific status code string representations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: PartialOrd/Ord] [Status code ordering] Since MempoolStatusCode derives Ord based on enum discriminant values, can attackers exploit the ordering (Accepted < InvalidSeqNumber < ... < RejectedByFilter) to bypass priority queue logic in mempool transaction ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: PartialOrd/Ord] [Comparison attacks] Can malicious validators manipulate transaction ordering by crafting transactions with specific status codes that compare favorably, allowing frontrunning or transaction censorship? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: PartialOrd/Ord] [Sorting stability] If mempool uses status code ordering for transaction prioritization, can attackers submit transactions that rapidly change status codes to disrupt stable sorting and cause consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Status deduplication bypass] Can attackers create functionally equivalent transactions with slightly different status codes or messages to bypass mempool deduplication, filling the mempool with redundant transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: Hash] [Hash DoS] Since MempoolStatus implements Hash, can attackers craft status objects that all hash to the same bucket in HashMap-based mempool structures, degrading performance to O(n) and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Trait: Eq] [Message comparison cost] Does equality checking include the potentially large message string, causing expensive comparisons that enable timing attacks to infer transaction content or mempool state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [VM status mapping] When VmError(5) status is returned, is there proper validation that the underlying VM error is correctly mapped, or can attackers exploit status code mismatches to execute invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Sequence number bypass] Can attackers exploit the InvalidSeqNumber(1) status code by submitting transactions with manipulated sequence numbers that get incorrectly marked as valid in race conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Mempool capacity manipulation] Does the MempoolIsFull(2) status trigger proper backpressure, or can attackers exploit this to selectively DoS specific transaction types by filling mempool with low-priority transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Per-account limit bypass] Can the TooManyTransactions(3) status be bypassed by submitting transactions from multiple accounts controlled by the same attacker, circumventing per-account rate limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Gas price update attack] Can attackers exploit the InvalidUpdate(4) status code to frontrun legitimate gas price updates, causing original transactions to be rejected while attacker transactions proceed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Filter policy bypass] When RejectedByFilter(7) is returned, are there alternative submission paths that bypass the filter entirely, allowing malicious transactions to enter mempool despite filter rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Integration] [Unknown status handling] If UnknownStatus(6) is returned, does error handling properly prevent the transaction from being processed, or can undefined behavior result from unclear status semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Serialization] [Status code transmission] When MempoolStatusCode is transmitted over the network as u64, can bit flips or transmission errors cause critical status changes (e.g., Accepted to InvalidSeqNumber) without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Serialization] [Message encoding attack] Are status messages properly encoded for network transmission, or can attackers inject binary data that corrupts message framing and causes deserialization errors on receiving validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Serialization] [Status consistency] Can network latency or message reordering cause validators to receive status updates out-of-order, leading to inconsistent views of mempool state across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Serialization] [Versioning issues] If the status code enum is extended in future versions (adding code 8, 9, etc.), can old validators crash when receiving new status codes, causing network splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Concurrency] [Status update race] Can concurrent status updates to the same transaction in mempool cause race conditions where a transaction marked InvalidSeqNumber is later processed as Accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Concurrency] [Clone thread safety] When MempoolStatus objects are cloned across threads, can message string mutations in one thread affect clones in other threads, causing non-deterministic behavior? (Low)"
