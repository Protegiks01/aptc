(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/response.rs] [Struct: NodeInformationResponse] [Storage range attack] Can an attacker report lowest_available_version higher than highest_synced_version to create invalid storage ranges that crash state sync or trigger undefined behavior?

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/response.rs] [Struct: NodeInformationResponse] [Uptime spoofing] Can malicious peers report artificially high uptime Duration values to gain reputation or priority in peer selection, potentially directing traffic to attacker-controlled nodes?

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/response.rs] [Struct: NodeInformationResponse] [Default values] Does the Default implementation create NodeInformationResponse with zero/empty values that could be misinterpreted as valid synced state, enabling acceptance of uninitialized or malicious peer data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/response.rs] [TryFrom: LatencyPingResponse] [Type confusion] Can an attacker deliberately send the wrong response type to trigger UnexpectedResponseError, and are these errors properly handled to prevent panic or resource leaks in error paths?
