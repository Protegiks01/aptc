  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Determinism] [UTF-8 Validation] Can different UTF-8 validation implementations in String::from_utf8 cause convert_hex to behave differently across indexer nodes, leading to inconsistent data indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Determinism] [JSON Serialization Order] Does serde_json::to_value preserve HashMap insertion order in convert_bcs_propertymap, or can different key ordering cause non-deterministic JSON output across indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Determinism] [String Replace] Can the string replace operations in string_null_byte_replacement behave non-deterministically for certain Unicode edge cases, causing inconsistent null byte sanitization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Determinism] [Chrono Version] Does parse_timestamp depend on chrono library implementation details that could change across versions, potentially causing timestamp parsing inconsistencies after upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Type Confusion] [String vs Address] Can BCS-encoded addresses be misinterpreted as strings or vice versa in convert_bcs_hex when type annotation is manipulated, causing address validation bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Type Confusion] [Integer Type Confusion] Can u64 values overflow when incorrectly deserialized as u8 or u16 in convert_bcs_hex_new due to type code mismatch, causing silent truncation of large numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Type Confusion] [Bool vs Integer] Can integer values (2-255) be provided with bool type code (0) in convert_bcs_hex_new, bypassing boolean validation and storing invalid bool values in indexed data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Type Confusion] [PropertyMap Version Mixing] Can old PropertyMap format (with type strings) and new TokenObjectPropertyMap format (with type codes) be confused during deserialization, causing type misinterpretation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/util.rs] [Type Confusion] [Vector vs String] Can byte vectors (type 8) be confused with strings (type 9) after conversion in convert_bcs_hex_new, causing binary data to be interpreted as text? (Medium)"
