  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Error Propagation] At diag.rs:54-56, if query_sequence_number fails for one instance, does this cause the entire health check to fail, or are failures isolated per-instance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Chain ID Mismatch] If the emitter is configured with the wrong chain_id, can transactions be valid on both testnets and mainnet, causing accidental fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command Confusion] Can an operator accidentally run CreateAccounts when intending EmitTx due to similar argument structures, causing unintended account creation and fund drainage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Timeout Precision] Is the deadline check at diag.rs:70 precise enough to catch timeouts, or can clock skew cause transactions to be considered expired when they're still valid? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Coin Source Account Rotation] If the coin source account is compromised, is there a rotation mechanism, or does compromise mean permanent loss of all testing infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - PingEndPoints branch] [False Success] Does PingEndPoints returning Ok(()) without actual pinging create a false sense of security that could lead to deploying against unreachable clusters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Instance Iteration Order] Does the order of instance iteration at diag.rs:26,53 matter for security, or can attackers exploit predictable ordering to time attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [Transaction Mix Validation] Does args_to_transaction_mix_per_phase() validate that transaction types are compatible with the target network version, or can incompatible transactions cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Message Sanitization] Do error messages from panic! calls contain sensitive data like private keys, API tokens, or validator IPs that should be redacted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Concurrent Modification] If cluster configuration changes during diag() execution (e.g., validators added/removed), can this cause inconsistent health check results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Cross-Module] [TPS Miscalculation] If stats.rate() calculation at line 92 uses wall-clock time without accounting for clock adjustments (NTP, DST), can this produce misleading TPS metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Host Extraction] Does api_url().host().unwrap() at diag.rs:57 properly handle IPv6 addresses, or can parsing errors cause panics? (Low)"
