  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::toeplitz_for_poly()] [Zero padding length] The function pads with vec![F::zero(); f.len()-2] - can f.len() < 2 cause integer underflow in the subtraction, leading to either panic or massive memory allocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::toeplitz_for_poly()] [Debug assertion] The debug_assert_eq! only runs in debug mode - can production builds have incorrect Toeplitz lengths that violate the expected dimension relationship, causing subtle proof generation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::toeplitz_for_poly()] [Polynomial degree mismatch] If the polynomial f has degree higher than toeplitz_domain.dimension(), does this function detect it and fail, or does it silently truncate/pad leading to incorrect proof generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::compute_h_term_commitments()] [Round index bounds] The function accesses prepared_toeplitz_inputs[round] - can an out-of-bounds round index cause a panic during proof generation, or is there proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::compute_h_term_commitments()] [Polynomial extension] The function clones f and extends it with zeros - can the extension logic create a polynomial of incorrect length that violates the debug_assert_eq!, causing production builds to have silent failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::compute_h_term_commitments()] [Zero padding count] The repeat_n calculation uses toeplitz_domain.dimension() + 1 - f.len() - can negative results cause integer underflow or excessive zero padding? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::compute_h_term_commitments()] [Degree assertion] The debug assertion checks self.toeplitz_domain.dimension() == f.len() - 1 - if f.len() == 0, can this cause integer underflow in the subtraction?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::eval_proofs_at_roots_of_unity()] [H-term validation] The function directly uses h_term_commitments from compute_h_term_commitments() - if these are incorrect due to earlier bugs, will the FFT amplify the errors or mask them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::eval_proofs_at_roots_of_unity()] [Round parameter] Is the round parameter properly validated, or can an invalid round index cause panics or incorrect proof generation when accessing prepared_toeplitz_inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/algebra/fk_algorithm.rs] [Function: FKDomain::eval_proofs_at_roots_of_unity()] [FFT correctness] Does the FFT operation on h_term_commitments guarantee cryptographically sound proof generation, or can numerical errors in FFT lead to proofs that fail verification?
