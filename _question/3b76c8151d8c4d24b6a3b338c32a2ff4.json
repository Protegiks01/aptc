  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Default Chain Collision] Can multiple test networks using ChainId::default() cause transaction replay across different test instances if transactions are not properly isolated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Module Level] [Production Usage] Could this dummy network code be accidentally imported and used in production builds, exposing production validators to test-only security configurations and weak key generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: dummy_network_config()] [Test Protocol Exposure] Can TEST_RPC_PROTOCOL and TEST_DIRECT_SEND_PROTOCOL leak into production network configurations, allowing attackers to send test messages that bypass security validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Weak Test Keys] If test-generated keys with TEST_SEED are used in production, can attackers pre-compute all possible validator keys and launch widespread validator impersonation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Module Level] [Conditional Compilation] Are there proper #[cfg(test)] gates preventing this dummy code from being compiled into production binaries, or can it be accidentally included? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Test Configuration Leak] Can test-specific configurations like small channel sizes or weak authentication modes leak into production through misconfigured build flags? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Role Escalation] Can a peer with non-Validator role in the seed set upgrade to PeerRole::Validator during connection, bypassing validator authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Role Validation] Does the assertion checking metadata.role == PeerRole::Validator properly enforce validator-only connections, or can it be bypassed through metadata manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Permission Checks] Are there additional permission checks beyond role verification, or can any peer with Validator role access all consensus operations regardless of stake or governance approval? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [RoleType vs PeerRole] Can confusion between RoleType::Validator (line 73) and PeerRole::Validator (line 96) lead to authorization bypasses where non-validator nodes gain validator privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Role Persistence] Is peer role properly persisted across connections, or can a malicious peer change roles between disconnection and reconnection to bypass role-based restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Time Manipulation] Does TimeService::real() prevent time manipulation attacks, or can an attacker control system time to bypass timeout checks and consensus timing constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Clock Skew] Can significant clock skew between dialer and listener peers cause connection failures, timeout mismatches, or consensus disagreements on block timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Time Service Sharing] Is the same TimeService instance shared across both networks, and could time-based attacks on one network affect the other causing correlated failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Builder Reuse] Can NetworkBuilder instances be reused after build() is called, potentially creating networks with stale or inconsistent configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Build Failure] What happens if network_builder.build().start() fails silently, leaving the network in a partially initialized state where some validators can connect but others cannot? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Configuration Mutation] Can the seeds or other configuration be mutated after being passed to NetworkBuilder but before build() completes, causing TOCTOU vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Multiple Build Calls] Can calling build() multiple times on the same NetworkBuilder create duplicate network instances that interfere with each other causing message duplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Metadata Poisoning] Can malicious peers inject false metadata into PeersAndMetadata causing other peers to make incorrect routing or trust decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Metadata Staleness] Is peer metadata properly updated when peers disconnect and reconnect, or can stale metadata cause messages to be routed to disconnected peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Concurrent Metadata Access] Can concurrent reads and writes to peers_and_metadata lead to race conditions or inconsistent views of peer state across different threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Metadata Overflow] Is there a limit on the number of peers tracked in PeersAndMetadata, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by registering unlimited peers? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Parse Unwrap] Can NetworkAddress::parse().unwrap() panic on malformed addresses, and could this be exploited if address strings come from external configuration files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Connection Event Unwrap] Does block_on(connection_events.recv()).unwrap() properly handle channel closure, or can it panic if the sender is dropped prematurely causing validator crash? (High)"
