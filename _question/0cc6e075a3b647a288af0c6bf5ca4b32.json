  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Message type confusion] Can a malicious peer send a PeerMonitoringServiceMessage::Request instead of a Response, causing the client to treat a request as a response and potentially leak internal state or trigger unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Response validation] Does the match statement on lines 50-59 properly validate that the response type matches the request type sent, or can a malicious peer respond to a GetNetworkInformation request with a LatencyPing response causing type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Error response handling] When receiving PeerMonitoringServiceMessage::Response(Err(err)) on line 52, does the client validate the error type, or can a malicious peer inject crafted error messages to trigger panic conditions or information leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Request echoing attack] On lines 55-58, when receiving a Request instead of Response, does the error message expose sensitive request details in logs that could leak validator state or network topology information to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Timeout manipulation] Can an attacker specify an extremely large timeout value in the Duration parameter on line 39, causing the client to hang indefinitely and exhaust connection resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Timeout overflow] On line 97, when converting request_timeout_ms (u64) to Duration::from_millis(), can an attacker pass u64::MAX causing integer overflow or extremely long timeouts that exhaust system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Zero timeout DoS] Can an attacker pass request_timeout_ms=0 on line 76, causing immediate timeout failures that disrupt peer monitoring and prevent legitimate latency measurements? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Concurrent request flooding] Does the send_to_peer_rpc call on lines 43-47 have rate limiting, or can an attacker flood a peer with concurrent requests causing resource exhaustion on both client and server sides? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Peer ID validation] On line 46, when sending to recipient PeerNetworkId, is there validation that this peer is actually connected and authorized, or can an attacker specify arbitrary peer IDs to probe network topology? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Peer dereference] On line 95, the peer_network_id is dereferenced (*peer_network_id) - can this cause issues if the PeerNetworkId is invalid or if there are race conditions with peer disconnection? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Peer identity confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the PeerNetworkId on line 73 to send requests to system peers or validators that should not be monitored, potentially causing privilege escalation or unauthorized network access? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request ID manipulation] Is the request_id parameter on line 74 validated to be unique and monotonically increasing, or can an attacker reuse request IDs to cause metric corruption or replay attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request ID overflow] Can the request_id (u64) on line 74 overflow after long-running nodes, causing ID collisions that corrupt metrics or enable request/response mismatching? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request clone vulnerability] On line 96, the request is cloned - if the request contains interior mutability (RefCell, Mutex), can concurrent modifications during clone cause race conditions or inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Double clone overhead] The request is cloned twice (lines 96 and 111) - can an attacker send large LatencyPingRequest structures to cause excessive memory allocation and DoS through clone overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request mutation after send] After cloning request on line 96 for sending, is the original request object on line 81 immutable, or can race conditions between lines 93-98 and error handling on line 111 cause inconsistent logging? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Error conversion] On line 49, network errors are converted to Error::NetworkError with to_string() - does this expose sensitive internal network state, peer addresses, or connection details that could aid reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Error logging verbosity] On lines 117-124, errors are logged with full error details - can malicious peers trigger specific error conditions to inject false information into monitoring logs or cause log spam DoS?

  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Error propagation] Does the error handling on lines 116-131 properly sanitize error messages before propagating them up the call stack, or can sensitive peer information leak through error chains? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Metrics counter manipulation] On lines 86-90, request counters are incremented before validation - can an attacker send invalid requests to artificially inflate SENT_REQUESTS metrics and mask real attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Metrics label injection] On line 88, request.get_label() is used directly in metrics - can a malicious request type with crafted label strings cause metrics database corruption or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Success metrics timing] SUCCESS_RESPONSES metrics are incremented on lines 109-113 before returning response - can an attacker cause partial failures after metric increment but before response processing, creating false success signals? (Low)",
