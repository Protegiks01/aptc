  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Checkpoint consistency] Can checkpointing mechanisms cause get_usage() to return values from different checkpoint versions across validators, breaking determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Pruning impact] If storage is pruned between blocks, can native_get_usage return different values before and after pruning for the same logical state, causing non-determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Error recovery] If resolver.get_usage() fails intermittently due to storage backend issues, does the system retry or permanently fail, and can adversaries exploit this? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Partial failure] Can storage systems return partial results (e.g., items count succeeds but bytes count fails), causing incomplete Usage structs to be created? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Cascading failures] If native_get_usage fails in the first transaction of an epoch, can this cascade to prevent the entire epoch from starting, causing total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Struct: NativeStateStorageContext] [StateKey constraint] The StateStorageView<Key = StateKey> constraint at line 23 - can adversaries provide resolvers with different Key types that satisfy trait bounds but cause type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Return type safety] Does SmallVec<[Value; 1]> guarantee exactly one element is returned, or can it return 0 or 2+ elements causing Move VM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Value semantics] Can the Value::struct_ and Struct::pack operations at lines 68-71 create values that violate Move's linear type semantics when returned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Storage backend bypass] Can adversaries provide a custom StateStorageView implementation that bypasses storage backend security checks, allowing unauthorized data access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Shard inconsistency] In sharded storage systems, can get_usage() aggregate counts from inconsistent shard states, causing non-deterministic total counts? (High)",
