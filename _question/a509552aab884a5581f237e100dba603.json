  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Migration Failure] When max_total_wal_size is changed, does RocksDB gracefully adapt, or can this cause WAL compaction failures that corrupt the database during the transition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Loss] If a validator switches from readonly=false to readonly=true and back, can uncommitted writes be lost or state transitions be inconsistent with the rest of the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Downgrade Risk] If stats_level is changed from All to None during a network upgrade, can the removal of statistics cause RocksDB to deallocate buffers that are still in use, leading to crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: convert_stats_level()] [Completeness] Does the match statement handle all possible RocksDBStatsLevel enum variants, or can new variants added to aptos-config cause panics due to non-exhaustive pattern matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: convert_stats_level()] [Type Safety] Are the RocksDBStatsLevel and rocksdb::StatsLevel enums guaranteed to have compatible semantics, or can mismatched meanings cause incorrect statistics collection that affects performance tuning decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: convert_stats_level()] [Default Value] If an invalid or uninitialized RocksDBStatsLevel value is passed (through unsafe code or serialization bugs), can this cause undefined behavior in the match statement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: convert_stats_level()] [Version Compatibility] If the rocksdb crate version is upgraded and adds new StatsLevel variants, can the current conversion logic cause compilation errors or runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Race Condition] If gen_rocksdb_options() is called concurrently with the same config object from multiple threads, can race conditions in Options mutation cause non-deterministic database configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Data Race] If the RocksdbConfig object is modified by another thread while gen_rocksdb_options() is reading its fields, can this cause torn reads or inconsistent option combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Memory Safety] Are all calls to db_opts methods (set_max_open_files, set_env, etc.) safe in concurrent contexts, or can they trigger data races in RocksDB's internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Shared State] If multiple database instances created with these options share resources (like the Env), can concurrent operations on different databases cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Negative Values] If config.max_open_files is assigned a negative value through integer underflow in upstream code, will RocksDB reject it or interpret it as a very large positive value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Zero Values] If both config.max_open_files and config.max_total_wal_size are set to 0, can RocksDB enter a deadlock state where it cannot open files or write to WAL? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Boundary Values] Are there minimum/maximum safe values for max_open_files and max_total_wal_size that should be enforced? Can values outside these ranges cause RocksDB internal errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Option Conflicts] Can certain combinations of options (e.g., readonly=true with create_if_missing=true) create contradictory states that RocksDB cannot handle? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Type Coercion] When config.max_open_files (likely i32) is passed to set_max_open_files, can integer type conversions cause value truncation or sign extension bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Silent Failures] Do any of the db_opts setter methods (set_max_open_files, set_env, etc.) return errors that are being ignored, potentially causing the database to open with unsafe default settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Environment Validation] If set_env() is called with an invalid or corrupted Env object, does it validate the environment or silently use a broken configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Statistics Errors] Can enable_statistics() or set_statistics_level() fail under any circumstances? If so, are errors handled or ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Panic Risk] Are there any code paths in the Options API that can panic (e.g., due to assertions in C++ RocksDB code), and if so, can they be triggered by malicious configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Atomicity] If the function is interrupted (e.g., by panic or system signal) after some options are set but before others, can a partially configured Options object be used to open a database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Default Values] What are the default values for options not explicitly set in this function, and can they vary across RocksDB versions or platforms, causing non-deterministic behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Immutability] After Options is created and returned, can it be further modified before opening the database, and if so, can this violate assumptions about the configured options? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Configuration Drift] If config object is reused across multiple gen_rocksdb_options() calls, can modifications to config between calls cause different database instances to have incompatible configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Memory Overhead] Does enabling statistics with StatsLevel::All cause significant memory allocation that could trigger OOM on resource-constrained validators? (Medium)"
