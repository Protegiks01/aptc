(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Static: DISPATCHABLE_NATIVES] [Type Confusion] Does the dispatchable native mechanism properly validate type arguments during dynamic dispatch, or can an attacker craft type parameters that cause type confusion when dispatching to fungible asset or account abstraction functions?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Static: DISPATCHABLE_NATIVES] [State Inconsistency] Can concurrent calls to dispatchable_withdraw and dispatchable_deposit create race conditions that lead to double-spending or incorrect balance calculations across validators?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Code Injection] Is the code field properly validated to prevent injection of malicious bytecode instructions that could bypass gas metering or access control checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Native Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the dual native/is_native flags to create a function that appears non-native but has a native implementation, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Visibility Bypass] Can the visibility field be tampered with after loading to escalate a private function to public, allowing unauthorized cross-module calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Entry Point Exploitation] Can the is_entry flag be manipulated to mark privileged internal functions as entry points, exposing them to direct transaction invocation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Type Confusion] Do return_tys and param_tys properly validate against signature bounds, or can mismatched types cause type confusion during function calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Gas Exploit] Can local_tys be manipulated to report fewer locals than actually used, causing under-charging of gas and potential DoS through resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Access Control] Does access_specifier properly enforce Move 2.0 access control, or can it be bypassed through type parameter substitution or reflection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Persistence Violation] Can the is_persistent flag be circumvented to allow non-persistent closures to be stored, potentially causing state corruption on deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/loader/function.rs] [Struct: Function] [Reentrancy] Does has_module_reentrancy_lock properly prevent recursive module calls, or can it be bypassed through indirect call chains or native functions? (High)",
