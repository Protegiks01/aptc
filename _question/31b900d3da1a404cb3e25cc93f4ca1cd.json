  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: PROOF_QUEUE_REMAINING_TXNS_DURATION] [Lines: 126-134] [Calculation Performance] Can an attacker craft proof queue states that make remaining_txns calculation extremely slow, causing suspicious PROOF_QUEUE_REMAINING_TXNS_DURATION spikes? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: BATCH_GENERATOR_MAIN_LOOP] [Lines: 137-145] [Loop Performance] Can Byzantine batch generators intentionally slow their event loop to inflate BATCH_GENERATOR_MAIN_LOOP duration and disrupt consensus throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: BATCH_CREATION_DURATION] [Lines: 891-900] [Creation Timing] Can attackers analyze BATCH_CREATION_DURATION patterns to determine optimal timing for batch injection attacks that bypass quota limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: EMPTY_BATCH_CREATION_DURATION] [Lines: 903-912] [Empty Batch Timing] Does recording separate empty batch creation duration reveal implementation details that could be exploited to optimize Byzantine empty batch spam? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: BATCH_CREATION_COMPUTE_LATENCY] [Lines: 924-932] [Computation Timing] Can malicious transaction payloads cause extremely long batch computation times, generating anomalous BATCH_CREATION_COMPUTE_LATENCY that disrupts monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: BATCH_CREATION_PERSIST_LATENCY] [Lines: 935-943] [Persistence Timing] Can attackers trigger DB performance issues that cause high BATCH_CREATION_PERSIST_LATENCY, forcing validators to appear slow and potentially getting slashed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: BATCH_TO_POS_DURATION] [Lines: 946-955] [Proof Creation Timing] Does recording precise batch-to-PoS duration leak information about validator performance that could be used to target slower validators? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/counters.rs] [Metric: SIGNED_BATCH_INFO_VERIFY_DURATION] [Lines: 957-965] [Verification Timing] Can attackers craft batch signatures that take variable time to verify, creating timing side-channels in SIGNED_BATCH_INFO_VERIFY_DURATION? (Medium)",
