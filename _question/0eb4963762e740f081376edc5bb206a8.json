  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Module: framing] [API exposure] Does exposing the 'framing' module as public create an unnecessarily large attack surface for the Aptos network layer, potentially allowing external crates to bypass intended network protocol abstractions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Module: transport] [API exposure] Does exposing the 'transport' module as public allow untrusted code to construct custom transports that could bypass network security validations in the Aptos P2P layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Architecture] [API design] Should any of the public modules (framing, transport) be marked as pub(crate) or have restricted visibility to prevent misuse by downstream consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply chain] Are the dependencies declared in Cargo.toml for this crate (bytes, futures, tokio, url) properly audited for supply chain vulnerabilities that could affect the exposed modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Module: framing] [Dependency exposure] Does the public framing module transitively expose unsafe dependencies or types that could be exploited by malicious crates in the Aptos ecosystem? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Module: transport] [Dependency exposure] Does the public transport module expose network primitives that could be used to construct malicious peer connections bypassing validator authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Security clarity] Does the lack of security documentation in the module comments create confusion about the intended trust boundaries and security properties of the exposed APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/lib.rs] [Feature flags] [Configuration] Could the 'fuzzing' and 'testing' features defined in Cargo.toml accidentally be enabled in production builds, exposing debug functionality? (Low)"
