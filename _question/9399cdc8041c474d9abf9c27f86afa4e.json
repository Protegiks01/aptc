  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can an attacker initialize FileStoreUploader with a manipulated chain_id parameter that doesn't match the actual blockchain, causing transaction data from different chains to be mixed in the same file store and corrupting indexer state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Metadata Injection] When initializing an uninitialized file store (lines 47-63), can an attacker who gains write access inject malicious FileStoreMetadata with crafted num_transactions_per_folder or version values to break recovery logic or cause data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization Race Condition] If multiple FileStoreUploader instances call new() concurrently for the same uninitialized file store (line 47 check), can they both pass the is_initialized check and create conflicting metadata files, leading to data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on Metadata Mismatch] The assertion at lines 68-75 panics if NUM_TXNS_PER_FOLDER doesn't match stored metadata, but can an attacker who corrupted the metadata file cause all indexer nodes to panic on startup, creating a denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Unchecked Metadata Deserialization] When reading file store metadata during initialization (lines 69-72), are there any checks to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities if the metadata JSON is malformed or contains unexpected fields that could cause panics or incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Default Version Initialization] The metadata is initialized with version: 0 (line 56), but can this cause issues if the actual blockchain has progressed significantly, leading to attempts to index transactions that don't exist or skipping critical early transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Serialization Panic] The serde_json::to_vec call at line 58 uses unwrap(), which could panic if serialization fails - can an attacker cause memory corruption or other state that makes FileStoreMetadata non-serializable, causing initialization to panic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: new()] [Save Failure Panic] The unwrap_or_else panic at line 62 will crash the entire process if metadata file save fails - can an attacker cause storage backend errors (full disk, permissions, network issues) to DoS the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Version Rollback Attack] In the recovery process (lines 90-94), get_latest_version is called and assumed to exist with expect() - can an attacker delete or corrupt the metadata file to cause a panic, or worse, manipulate the latest version to roll back to an earlier state and cause transaction re-processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Infinite Recovery Loop] The recovery while loop (lines 98-111) checks batch metadata up to MAX_NUM_FOLDERS_TO_CHECK_FOR_RECOVERY (5 folders), but what if corrupted batch metadata causes version to never increment, creating an infinite loop that hangs the recovery process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Batch Metadata Corruption] At line 99, batch_metadata.files.last().unwrap() is called without checking if files vector is empty - can corrupted or maliciously crafted batch metadata with empty files vector cause a panic during recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Version Consistency Attack] The recovery logic updates version from batch_last_version (line 100) and checks if version % NUM_TXNS_PER_FOLDER != 0 (line 101) - can an attacker manipulate batch metadata to have last_version values that skip over important version ranges, causing transaction gaps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Recovery Panic on Corruption] The panic at lines 107-109 triggers if file store metadata is far behind batch metadata, but this assumes corruption rather than legitimate delay - can this cause false positive panics during normal operation under high load or storage lag? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Metadata Update Race] After recovery, update_file_store_metadata is called at line 113 - can concurrent recovery processes or uploads cause race conditions where the metadata version is updated inconsistently, leading to transaction duplication or loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Batch Metadata Manipulation] If an attacker can write to file storage, can they inject fake batch metadata files that cause recovery to restore an incorrect buffered_batch_metadata_to_recover state (line 102), leading to data corruption when upload resumes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Version Integer Overflow] The version variable is u64 and gets updated from batch_last_version (line 100) - can extremely large version numbers cause integer overflow in subsequent operations like modulo arithmetic (line 101) or addition operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: recover()] [Recovery State Inconsistency] The function returns both recovered version and buffered_batch_metadata (line 117) - if these are inconsistent (e.g., batch metadata references different version ranges), can this cause the FileStoreOperatorV2 to be initialized in an invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Channel Capacity DoS] The channel created at line 137 has a capacity of 5 - can an attacker slow down the upload task to fill the channel buffer, causing the main loop to block when sending to tx.clone() (line 168), effectively halting transaction indexing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Oneshot Channel Panic] The recover_tx.send(()) at line 134 uses expect() which will panic if the receiver is dropped - can timing issues or task cancellation cause the receiver to be dropped prematurely, causing a panic during startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Unbounded Loop DoS] The main processing loop (lines 148-176) runs indefinitely without any cancellation mechanism - if transactions stop arriving (len == 0 at line 172), it only sleeps for 200ms before retrying - can this waste resources or prevent graceful shutdown? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Upload Task Panic Propagation] The upload task (lines 138-145) calls do_upload().await.unwrap() which will panic the task if upload fails - does this panic get propagated properly or can it silently fail, causing transactions to be lost without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Buffer Task Panic Propagation] Similarly, the main loop calls buffer_and_maybe_dump_transactions_to_file().await.unwrap() at line 170 - can failures in buffering cause silent panics that stop transaction processing without proper error reporting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/file_store_uploader.rs] [Function: start()] [Transaction Ordering Attack] The loop gets transactions from cache at line 157-163 and processes them one by one (lines 166-170) - can an attacker manipulate the DataManager cache to return transactions out of order, causing version gaps or overlaps? (Critical)",

(High)",
