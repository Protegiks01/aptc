  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run() - Oneoff::Transaction] [Sequence Number Bypass] Does NoVerify skip sequence number validation, allowing restoration of transaction history with gaps or duplicates that violate replay protection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run() - Oneoff::Transaction] [Move VM Bypass] Can an attacker restore transactions containing invalid Move bytecode that would normally be rejected by the VM, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution when these transactions are later referenced? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
