  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: new_from_db()] [Initialization failure] If get_pre_committed_ledger_summary() returns stale or corrupted data from disk, does initialization silently accept invalid state that causes all subsequent commits to be invalid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_committed()] [Stuck queue] If dequeue_committed() fails the ensure() checks but the chunk was already committed to disk, does the queue get stuck with the same chunk at the front, preventing all future commits and causing liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [Rollback failure] If enqueue_for_ledger_update() updates latest_state but then returns error before pushing to queue, is latest_state left in advanced state without corresponding chunk, breaking version sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Clone panic] Can cloning state_summary or transaction_accumulator fail due to memory allocation errors, leaving the chunk partially processed in an unrecoverable state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: expecting_version()] [Version overflow] Can latest_state.next_version() overflow u64 limits after many transactions, causing version wraparound that enables replay of old transactions with same version numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [Out-of-order enqueue] Does enqueue_for_ledger_update() validate that chunk_to_update_ledger.output.result_state() has version equal to expecting_version(), or can chunks be enqueued out-of-order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Version jump] Can save_ledger_update_output() accept ExecutedChunk with non-sequential version relative to current latest_state_summary, creating version gaps in the committed ledger? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Multi-queue version mismatch] Can versions in to_update_ledger chunks diverge from versions in to_commit chunks due to improper state tracking across the two queues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_commit()] [Commit order violation] Can chunks in to_commit queue be committed in different order than they were executed, causing transaction ordering violations and breaking deterministic execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Accumulator mismatch] If transaction_accumulator from ExecutedChunk doesn't properly extend the previous latest_txn_accumulator, can this create forked accumulator histories that validators disagree on? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_update_ledger()] [Stale accumulator] Can next_chunk_to_update_ledger() return stale latest_txn_accumulator if save_ledger_update_output() updated it for previous chunk but this function clones old value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Accumulator-state version gap] Since latest_txn_accumulator is updated in save_ledger_update_output() but latest_state is updated earlier in enqueue_for_ledger_update(), can accumulator trail behind state by multiple chunks creating verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: new_from_db()] [Accumulator initialization] If transaction_accumulator loaded from database is corrupted or truncated, does initialization detect this and fail safely, or proceed with invalid accumulator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [InMemoryTransactionAccumulator leak] Can repeated Arc::clone() of transaction_accumulator cause memory leaks if old accumulators are never freed, eventually exhausting validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [Unbounded queue growth] Can malicious or Byzantine validators continuously enqueue chunks without calling save_ledger_update_output(), causing to_update_ledger to grow unbounded and exhaust memory?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Commit queue stall] Can to_commit queue grow unbounded if save_ledger_update_output() is called but dequeue_committed() is never called, causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Memory amplification] Since VecDeque contains Option<T> wrappers, does the None values after take() operations waste significant memory if queues grow large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [Large chunk DoS] Can attackers enqueue chunks with extremely large PartialStateComputeResult (many state updates), causing memory exhaustion when cloned and stored in queue? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: new_from_db()] [Initialization DoS] Can database contain so many pre-committed chunks that get_pre_committed_ledger_summary() takes excessive time or memory, delaying validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Queue leak detection] If is_empty() is never checked and queues continuously grow, is there monitoring or alerting to detect stuck pipeline before memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
