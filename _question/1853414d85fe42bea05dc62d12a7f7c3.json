  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Struct: TransactionBuilder] [Incomplete builder] Can an attacker call build() on a partially initialized TransactionBuilder where optional fields like sender or sequence_number are missing, causing panics via expect() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Struct: TransactionBuilder] [Builder reuse] If a TransactionBuilder instance is reused after build(), can stale state from previous transactions leak into new transactions, potentially causing signature mismatches or transaction confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Move semantics] The build() function consumes self - but are there any Clone implementations that could allow an attacker to clone a builder and create multiple transactions with the same parameters but different signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas calculation overflow] When computing total gas cost (max_gas_amount * gas_unit_price), can the multiplication overflow u64 if both values are large, causing transactions to appear cheaper than they actually are? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: expiration_timestamp()] [Addition overflow] The calculation 'as_secs() + expiration_duration' can overflow if current time is near u64::MAX - can this cause transaction expiration times to wrap around, creating transactions that expire in the past? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Struct: TransactionExpiration] [Negative relative time] If expiration_duration is treated as signed somewhere in the codebase, can an attacker set negative durations to create transactions that expired in the past but still validate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: upgrade_payload_with_rng()] [Flag inconsistency] Can an attacker set use_txn_payload_v2_format=true but use_orderless_transactions=false (or vice versa) to create transactions that behave inconsistently across validator nodes with different configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: transaction_builder()] [Payload upgrade side effects] The payload upgrade with upgrade_payload_with_fn may modify the payload in unexpected ways - can an attacker exploit this to bypass payload validation that happens before the upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Nonce/sequence confusion] When has_nonce() is true, sequence_number is set to u64::MAX unconditionally - can this create confusion in systems that expect specific sequence number semantics, potentially enabling replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Enum: TransactionExpiration] [Variant confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the TransactionExpiration enum to switch between Relative and Absolute modes after initialization, potentially bypassing expiration validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: payload()] [Payload type validation] Does the payload() function validate that the TransactionPayload is well-formed? Can an attacker provide corrupted or malformed payloads that cause deserialization errors during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: entry_function()] [EntryFunction validation] Can an attacker provide EntryFunction with invalid type arguments or argument counts that bypass transaction validation but fail during execution, wasting gas or causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_user_account()] [Key derivation] The AuthenticationKey::ed25519(public_key) derivation process - can an attacker exploit weaknesses in the key-to-address derivation to create vanity addresses that collide with existing accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_transaction_with_payload_hash()] [Hash preimage attack] While SHA3-256 is secure, can an attacker leverage any implementation flaws in HashValue::sha3_256_of() to create hash collisions or preimage attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Struct: TransactionFactory] [Concurrent access] If TransactionFactory is shared across threads without proper synchronization, can race conditions in use_txn_payload_v2_format or use_replay_protection_nonce flags cause non-deterministic transaction construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: transaction_builder()] [RNG state race] The thread_rng() call for nonce generation - can concurrent calls lead to nonce reuse if the RNG state isn't properly isolated, enabling replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_transaction()] [Unbounded payload] The payload parameter is Vec<u8> with no size limit - can an attacker provide extremely large payloads that cause memory exhaustion, crashing validators or causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_account()] [Vector size attack] The additional_owners parameter is Vec<AccountAddress> - can an attacker provide millions of owners to cause memory exhaustion or extremely slow validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Struct: TransactionFactory] [Feature flag manipulation] The use_txn_payload_v2_format and use_replay_protection_nonce flags - if these can be changed after factory creation, can an attacker toggle them to create inconsistent transaction formats? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: upgrade_payload_with_rng()] [Version downgrade attack] Can an attacker use upgrade_payload_with_rng with use_txn_payload_v2_format=false to downgrade a v2 payload to v1, potentially bypassing v2-specific security features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: entry_function()] [Move module loading] When creating EntryFunction payloads, can an attacker reference non-existent or malicious Move modules that exploit VM loading vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: script()] [Move bytecode validation] Does the Script payload undergo proper Move bytecode verification before execution? Can an attacker inject invalid opcodes or type violations that crash the VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas price manipulation] The gas_unit_price uses std::cmp::max(GAS_UNIT_PRICE, 1) to enforce minimum price - but can an attacker set gas_unit_price to 1 and max_gas_amount to u64::MAX to create transactions that pay almost nothing but consume maximum resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: with_transaction_expiration_time()] [Expiration gaming] Can an attacker set extremely long expiration times (e.g., 1 year) to keep transactions in the mempool indefinitely, potentially causing mempool bloat or preventing garbage collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Transaction invariants] Does build() enforce all required transaction invariants (non-zero gas, valid expiration, proper sequence number)? Can an attacker create transactions that violate protocol rules? (High)"
