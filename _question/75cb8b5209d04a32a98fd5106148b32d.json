  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Rust: Thread pool safety] Does the Arc-wrapped executor_thread_pool properly synchronize access, or could race conditions in thread pool internals cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Rust: Panic handling] If parallel execution panics in a worker thread, does the test properly catch and report it, or could panics be silently swallowed hiding critical bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Rust: Memory safety] Are all clone operations on key_universe and transactions deep copies, or could shared mutable state cause memory safety violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Rust: Integer arithmetic] Are there potential integer overflows in universe_size - 3, transaction_count multiplications, or num_executions loops that could cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Rust: Unwrap/expect] Does the code use unwrap() or expect() that could panic on unexpected inputs, and are these error cases properly tested? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Integration: Real transaction patterns] Do generated transactions match real-world usage patterns, or could production see transaction sequences that tests never exercise? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Integration: Validator behavior] Do tests simulate Byzantine validator behavior like attempting to execute invalid transactions or manipulating execution results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Integration: Network conditions] Could network delays, message reordering, or partial failures during parallel execution cause issues not covered by these local tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Integration: State store interaction] Do tests verify correct interaction with NonEmptyGroupDataView state reads, or could production state store bugs cause incorrect execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Integration: Gas price changes] Could gas price updates between test setup and execution cause gas limit checks to behave differently than expected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [System: Performance degradation] Could specific transaction patterns cause parallel executor performance to degrade catastrophically, enabling DoS attacks on the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [System: Resource leaks] Do tests verify that all resources are properly released after execution, or could production suffer from memory/thread leaks over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [System: Deadlock potential] Could certain transaction patterns cause deadlock in the parallel executor, and do tests include deadlock detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Test infra: BaselineOutput correctness] Is the BaselineOutput implementation itself correct, or could bugs in baseline generation cause it to accept incorrect parallel execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Test infra: Assertion completeness] Do assert_parallel_output and assert_output check all aspects of execution (reads, writes, deltas, events, gas), or could some be ignored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Test infra: Mock accuracy] Do MockTransaction and MockTask accurately model real transaction behavior, or could differences cause tests to miss bugs in production execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Test infra: Proptest shrinking] If proptest finds a failing case, does shrinking produce minimal reproducible examples, or could it hide the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Test infra: Deterministic seeding] Are proptest runs deterministic or do they use random seeds, and could non-deterministic tests hide intermittent bugs? (Medium)",
