  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious path containing '../' sequences that escapes the intended package directory when passed to reroot_path(), potentially accessing or executing prover verification on sensitive system files outside the package boundary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create symbolic links in the package path that cause reroot_path() to resolve to unintended directories, allowing verification of malicious Move code or exfiltration of source code through prover error messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Race Condition] When reroot_path() calls std::env::set_current_dir(), can a concurrent thread or process exploit the TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) window between path validation and directory change to swap the target directory, causing the prover to run on malicious code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker provide a deeply nested or circular directory path that causes reroot_path() to consume excessive resources during canonicalization, leading to CPU exhaustion or stack overflow in the path resolution logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Directory Persistence] Since reroot_path() permanently changes the current working directory via set_current_dir(), can this side effect cause security issues in multi-threaded environments where other threads expect a specific working directory, potentially leading to unintended file operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Configuration Injection] When loading Prover.toml at line 61-64, can an attacker craft a malicious Prover.toml file with injected prover options that override security-critical settings, such as disabling verification checks or enabling unsafe features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Path Traversal in Config] Can an attacker manipulate the Prover.toml path construction at line 61 by providing a rerooted_path containing special characters or path traversal sequences that cause the config file to be loaded from an unintended location? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Symlink Confusion] If Prover.toml is a symbolic link to a malicious configuration file outside the package directory, will the exists() check at line 62 follow the symlink and load untrusted configuration, bypassing intended security boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Config Override Attack] Since Prover.toml options are added before user-provided opts at line 65, can an attacker place a malicious Prover.toml in the package that sets dangerous defaults which users may not realize are being applied, leading to incomplete verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Unicode Normalization] Can an attacker use Unicode normalization vulnerabilities in the Prover.toml path construction to create files with visually similar but different names, causing the wrong configuration file to be loaded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Command Injection] When prover options are extracted at lines 56-59 and passed to Options::create_from_args() at line 66, can an attacker inject shell metacharacters or command separators that lead to arbitrary command execution in the underlying prover process? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Option Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious ProverOptions::Options containing specially formatted strings that override critical security settings when passed to the prover, such as '--unsafe-mode' or options that disable verification checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Args Array Injection] When building the args vector starting at line 60 with 'package' string, can an attacker exploit the vector concatenation at line 65 to inject arbitrary arguments that modify prover behavior, such as changing output paths or enabling debug modes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Format String Attack] Can the format!() macro at line 63 be exploited if prover_toml.to_string_lossy() contains format string specifiers, leading to information disclosure or unexpected behavior in the configuration string? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Vector Capacity DoS] Can an attacker provide extremely large ProverOptions::Options vectors that cause memory exhaustion during the opts.iter().cloned() operation at line 65, leading to denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Information Disclosure] When options.setup_logging() is called at line 70, can verbose logging expose sensitive information about the package structure, source code paths, or verification results that could aid an attacker in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Test Mode Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the for_test flag at line 67-71 to bypass production logging and enable test-specific behaviors that weaken security guarantees or expose additional attack surface? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::create()] [Path Injection] When creating a ProverTest with path.into() at line 91, can an attacker provide a path containing null bytes, newlines, or other special characters that cause path_in_crate() to resolve to unintended locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::with_options()] [Options Injection] Can the options vector populated at lines 98-100 be exploited to inject malicious prover arguments that bypass verification checks or enable unsafe features during test execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::with_local_only()] [CI Detection Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the ENV_TEST_ON_CI environment variable to bypass the local_only check at line 117-119, forcing security-sensitive tests to run in CI environments where they shouldn't execute? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Directory Persistence Attack] When the current directory is saved at line 124 and restored at line 135, can a malicious test exploit this side effect to manipulate the working directory of other concurrent tests, causing them to operate on wrong files or directories?

(Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Error Propagation] The unwrap() at line 136 will panic on prover errors - can an attacker craft Move code that triggers specific prover errors causing test harness crashes and preventing detection of other security vulnerabilities?
