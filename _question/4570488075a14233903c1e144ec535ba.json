  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Message Ordering] Since CrossShardMsg has no sequence number or timestamp, can messages arrive out-of-order causing the receiving shard to apply write operations in the wrong sequence, leading to non-deterministic state across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Race Condition] If multiple RemoteTxnWrite messages for dependent transactions arrive concurrently at a shard, is there proper synchronization to ensure they're applied in transaction dependency order, or can race conditions cause incorrect state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Deadlock Scenario] If two shards have circular dependencies and both are waiting for RemoteTxnWrite messages from each other, can this create a deadlock that halts execution indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Message Loss] Is there any acknowledgment mechanism for CrossShardMsg delivery? If messages are lost in transit between shards, can this cause indefinite blocking of the receiving shard waiting for RemoteTxnWrite that never arrives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Double Application] If the same RemoteTxnWrite message is received and processed twice due to retry logic or network duplication, can this cause write operations to be applied multiple times leading to state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Interleaving Attack] Can a Byzantine shard interleave RemoteTxnWriteMsg and StopMsg in a specific pattern that causes some shards to stop processing while others continue, creating state divergence across the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Causal Consistency] Does the messaging protocol ensure causal ordering of RemoteTxnWrite messages (if transaction A depends on B, B's write arrives before A's), or can causal violations cause transactions to read stale data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [No Authentication] CrossShardMsg has no signature or authentication field. Can a malicious network attacker inject fake RemoteTxnWriteMsg messages into the cross-shard communication channel to poison state updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Sender Identity] RemoteTxnWrite doesn't include sender shard identity. Can an attacker impersonate one shard and send writes on behalf of another shard, causing the receiving shard to attribute writes to the wrong source? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Message Replay] Without nonces or message IDs, can an attacker replay old RemoteTxnWriteMsg messages from previous blocks to cause the current block's execution to use stale state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Transaction Context] RemoteTxnWrite doesn't include transaction hash or index. Can this allow an attacker to reuse write operations from one transaction in another transaction's context, bypassing transaction-specific access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Round/Epoch Binding] Messages don't include round_id or epoch information in their structure. Can messages from a previous round be replayed in the current round to cause state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Block Binding] Without block height or hash in RemoteTxnWrite, can an attacker inject writes from a different block into the current block's execution, breaking block-level atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Channel Security] Since message authentication isn't embedded in CrossShardMsg itself, does the transport layer (CrossShardClient) properly authenticate messages, or is there a gap allowing message spoofing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [State Root Divergence] If Byzantine validators send different RemoteTxnWrite messages to different validator nodes for the same state_key, can this cause validators to compute different state roots and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Determinism Violation] Is the processing of CrossShardMsg guaranteed to be deterministic across all validators? Can variations in message arrival timing cause different validators to execute transactions in different orders? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Byzantine Broadcast] If a Byzantine shard leader sends conflicting RemoteTxnWrite messages (different write_op for same state_key) to different validators, can this cause state divergence that leads to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Equivocation Attack] Can a Byzantine validator sign and send contradictory RemoteTxnWrite messages for the same transaction (both None and Some(WriteOp)) to create confusion about whether the transaction committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Liveness Attack] Can a Byzantine shard withhold RemoteTxnWriteMsg messages while sending StopMsg, causing dependent shards to deadlock waiting for writes that never arrive, halting block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [State Fork Attack] By sending carefully timed RemoteTxnWrite messages with conflicting state updates to different validator subsets, can an attacker create temporary state forks that require complex reconciliation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Consensus Delay] Can a Byzantine shard intentionally delay sending RemoteTxnWriteMsg until just before timeout, causing dependent shards to waste computation cycles waiting and degrading overall block execution performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Message Flooding] Can a Byzantine shard send an unlimited stream of RemoteTxnWriteMsg messages (beyond what's needed for actual cross-shard dependencies) to exhaust the receiving shard's message queue or processing capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Memory Amplification] If each RemoteTxnWrite is small but thousands are sent, can the accumulated memory usage in CrossShardStateView's HashMap cause OOM conditions on the receiving validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg::StopMsg] [Stop Message Spam] Can a Byzantine shard send multiple StopMsg messages repeatedly to cause the receiving shard's CrossShardCommitReceiver to thrash (stopping and restarting), degrading performance? (Medium)"
