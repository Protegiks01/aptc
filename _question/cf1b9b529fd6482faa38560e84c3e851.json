  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker provide a malicious AptosVersion with version.major set to u64::MAX, causing integer overflow in the on-chain version::set_for_next_epoch function and potentially corrupting the blockchain version state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Input validation bypass] Does the function validate that version.major is actually greater than the current on-chain version before generating the proposal, or can it create proposals that downgrade the protocol version causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker pass version.major = 0 to reset the blockchain version to zero, potentially disabling all version-gated features and causing network-wide protocol violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Logic error] If version.major equals the current on-chain version, does the function still generate a proposal that will fail on-chain with EINVALID_MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER, wasting governance resources and potentially blocking other critical upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Integer overflow] When version.major is used in the format string at line 32, can extremely large values cause string formatting errors or buffer overflows in the CodeWriter, potentially corrupting the generated Move script? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Code injection] If the AptosVersion struct is deserialized from untrusted input, can an attacker inject malicious Move code through the version.major field (e.g., 'major: 5); malicious_code(); //' ) that gets interpolated into the generated script at line 32? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Code injection] Does the emitln! macro at line 28-33 properly escape or validate the version.major value, or can special characters in version.major break the Move syntax and inject arbitrary code into the governance proposal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Code injection] Can an attacker manipulate the signer_arg value returned by get_signer_arg to inject malicious Move code, since it's directly interpolated into the generated script without validation at lines 30 and 34? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Syntax error] If version.major contains invalid characters or formatting, can it create syntactically invalid Move code that either fails compilation (DoS) or gets misinterpreted by the Move compiler leading to unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Template manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the CodeWriter template system to inject additional statements between version::set_for_next_epoch and aptos_governance::reconfigure, potentially bypassing safety checks or executing unauthorized operations? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash manipulation] Does the function verify the authenticity of the next_execution_hash parameter at line 16, or can an attacker provide a manipulated hash that points to a malicious proposal instead of the intended next step? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Race condition] If multiple version upgrade proposals are generated concurrently with different next_execution_hash values, can race conditions cause hash chain inconsistencies that result in orphaned proposals or execution order violations?
