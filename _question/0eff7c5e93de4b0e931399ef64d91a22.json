  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Negative Sequence Numbers] Although sequence_number is u64, can the deserialize_from_string function be exploited with negative number representations or scientific notation that gets incorrectly parsed into valid u64 values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: Account] [Account Impersonation] Can an attacker craft an Account struct with a valid authentication_key from a high-value account but incorrect sequence_number, potentially causing the REST client to construct transactions that appear to be from the impersonated account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandle] [Counter Overflow] Can the U64 counter field overflow when deserializing very large event counts, potentially causing event sequence tracking to wrap around and break event ordering guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandle] [GUID Collision] Does the EventHandle validate that the guid is unique and properly associated with the counter value, or can attackers craft EventHandles with duplicate GUIDs that cause event collision and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandle] [Counter Manipulation] Can an attacker provide an EventHandle with a manipulated counter value that doesn't match the actual number of events emitted, causing clients to miss critical events or query incorrect event indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandle] [GUID Validation Bypass] Does the EventHandle struct validate that the embedded guid corresponds to an actual on-chain event stream, or can attackers create fake EventHandles that reference non-existent event sources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandleGUID] [Length Mismatch] Can an attacker set len_bytes to a value that doesn't match the actual byte length of the guid field, causing buffer overflows or incorrect memory access when the GUID is processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandleGUID] [Zero-Length Attack] If len_bytes is set to 0, does this create an invalid GUID that could bypass uniqueness checks or cause undefined behavior in GUID comparison operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandleGUID] [Length Overflow] Can len_bytes be set to u8::MAX (255) to indicate an impossibly large GUID that causes memory allocation failures or integer overflow in length calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: EventHandleGUID] [GUID Reuse] Does the EventHandleGUID validate that the combination of len_bytes and guid is unique across all event handles, or can attackers reuse GUIDs to intercept or manipulate events intended for other contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: GUID] [ID Validation] Does the GUID struct validate that the embedded id is well-formed and references a valid creator account, or can attackers create GUIDs with arbitrary IDs that bypass authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: GUID] [Uniqueness Violation] Can multiple GUID instances have identical id values, breaking the global uniqueness guarantee and causing resource conflicts or double-spending vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: GUID] [Serialization Mismatch] Does the GUID maintain consistent representation between serialization and deserialization, or can attackers exploit format discrepancies to create GUIDs that appear different in JSON but identical in binary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: ID] [Creation Number Overflow] Can the U64 creation_num field overflow during GUID generation, potentially causing creation number collisions that break resource uniqueness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: ID] [Address Spoofing] Does the ID struct validate that the addr field corresponds to an actual on-chain account, or can attackers create IDs with arbitrary addresses to impersonate other users' GUIDs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: ID] [Creation Number Reuse] Can an attacker craft an ID with a previously used creation_num and addr combination, potentially enabling resource reuse attacks or breaking Move's resource linear type system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: ID] [Address Zero Attack] Can the addr field be set to address 0x0 (zero address), potentially causing undefined behavior in address validation logic or enabling attacks on system resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Struct: ID] [Creation Number Zero] If creation_num is set to 0, does this represent a valid first GUID or can it be exploited to bypass GUID uniqueness checks by repeatedly using creation_num=0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Cross-struct] [Deserialization Ordering] Can the order of deserialization for nested structs (EventHandle -> EventHandleGUID -> GUID -> ID) be exploited to create partially initialized objects that bypass validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Cross-struct] [Circular References] Can an attacker craft JSON payloads with circular references between Resource data and EventHandle GUIDs that cause infinite loops during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Cross-struct] [Memory Exhaustion] If all structs are deserialized simultaneously for a large API response, can an attacker exhaust available memory by requesting thousands of Resources, Accounts, and EventHandles in a single query? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Cross-struct] [Type Confusion Between Structs] Can an attacker exploit the lack of runtime type checking to pass an EventHandle where a Resource is expected, causing type confusion that leads to incorrect state interpretation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Deserializers] [Malformed JSON] Do the custom deserializers (deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string, deserialize_resource_type) handle malformed JSON gracefully, or can attackers cause panics by providing invalid JSON structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Deserializers] [Error Propagation] Are deserialization errors properly propagated and logged, or can attackers exploit silent failures where invalid data is accepted without raising errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource.data] [Arbitrary Code Execution] Since Resource.data accepts arbitrary serde_json::Value, can an attacker inject malicious JSON that exploits vulnerabilities in downstream JSON processors or Move VM data interpreters? (Critical)"
