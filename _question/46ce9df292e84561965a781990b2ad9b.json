  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_access.rs] [Concurrency] [Default value race] In get_fungible_store(), the default value on line 131 - can race conditions cause some callers to see the default while others see actual data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_access.rs] [Defaults] [Unsafe default in get_fungible_store] The default FungibleStoreResource uses AccountAddress::TEN - can this hardcoded address collide with real accounts or be exploited in fund tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_access.rs] [Defaults] [Zero initialization] Default sequence numbers and event counters at 0 - can this cause confusion between newly created and uninitialized resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_access.rs] [Defaults] [Frozen flag default] All new resources have frozen=false - can this bypass freeze enforcement during account creation? (Medium)",
