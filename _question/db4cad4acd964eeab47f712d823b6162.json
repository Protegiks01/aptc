  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Static: TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can the TypeTag in TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE be modified at runtime through unsafe code, causing type confusion between withdrawal and deposit events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Static: TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Address mismatch] If TOKEN_ADDRESS used in TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE doesn't match the actual token module address, can this cause events to be ignored or misrouted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event versioning] Does MoveEventV2Type provide backward compatibility, or can changes to event structure break parsing of historical withdrawal events causing audit trail corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Balance consistency] When TokenWithdraw events are emitted, is there atomic verification that the account's token balance is actually decremented, or can events be emitted without actual withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Withdrawal limit bypass] Can TokenWithdraw events be emitted that exceed per-transaction or per-account withdrawal limits, potentially enabling rapid fund extraction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Fee evasion] Can attackers emit TokenWithdraw events that bypass withdrawal fee calculations, allowing free token transfers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Frozen token bypass] If a token is frozen or transfer-disabled, can TokenWithdraw events still be emitted for that token, violating freeze semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Partial withdrawal] If a transaction emits TokenWithdraw but then reverts, are the events properly rolled back, or can orphaned events exist causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Cross-shard inconsistency] In parallel execution with Block-STM, can TokenWithdraw events from different shards cause inconsistent views of token balances across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Event-state divergence] Can the token withdrawal state (actual balances) diverge from the event log of TokenWithdraw events, causing auditing to show incorrect transaction history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Unauthorized emission] Can contracts or accounts without proper authorization emit TokenWithdraw events, potentially creating fake withdrawal records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Signer bypass] If TokenWithdraw events can be emitted without proper signer verification, can attackers create withdrawal events for accounts they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Module boundary violation] Can non-token modules emit TokenWithdraw events by directly constructing the struct, bypassing token module security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Gas exhaustion] Can extremely complex or deeply nested TokenId structures in BCS bytes cause excessive gas consumption during deserialization, enabling DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Event spam] Can attackers emit massive numbers of TokenWithdraw events (even with tiny amounts) to bloat event logs and cause storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory allocation] If TokenId contains unbounded String fields (collection, name), can arbitrarily long strings cause excessive memory allocation in TokenWithdraw construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Signature verification] Are TokenWithdraw events tied to transaction signatures, or can they be emitted by transactions with invalid/missing signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [Account spoofing] Can the account field be set to mimic another user's address during event emission, creating false withdrawal records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [VM type confusion] Can Move VM bytecode manipulations cause TokenWithdraw to be treated as a different type, bypassing event-specific validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event handler bypass] If event handlers check for specific event types, can type tag manipulation cause TokenWithdraw events to skip withdrawal processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Static: TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [VM serialization] When Move VM serializes TokenWithdraw events, can resource exhaustion or incorrect serialization cause validator divergence? (High)",
