  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify() trait] [Signature Bypass] At lines 84-86, does the Verifier trait implementation properly verify that waypoint verification is only accepted after full signature verification of the LedgerInfoWithSignatures, or can this bypass signature checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: epoch_change_verification_required()] [Always True Attack] At lines 88-90, does returning true unconditionally for epoch_change_verification_required allow an attacker to force unnecessary epoch verification even when not needed, causing performance degradation or liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: is_ledger_info_stale()] [Version Comparison] At lines 92-94, can an attacker exploit the simple version comparison (ledger_info.version() < self.version()) to cause nodes to incorrectly reject valid but slightly older ledger infos during concurrent sync? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: is_ledger_info_stale()] [Exactly Equal Version] Does is_ledger_info_stale correctly handle the case where ledger_info.version() == self.version(), or could this cause ambiguity about whether a ledger info at exactly the waypoint version is stale? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: epoch_change_verification_required()] [Unused Parameter] At line 88, the _epoch parameter is unused - can an attacker exploit the fact that waypoints don't check the actual epoch number to accept waypoints from wrong epochs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Copy Trait Safety] At line 29, does the Copy trait implementation on Waypoint allow race conditions where multiple threads might be reading/writing waypoint values during bootstrapping, causing inconsistent trust state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Concurrent Verification] Can multiple threads concurrently call verify() on the same waypoint with different LedgerInfos, potentially causing race conditions in validation logic or shared state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_epoch_boundary()] [TOCTOU Race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between checking ends_epoch() at line 50 and using the LedgerInfo data, where the LedgerInfo could be modified by another thread? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Version Overflow] At line 33, can the Version type (u64) overflow during arithmetic operations like version comparison or increment, causing waypoints to wrap around to version 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Timestamp Overflow] At line 135, can timestamp_usecs overflow or wraparound causing waypoints generated at different times to collide or appear out of order? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Version Subtraction] If version comparison logic elsewhere performs subtraction (version1 - version2), can underflow occur if waypoint version is larger than ledger_info version? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Next Epoch State Cloning] At line 146, does cloning next_epoch_state introduce any security issues if EpochState contains references or shared data that could be modified after waypoint creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Optional Next Epoch State] At lines 136 and 146, can an attacker exploit the Option<EpochState> by providing None when next_epoch_state should exist, or Some when it shouldn't, to manipulate waypoint verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_epoch_boundary()] [Epoch Boundary Definition] At line 50, does the ends_epoch() check properly validate that the LedgerInfo represents a legitimate epoch boundary with a complete validator set transition, or can partial/invalid epochs pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Epoch Number Manipulation] At line 142, can an attacker manipulate the epoch field in LedgerInfo to create waypoints that appear to be from future or past epochs, confusing epoch verification logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Root Hash Manipulation] At line 143, can an attacker provide a manipulated transaction_accumulator_hash that passes waypoint verification but doesn't match the actual transaction history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Trust Bootstrap] Can an attacker exploit the waypoint verification during initial node bootstrap to make a new node accept a forked chain by providing a valid-looking waypoint for an alternative chain history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Waypoint Substitution] If an attacker can substitute the trusted waypoint used by a node (e.g., via config manipulation), can they redirect the node to sync to an attacker-controlled chain without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_epoch_boundary()] [Genesis Waypoint] Can an attacker create a malicious genesis waypoint that appears valid but contains a compromised initial validator set, allowing them to control the chain from the start? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Waypoint Pinning] Does waypoint verification properly prevent an attacker from pinning a node to an old waypoint indefinitely, preventing it from syncing to current state and participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Partial Verification] Can waypoint verification succeed even if the LedgerInfo fails other validation checks (signature verification, quorum certificates, etc.), allowing acceptance of partially valid but ultimately malicious state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Timestamp Manipulation] At line 145, can an attacker manipulate timestamp_usecs to create waypoints that appear to be from the past or future, potentially bypassing time-based validity checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Missing Signature Check] Does excluding signature-related data from waypoint hash computation mean that waypoints don't verify the actual signature quorum was achieved, potentially accepting unsigned LedgerInfo? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Consensus Data Exclusion] At lines 131-137, since consensus_data_hash is excluded, can validators create different block proposals that all produce the same waypoint, breaking consensus on what was actually committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_any()] [Non-Boundary Waypoint Abuse] Can an attacker use new_any() to create waypoints for non-epoch-boundary LedgerInfos and somehow trick the system into accepting them as valid epoch boundaries during sync? (High)"
