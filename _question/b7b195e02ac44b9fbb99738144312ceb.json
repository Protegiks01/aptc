  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: status_code()] [Client error masking] Errors like InvalidInput, InvalidSignatureType, and DeserializationFailed are client errors but return 500 - can this prevent proper client-side validation and cause clients to incorrectly retry errors that will never succeed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: status_code()] [Rate limiting bypass] By returning 500 for all errors, can attackers avoid rate limiting that might be applied to 4xx errors, allowing them to flood the API with invalid requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: status_code()] [Monitoring blind spots] Do monitoring tools correctly alert on 500 errors even when they're client-caused, or can this flood monitoring systems with false positives and hide real server errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [Incorrect error mapping] Line 300 maps InvalidTransactionUpdate to InvalidInput instead of InvalidTransactionUpdate - can this cause transaction update errors to be misclassified and prevent clients from correctly handling gas price update failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [Error code loss] When converting RestError to ApiError, is the original AptosErrorCode preserved or lost, potentially hiding critical information about the underlying failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [WebFrameworkError masking] WebFrameworkError is converted to InternalError - can this hide critical bugs in the Move web framework that should be exposed to developers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [HealthCheckFailed exposure] HealthCheckFailed is converted to InternalError - should this be a more specific error to help operators diagnose node health issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [BcsNotSupported handling] BcsNotSupported is mapped to InvalidInput - is this correct, or should it be a more specific error indicating API capability limitations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [HTTP error information loss] For RestError::Http, only the status code and message are preserved - can additional context like headers or response bodies that might contain security-relevant information be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [Timeout handling] RestError::Timeout is converted to InternalError - should timeouts be retriable to handle temporary network issues, or can this hide persistent network problems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [UrlParse error exposure] UrlParse errors are converted to InternalError with the error string - can malformed URLs in the error message expose internal service endpoints or configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [Unknown error catch-all] RestError::Unknown is caught and converted to InternalError - can this hide unexpected error conditions that should be investigated as potential security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<RestError>] [Bcs/Json deserialization] Both Bcs and Json deserialization errors are converted to DeserializationFailed(None) without details - can this make it impossible to debug malformed transaction submissions that might indicate attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Enum: ApiError] [Variant exhaustiveness] When new error types are added to the upstream REST API (AptosErrorCode), is there a systematic check to ensure they're added to ApiError enum, or can new errors silently fail to be handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Enum: ApiError] [Breaking changes] If ApiError variants are removed or renamed, can this break Rosetta clients that depend on specific error codes, potentially causing fund loss if errors are mishandled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Enum: ApiError] [Option field consistency] Most error variants use Option<String> for details, but some use Option<&'static str> or Option<usize> - can this inconsistency cause serialization issues or make error handling more error-prone? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Enum: ApiError] [Serialization attacks] The enum derives Serialize/Deserialize - can maliciously crafted serialized ApiError values be used to trigger deserialization vulnerabilities or bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AccountAddressParseError>] [Address parsing exploits] Can malformed addresses in AccountAddressParseError messages leak information about valid address formats or be used to probe for address existence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<FromHexError>] [Hex parsing information] FromHexError is converted to DeserializationFailed - can error details expose the malformed hex data, potentially revealing sensitive transaction content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<bcs::Error>] [BCS deserialization details] BCS errors include detailed failure information - can this expose internal data structures or serialization formats that help attackers craft exploit payloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Generic error catch-all] Any anyhow::Error is converted to InternalError - can this hide specific error types that should be handled differently, potentially masking security-critical failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<ParseIntError>] [Integer parsing attacks] ParseIntError details are included in error messages - can this reveal information about expected integer ranges or be used to probe for numeric overflow vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Trait: Reply] [Response hijacking] The Reply implementation converts ApiError to JSON - can the JSON serialization be exploited to inject malicious content or cause XSS if error messages are displayed in web interfaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Trait: Reject] [Rejection handling] ApiError implements warp::reject::Reject - can rejection handling be bypassed or exploited to cause the API to enter an invalid state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Trait: Reply] [into_response()] The into_response() method calls into_error() and serializes to JSON - can large error messages cause memory exhaustion or JSON parsing attacks on clients? (Low)"
