  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: BlockQueue] [No Clear Method] No way to clear queue on epoch change or reset - can stale QueueItems persist across epochs causing consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: QueueItem::new()] [Broadcast Handle Validation] broadcast_handle Option is not validated - can None vs Some(vec) semantics be confused causing DropGuard leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [Byzantine Randomness] Byzantine validator can call set_randomness() with wrong Randomness for their proposed block - is cryptographic verification done elsewhere? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: push_back()] [Byzantine Block Ordering] Byzantine validator can craft OrderedBlocks with blocks in arbitrary order - does first_round() correctly identify true first block? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_rand_ready_prefix()] [Byzantine Dequeue Race] Can Byzantine validator cause dequeue to happen at different times on honest nodes by delaying randomness messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: BlockQueue] [Byzantine Queue State] Can Byzantine validator cause different honest validators to have different queue contents leading to fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: blocks_mut()] [Slice Mutation] Returning &mut [Arc<T>] allows reordering Arc elements - can caller swap blocks breaking offsets_by_round invariant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: QueueItem] [Drop Order] When QueueItem drops, are ordered_blocks and broadcast_handle dropped in safe order? Can DropGuard abort cause issues if blocks reference tasks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: QueueItem::new()] [Clone Semantics] OrderedBlocks is moved into QueueItem - if OrderedBlocks contains Arc, are reference counts properly maintained? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Architecture] [Lack of Synchronization] BlockQueue has no internal locking but is likely accessed from multiple consensus threads - can this cause data races and UB? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [No Quorum Check] set_randomness() accepts Randomness without verifying it was agreed upon by quorum - can single Byzantine validator inject malicious randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_rand_ready_prefix()] [Execution Ordering] Dequeued blocks go to execution - if blocks dequeue out of consensus order due to randomness timing, can this violate state machine safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: QueueItem] [Counter Integrity] num_undecided_blocks is critical for dequeue - if this counter is corrupted through any path (underflow, double-decrement, etc.), can consensus permanently halt? (Critical)"
