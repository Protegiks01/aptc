  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Move VM] [Bytecode Injection During Abort] Can malicious move code executed in the abort hook inject or modify bytecode that affects subsequent session operations or the epilogue? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Move VM] [Resource Safety Violation] Does the abort hook session properly enforce Move's resource safety, or can aborted transactions leave resources in invalid states (copied, dropped without move, etc.)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Move VM] [Global Storage Corruption] Can abort hook code call native functions that modify global storage in ways that violate Move's type safety or resource semantics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Move VM] [Signer Injection] Does the abort hook session receive proper signer capabilities, or can it forge signers for arbitrary accounts, enabling unauthorized operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Move VM] [Abort Within Abort] If the abort hook itself aborts (e.g., create_account_if_does_not_exist fails), is this properly handled or does it cause VM panic/undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Features] [should_create_account_resource Bypass] The abort hook depends on should_create_account_resource feature flag - can an attacker exploit feature flag state transitions to trigger abort hooks when they shouldn't run or skip them when needed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Features] [ChangeSetConfigs Manipulation] If change_set_configs are modified between abort hook creation and finalization, can this cause validation bypass or enable oversized change sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Features] [Sponsored Transaction Exploitation] SPONSORED_AUTOMATIC_ACCOUNT_V1_CREATION feature affects abort hook behavior - can attackers exploit sponsored transactions to trigger abort hooks that create accounts without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Features] [Feature Flag Race] If feature flags are updated mid-execution, can abort hook behavior become inconsistent with prologue expectations, causing state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Features] [Orderless Transaction Abort] SessionId supports OrderlessRunOnAbort - are orderless transaction aborts handled securely, or can nonce/expiration manipulation enable replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Auth] [Sender Validation Bypass] Does SessionId::run_on_abort properly validate that txn_meta.sender is authorized to trigger the abort hook, or can an attacker impersonate other users during abort handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Auth] [Script Hash Tampering] The script_hash in SessionId comes from txn_metadata - can this be manipulated to bypass script-based authorization checks during abort hook execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Auth] [User Transaction Context Forgery] The as_user_transaction_context() provides context to the session - can this be forged to escalate privileges or bypass access controls? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Determinism] [Non-Deterministic Abort Hook] Are all operations in the abort hook session deterministic across validators, or can non-determinism cause different validators to produce different state roots after abort handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Determinism] [Timestamp Dependency] If abort hook code depends on block timestamp or other non-deterministic data, can this cause consensus divergence between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Determinism] [Random Number Usage] Can abort hook operations access randomness APIs that might differ across validator executions, breaking determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [State Consistency] [Partial Application] If finish() partially applies the change set before encountering an error, can this leave the system in an inconsistent intermediate state? (High)",
