  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Maximum Players] Is there a practical limit on num_players? Could creating configs with millions of players cause memory exhaustion or computational DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_share_index()] [Zero Weight Player] If weights[i] = 0, can get_share_index(i, 0) ever return Some? Should zero-weight players be filtered out during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Empty Shares Vector] What happens if reconstruct() is called with an empty shares vector? Does it fail gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_best_case_eligible_subset_of_players()] [All Equal Weights] If all players have equal weight, does best-case vs worst-case make any difference? Could this cause confusion in subset selection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Malicious Share Withholding] Can Byzantine validators with < 1/3 total weight refuse to provide shares, preventing reconstruction even when honest validators have >= threshold weight? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Griefing Attack] Can Byzantine players repeatedly trigger reconstruction with invalid shares, forcing honest validators to waste computation time in failed reconstruction attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Weight Inflation Attack] Can a Byzantine validator during setup propose inflated weights for colluding validators, enabling them to control reconstruction with < 1/3 of actual validator count? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_virtual_player()] [Virtual Player Impersonation] Can Byzantine validators craft fake virtual player IDs to submit shares for players they don't represent, disrupting reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [All Functions] [Configuration Divergence] If Byzantine validators broadcast different WeightedConfig instances to different honest validators, could this cause permanent network split in PVSS operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Liveness Failure] If reconstruction fails due to bugs in this file, could it prevent distributed key generation (DKG) from completing, halting validator set updates and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Subset Selection Divergence] If different validators select different eligible subsets due to RNG issues, could they fail to coordinate on which validators should participate in reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization Disagreement] If validators disagree on the correct WeightedConfig during PVSS setup, could this cause permanent inability to perform DKG, freezing validator set changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_virtual_player()] [Panic Attack] Can attackers deliberately trigger the assert_lt! at line 168 by providing j >= weight, causing validator panic during normal PVSS operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_min_weight_player()] [Unreachable Panic] The panics at lines 112 and 127 should be unreachable, but could unsafe code elsewhere corrupt memory making them reachable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: pop_eligible_subset()] [Unwrap Panic] The unwrap() at line 253 assumes the vector is non-empty. Could logic errors cause this to be called on an empty vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_virtual_player()] [Unwrap Chain] Line 170 calls unwrap() on Option. Are there any code paths where get_share_index() returns None for valid inputs? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [O(n*m) Complexity] The nested loops at lines 361-376 iterate over all players and all sub-shares. Could this cause O(n²) or worse performance for large validator sets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: sort_players_by_weight()] [Sorting Cost] Does the O(n log n) sort at line 244 become prohibitive for large num_players? Could this be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
