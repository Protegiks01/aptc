  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_resources_by_pagination()] [Resource group expansion] When expanding ResourceGroup, does the function properly validate that all nested resources belong to the same account, preventing cross-account resource leakage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_resources_by_pagination()] [Limit overflow] Can an attacker provide limit + 1 items check to trigger integer overflow when calculating the pagination window? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_resources_by_pagination()] [State key inconsistency] The function logs errors for inconsistent keys but continues - can this hide critical state corruption that should halt the API? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_resources_by_pagination()] [BCS deserialization of ResourceGroup] If bcs::from_bytes::<ResourceGroup> fails, does it properly prevent partial resource exposure from corrupted state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Height boundary] Can requesting block at height == oldest_block_height exactly (not <) trigger off-by-one errors in pruning logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Block info race] Is there a race where get_block_info_by_height succeeds but the block gets pruned before get_block() reads transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_block_by_version()] [Version pruning check] The function checks version < oldest_ledger_version, but does it handle the case where version is being pruned concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_block()] [Future block detection] The check last_version > ledger_version prevents future blocks, but can race conditions allow accessing uncommitted blocks? (High)",
