(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inlining_optimization.rs] [Functions: pick_from_eligible_and_compute_cost() + inline_call_sites() size update] [Budget Tracking Inconsistency] Can the new_size computed by pick_from_eligible_and_compute_cost() diverge from the actual size after CallerRewriter finishes inlining, causing future inlining decisions to use incorrect size information? (High)",

(Medium)",
