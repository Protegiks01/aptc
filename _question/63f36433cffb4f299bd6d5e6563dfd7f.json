  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Safety: Epoch Confusion] Can validators in different epochs elect leaders from wrong validator sets due to epoch_to_proposers misalignment? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Economic: Low-Stake Domination] Can validators with high reputation but low stake unfairly dominate leader selection, breaking stake-weighted security? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Economic: Reputation Farming] Can validators game the system by being highly active in vote casting but rarely getting selected as leader? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Economic: Censorship] Can high-reputation validators censor transactions by being frequently selected but producing empty blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Economic: Unfair Rewards] Does reputation-based selection affect block reward distribution, and can this be exploited for unfair advantage? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge: reputation_window_from_stale_end Toggle] The boolean flag changes window selection logic - can inconsistent configuration across validators cause divergent leader election? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge: First Block of Epoch] At epoch start with no history, does the system gracefully handle empty windows or does it break? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge: Very Long Epoch] If an epoch runs for millions of rounds, can any counters overflow or windows become ineffective? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge: Validator Leaves] When a validator leaves the set mid-epoch, are their historical votes/proposals properly excluded from new reputation calculations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Edge: Validator Joins] When new validators join, do they start with inactive_weight, and can this be exploited to exclude new honest nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Interaction: Multi-Epoch History] When history spans multiple epochs with different validator sets, can misalignment in epoch_to_candidates cause wrong attribution? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Interaction: Concurrent Rounds] If multiple rounds process simultaneously (due to fast block time), can race conditions in backend.get_block_metadata() cause issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Interaction: Reconfiguration] During validator set reconfiguration, can stale cached data cause new validators to use old validator set for leader election? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Interaction: Network Partition] If validators are partitioned, can they elect different leaders due to seeing different histories, causing fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Interaction: Database Pruning] If old blocks are pruned mid-computation, can this cause partial window to be used affecting fairness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Arithmetic: sample_fraction Division] The calculation 'participants_window_size / 10' - can division by 10 with small windows cause sample_fraction=0? (Medium)",
