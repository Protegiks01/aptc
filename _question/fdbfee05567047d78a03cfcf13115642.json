  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted address string to AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() at line 48 that causes panic or undefined behavior instead of proper error handling, potentially crashing the debugging tool or exposing internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker supply an invalid StructTag string at line 49 that gets parsed incorrectly by StructTag::from_str(), leading to creation of a malformed StateKey that could bypass validation checks or access unintended state data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Error handling failure] The unwrap() call on AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() at line 48 will panic on invalid input - can this be exploited to cause denial of service by repeatedly triggering panics when the tool is used in automated systems or monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [StateKey construction vulnerability] At line 50, StateKey::resource() is called with user-controlled address and struct_tag - can an attacker craft inputs that create a StateKey pointing to privileged system resources, governance contracts, or validator stake data, enabling unauthorized information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Unused parameter security] The key_hex parameter at line 22 is defined but never used (commented out code at lines 36-46) - does this indicate incomplete input validation that could be exploited if the commented code is later enabled without proper sanitization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Path traversal] The db_dir field is used to open databases at lines 52-53 - can an attacker supply a malicious PathBuf through CLI arguments containing '../' sequences to access arbitrary database files outside the intended directory, leading to unauthorized state disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Database handle leakage] Are the opened database handles (ledger_db at line 52, db at line 53) properly closed after execution, or could repeated invocations cause file descriptor exhaustion in production monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Concurrent access] If multiple instances of this debugging tool run concurrently accessing the same db_dir, can race conditions in database read operations cause inconsistent state reads or database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Database lock contention] Does opening the state_kv_db at line 53 acquire locks that could interfere with validator consensus operations if this debugging tool is run on a live validator node during critical epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Integer underflow] At line 86, version - 1 is computed without checking if version == 0 - although there's a break at line 84, can timing or race conditions cause version to be 0 when line 86 executes, resulting in integer underflow to u64::MAX and querying the maximum version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Version validation bypass] At line 59, Version::MAX is checked - can an attacker deliberately pass Version::MAX to bypass the comparison at line 59 and force querying at the maximum possible version, potentially accessing uncommitted or invalid state data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Version overflow attack] If latest_version returned at line 54-57 is close to u64::MAX and self.version is also near the limit, can arithmetic operations during the version comparison at line 59 cause overflow conditions that bypass the warning and access invalid versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Historical state manipulation] The loop at lines 72-89 iterates backwards through versions - can an attacker deliberately query ancient historical states (version 0 or near-0) to cause excessive database seeks and slow down validator operations if this tool runs on production infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Sensitive data exposure] At lines 94-103, state values are printed to stdout without any access control or sanitization - can this expose private validator keys, governance proposal details, or user account balances if the debugging output is logged or captured by monitoring systems? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Metadata leakage] At line 102, value.into_metadata() is printed, exposing internal state metadata - can this reveal cryptographic randomness, slot information, or internal state tree structure that could be used to predict validator behavior or optimize attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Version disclosure] At line 58, latest_version is printed unconditionally - does this expose the current blockchain height to unauthorized users, enabling timing attacks or revealing when the validator is processing specific transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Size-based information leakage] At line 97, the condition checks if value.bytes().len() > 1024 - can an attacker use this size threshold to infer the type or structure of stored resources, enabling reconnaissance attacks to identify high-value accounts or contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Empty database leak] At line 57, expect(",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Hardcoded loop limit] The loop at line 72 is hardcoded to count < 10 - can an attacker request historical state at a version requiring more than 10 iterations to reach, causing incomplete results that might hide evidence of state manipulation or fund theft in deeper history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Database query amplification] Each iteration at line 73 calls get_state_value_with_version_by_version() which performs database seeks - can an attacker rapidly invoke this tool with many different keys to cause excessive disk I/O, degrading validator performance during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Memory exhaustion] At line 80, StateValue objects are passed to print_value() - if these values are extremely large (multi-MB resources), can repeated queries cause memory exhaustion in monitoring systems that capture stdout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Infinite loop potential] If get_state_value_with_version_by_version() at line 73 consistently returns the same version due to a database bug, could the version - 1 at line 86 fail to progress, causing the loop to run exactly 10 times but with redundant queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Silent failure] At line 74, None is returned but only causes a break after printing a message at line 76 - can this hide database corruption or state inconsistencies that should be reported as errors rather than gracefully continuing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Inconsistent state reads] The get_state_value_with_version_by_version() call at line 73 reads historical state - if the database is being actively modified by consensus, can concurrent writes cause torn reads where the returned state doesn't correspond to any valid blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Error propagation failure] Multiple ? operators are used (lines 49, 52, 53, 56, 73) - are all database errors properly propagated up, or could critical errors like disk failures be silently converted to Ok(()) at line 91?
