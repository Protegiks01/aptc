  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_data_and_delta()] [PanicOr error type] The function returns PanicOr<DelayedFieldsSpeculativeError> - can an attacker exploit the panic path to bypass proper error handling and cause validator crashes during transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_data_and_delta()] [Max value parameter] The function takes max_value as parameter but also validates against it - can an attacker provide inconsistent max_value between validation and merge to exploit TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_data_and_delta()] [Return value usage] The function returns the merged u128 value - can an attacker exploit incorrect usage of this returned value in calling code to apply the delta twice or skip validation steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_two_deltas()] [Delta addition overflow] Line 351 uses BoundedMath::signed_add() to combine prev_delta and next_delta - can an attacker craft two deltas that individually are within bounds but whose sum overflows the signed range [-max_value, max_value], causing expect_ok() to panic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_two_deltas()] [History merge ordering] The function merges histories BEFORE combining deltas (line 350 before 351) - can an attacker exploit this ordering to create scenarios where history merge succeeds but delta merge fails, leaving partial state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_two_deltas()] [expect_ok() failure] Line 351 uses expect_ok() on signed_add result - can an attacker trigger this panic by providing deltas that pass history merge but fail signed addition, crashing validators during parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Function: merge_two_deltas()] [Commutativity assumption] Does the function assume delta merging is commutative (prev + next == next + prev)?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Cross-function: record_success + validate_against_base_value] [State machine violation] Can an attacker call record_success() with deltas that create history states which always pass validate_against_base_value() regardless of the actual base_value, effectively disabling validation for all subsequent operations?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/delta_math.rs] [Cross-function: record_overflow + record_underflow] [Contradictory history] Can an attacker alternate between causing overflows and underflows to create a history where both min_overflow_positive_delta and max_underflow_negative_delta exist with values that make validation impossible for any base_value?
