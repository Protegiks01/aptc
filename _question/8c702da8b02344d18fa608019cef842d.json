  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: ConnectionNotification] [Malicious metadata] Can a Byzantine validator send ConnectionNotification with maliciously crafted ConnectionMetadata (e.g., fake addresses, timestamps) to mislead honest nodes about peer connectivity state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Colluding validators] Can colluding Byzantine validators coordinate to flood the channel with connection events at specific timing windows to cause honest validators to miss epoch transition notifications, affecting validator set updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [Hot path performance] Since connection notifications are on the hot path for peer management, can the LIFO queue with constant eviction cause excessive allocation/deallocation overhead, degrading validator performance during high network activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Push contention] Can high contention on Sender::push() from multiple concurrent connection events cause lock contention or blocking, degrading overall peer manager responsiveness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Processing bottleneck] If the receiver processing is slow compared to connection event rate, can this create a systematic bottleneck where the system cannot keep up with legitimate connection churn, affecting network scalability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Cascading failures] If one connection_event_handler fails or becomes slow, does this affect other handlers' ability to receive notifications through the shared channel infrastructure, causing cascading failures across network components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Test: send_n_get_1()] [Assertion granularity] The test asserts that select_next_some().now_or_never() returns None to verify queue is empty - but can this miss subtle bugs where messages are present but not immediately ready, causing false test passes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Test: send_n_get_1()] [Mock peer IDs] The test uses PeerId::random() - does this adequately test scenarios with specific PeerId patterns that might cause hash collisions or other key-related issues in the PerKeyQueue? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [None counters] Setting counters to None disables metrics - can this prevent detecting anomalies in production like excessive message dropping or unusual connection patterns that might indicate attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: ConnectionNotification] [Clone cost] ConnectionNotification is cloned when pushed to multiple handlers - if ConnectionMetadata is large, can this cloning overhead cause performance degradation or memory pressure under high connection churn? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Shutdown ordering] When the system shuts down, what is the order of dropping Sender vs Receiver? Can incorrect shutdown ordering cause panics or data loss of pending connection notifications? (Low)"
