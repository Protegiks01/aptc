  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All open_*_db() Functions] [Snapshot Isolation] Do the database opens guarantee snapshot isolation, or can concurrent validator writes be partially visible causing inconsistent debugger query results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: open_ledger_db()] [Transaction Ordering] Can opening LedgerDb with wrong sharding config cause transaction ordering to be incorrect, breaking transaction replay functionality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [I/O Amplification] Can opening multiple database instances simultaneously cause I/O amplification that slows down the validator node's consensus participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Algorithmic Complexity] Is parse_nibble_path() O(n) complexity, or can specially crafted inputs trigger O(n²) behavior causing DoS of debugger operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All open_*_db() Functions] [Cache Thrashing] With block_cache = None, can debugger queries evict hot data from the validator's cache, degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Constant: PAGE_SIZE] [Pagination Bypass] Can attackers request page numbers that bypass PAGE_SIZE limits, allowing them to retrieve entire database contents in a single query? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Null Character Injection] Can null bytes ('\\0') in the nibble path string cause string truncation leading to partial path parsing and wrong tree navigation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Database Corruption Detection] Do the database open functions validate database integrity before allowing access, or can corrupted databases be opened causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: DbDir] [Environment Variable Injection] Can environment variables influence db_dir path resolution, allowing attackers to redirect database access to malicious locations? (Medium)"
