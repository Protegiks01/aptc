  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Reverse Iterator Exploit] Does the rev() call on the iterator properly handle empty or single-element iterators, or can edge cases cause elements to be visited in wrong order, breaking dependency resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Reference Lifetime Violation] Since the function pushes (&'a AccountAddress, &'a IdentStr) tuples to the stack, can these references outlive their source data if the stack is used after the TraversalContext is dropped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Generic Iterator Attack] Can an attacker provide a malicious iterator implementation that violates DoubleEndedIterator invariants, causing undefined behavior in the rev() operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Partial Push Failure] If visit_if_not_special_address() succeeds for some elements but stack.push() fails for others due to memory exhaustion, does the function leave the visited map in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Iterator Side Effects] Can an attacker provide an iterator with side effects (modifying global state during iteration) that corrupts the traversal process or causes non-deterministic behavior across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [Error Message Information Leak] Does the format!() call revealing the unvisited module address and name leak sensitive information about system internals that could help attackers plan further exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR Abuse] Can an attacker trigger UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR intentionally to mask other errors or cause validators to misclassify the failure, leading to inconsistent error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_is_special_or_visited()] [Early Return Bypass] Does the early return for special addresses properly sanitize the address value, or can an attacker craft addresses that appear special but have malicious side effects when used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: legacy_check_visited()] [Legacy Function Exploitation] Since legacy_check_visited() skips the is_special() check, can attackers exploit old code paths that still call this function to bypass special address protections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [Format String Attack] Can an attacker craft module addresses or names containing format string specifiers that cause format!() to crash or exhibit undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext<'a>] [Lifetime Covariance Exploit] Can an attacker exploit Rust lifetime variance rules to extend the 'a lifetime beyond the actual lifetime of TraversalStorage, causing dangling references in the visited map? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: TraversalContext::new()] [Mutable Aliasing] Since TraversalContext holds multiple &'a Arena references, can an attacker obtain mutable access to the same Arena through unsafe code while immutable references exist, violating Rust's aliasing rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext.visited] [Reference Invalidation on Reallocation] When BTreeMap grows and reallocates, do the (&'a AccountAddress, &'a IdentStr) keys remain valid, or can reallocation invalidate the references stored in the map? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Self-Reference Cycle] Can the combination of BTreeMap and Arena create self-referential cycles where the visited map holds references to arena-allocated data that itself references the visited map? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Gas Metering Bypass] Since visited modules are not charged gas again, can an attacker exploit the visited tracking to load expensive modules once, then reuse them without gas charges in subsequent transactions within the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_is_special_or_visited()] [Deterministic Gas Failure] If different validators have slightly different visited states due to race conditions or initialization order, will they charge different gas amounts for the same transaction, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_module_id()] [Gas Accounting Race] Can the window between checking visited state and charging gas be exploited to cause some validators to charge gas while others don't, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalStorage] [Cross-Transaction State Leak] If TraversalStorage is reused across transactions without proper reset, can an attacker exploit leaked visited state to avoid gas charges for modules that should be charged in the new transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext] [Non-Sync Violation] Since TraversalContext is not Send/Sync, can an attacker exploit parallel execution (Block-STM) by causing concurrent access to the same TraversalContext, leading to data races and undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalStorage] [Arena Thread Safety] Does typed_arena::Arena provide thread safety guarantees, or can concurrent allocations from different threads corrupt the arena state and cause memory safety violations? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext.visited] [BTreeMap Concurrent Modification] If multiple threads access the same TraversalContext (violating Rust safety but possible via unsafe), can concurrent insertions to BTreeMap cause corruption or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalStorage] [Arena Memory Leak] Since Arena never deallocates until dropped, can an attacker submit many transactions that force arena growth without triggering deallocation, causing validators to exhaust memory over time? (High)",
