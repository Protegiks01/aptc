  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: OptimisticFetchResponse] [Data Leakage] Do 'OptimisticFetchResponse' logs include response payloads that could leak uncommitted state data or speculative execution results before consensus finalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.optimistic_fetch_related] [Context Leak] Can the 'optimistic_fetch_related' boolean flag leak information about which requests are part of optimistic fetching, enabling attacks that target the optimistic fetch mechanism? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: SubscriptionRefresh] [State Tracking] Can 'SubscriptionRefresh' log entries enable attackers to track subscription lifecycle and identify optimal timing for attacks during subscription state transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: SubscriptionResponse] [Data Exposure] Do 'SubscriptionResponse' logs leak state update patterns or transaction flow information that enables MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks or front-running? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: RequestModeratorIgnoredPeer] [Rate Limiting Bypass] Can attackers monitor 'RequestModeratorIgnoredPeer' logs to reverse-engineer rate limiting algorithms and craft requests that evade moderation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: RequestModeratorRefresh] [Timing Attack] Do 'RequestModeratorRefresh' log entries reveal the frequency of moderator state updates, enabling attackers to time requests to bypass rate limiting during refresh windows? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: ReceivedCacheUpdateNotification] [State Inference] Can 'ReceivedCacheUpdateNotification' logs reveal cache update patterns that enable attackers to infer which data is cached and optimize cache poisoning attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: StorageSummaryRefresh] [Topology Discovery] Do 'StorageSummaryRefresh' logs expose storage capacity, available data ranges, or validator capabilities that help attackers target vulnerable validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: ReceivedCommitNotification] [Consensus Timing] Can 'ReceivedCommitNotification' log timing enable attackers to correlate commit events across validators and identify network propagation delays for consensus attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Type Confusion] Since LogEntry uses Serialize trait, can an attacker exploit type confusion in serialization to inject malicious data types that break log parsers or analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Deserialization] Although LogEntry only derives Serialize (not Deserialize), could future addition of Deserialize enable deserialization attacks if logs are ever read back into the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [PII Exposure] Can the logging schema inadvertently capture personally identifiable information (PII) from transaction data or peer metadata, creating regulatory compliance risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Forensic Value] In case of a Byzantine attack or consensus failure, does the LogSchema capture sufficient context (timestamps, sequence numbers, cryptographic hashes) for post-incident forensic analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Rotation] If log rotation is not properly implemented, can unbounded log growth from LogSchema instances cause disk exhaustion and validator node failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does LogSchema::new() perform any validation or sanitization of the LogEntry parameter, or can invalid enum values cause undefined behavior in logging infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Builder Pattern Safety] Since LogSchema uses a builder pattern with Option<T> fields, can partially-constructed log entries be accidentally logged with missing critical fields, breaking audit requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: SentStorageResponse] [Response Correlation] Can 'SentStorageResponse' logs be correlated with 'ReceivedStorageRequest' logs across validators to map request routing and identify single points of failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Memory Safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or FFI calls in the logging infrastructure that could be triggered by malformed LogSchema instances, causing memory corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Schema Evolution] If LogSchema fields are added/removed in future versions, can schema incompatibilities break log aggregation across validators running different versions, causing monitoring blind spots? (Medium)"
