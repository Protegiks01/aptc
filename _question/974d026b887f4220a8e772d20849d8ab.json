  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Multiple build calls] Can build() at line 106 be called multiple times on the same Builder, and does std::mem::take at line 121 ensure directives are properly moved each time without causing use-after-move errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::filter()] [Method chaining side effects] Does the mutable reference return at line 92 allow method chaining that could interleave with concurrent operations in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::new()] [Default initialization] Does Default::default() at line 64 initialize directives to an empty vec, and could this cause issues if Builder is used before any filter methods are called? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: LevelFilter (enum)] [Ordering invariant] Does the PartialOrd/Ord implementation at line 13 match the semantic ordering Off < Error < Warn < Info < Debug < Trace, or could enum discriminant ordering cause incorrect comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Filter::enabled()] [Off level handling] When a directive has level Off, does the comparison at line 142 correctly suppress all logging for that module, or could Off be treated as a valid level allowing some logs through? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::filter_module()] [Parameter validation] Does filter_module() at line 77 validate that the module string is non-empty and well-formed, or could empty/invalid modules cause filter bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::filter_level()] [Global override] Can filter_level() at line 82 be used to accidentally override all specific module filters, causing debug logging to be enabled globally when only specific modules were intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Filter::builder()] [Builder lifecycle] Does the builder() constructor at line 133 enforce proper usage patterns, or could incomplete Builder setup lead to insecure default filters? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Duplicate handling] If parse() adds duplicate directives for the same module at different levels, how are they resolved during sorting and matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::parse()] [Order dependency] Does the order of directives in the input string matter, or could reordering the same directives produce different filtering behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Filter::enabled()] [Consensus protection] Are there hard-coded protections to prevent trace-level logging of consensus-critical modules regardless of filter configuration, or could misconfiguration expose Byzantine validator strategies?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::with_env()] [System module override] Can environment variables override built-in protections for system modules like 'aptos_crypto' or 'safety_rules', potentially exposing cryptographic material? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::parse()] [Blacklist bypass] If there's a blacklist of sensitive modules that should never be logged at debug/trace, can attackers use module path variations or prefix matching to bypass these restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [std::mem::take safety] Does the std::mem::take() at line 121 properly handle all edge cases, or could there be scenarios where directives are moved while still being referenced? (Medium)",
