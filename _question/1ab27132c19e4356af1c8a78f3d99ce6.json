  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator Verifier State] Is ValidatorVerifier guaranteed to be in a consistent state during verify(), or could concurrent validator set updates cause verify() to use partially-updated validator information? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [SignatureWithStatus Default State] What is the default verification state when SignatureWithStatus is created via from(signature) on line 54, and could it incorrectly default to verified=true? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Serialization Determinism] Is the serialization of OrderVote deterministic across different Rust versions, platforms, and endianness, or could serialization non-determinism cause signature verification failures across heterogeneous validator sets? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Error Message Information Disclosure] Do the error messages from verify() (line 87 and 91) leak information about validator set composition, signature verification internals, or other sensitive data that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: author()] [Author Copy vs Reference] Does returning Author by value (line 58-60) instead of by reference prevent accidental mutation, or are there scenarios where copied Authors could become desynchronized from the signed Author? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Anyhow Error Context] Does using anyhow::Result properly preserve error types and stack traces for debugging security incidents, or could important error details be lost in the context wrapping on line 91? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Struct Alignment] Could struct field alignment or padding in OrderVote create uninitialized memory that gets serialized and sent over the network, potentially leaking validator memory contents? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Partial Initialization] Is there any unsafe code path where OrderVote could be partially initialized (e.g., via std::mem::uninitialized) leaving fields with garbage values that bypass security checks? (High)"
