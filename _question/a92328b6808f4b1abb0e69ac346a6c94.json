  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateAdminWriteSet::execute()] [Script type validation] Does Script::new() validate that the bytecode is a valid Move script (not a module), preventing attackers from deploying modules via writeset? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateAdminWriteSet::execute()] [BCS deserialization attack] When the writeset file is later loaded and deserialized, can malformed BCS at line 341 cause crashes, memory corruption, or exploitation of deserialization bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateAdminWriteSet::execute()] [File path injection] Can output_file contain path traversal, symbolic links, or special characters that cause write_to_user_only_file() to write to unintended locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateAdminWriteSet::execute()] [Prompt bypass] Can prompt_options be manipulated to automatically approve overwriting critical writeset files without user confirmation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateAdminWriteSet::execute()] [Load account vulnerability] Line 311 uses load_account_arg to parse execute_as - can this parser be exploited with malformed addresses to cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: GenerateKeys + SetValidatorConfiguration] [Key mismatch] Can GenerateKeys produce keys that don't match the format expected by SetValidatorConfiguration, causing silent failures during genesis that leave validators unable to participate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: All file operations] [Atomic consistency] If multiple commands (GenerateKeys, SetValidatorConfiguration, GenerateLayoutTemplate) are run concurrently, can race conditions create inconsistent state where validator configurations reference non-existent keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: File constants] [Filename collision] Do PRIVATE_KEYS_FILE, PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE, VALIDATOR_FILE, VFN_FILE, OPERATOR_FILE, OWNER_FILE, and LAYOUT_FILE have unique names that can't collide when multiple validators generate keys in the same directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: Git operations] [Concurrent git access] Can multiple SetValidatorConfiguration commands running concurrently cause git merge conflicts, corrupted repository state, or lost validator configurations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: PromptOptions] [Denial of interaction] Can prompt_options be set to disable all prompts, allowing automated tools to overwrite critical files without human oversight during genesis setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: Directory structure] [Nested directory attack] If output_dir or username contain deeply nested paths (./a/b/c/d/e/.../z), can filesystem limits be hit causing creation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: Error recovery] [Partial state cleanup] If any execute() function fails midway, are temporary files, directories, or git changes properly rolled back to prevent inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: Public vs Private keys] [Key leakage] Can private_keys.yaml and public-keys.yaml be confused by operators, causing them to accidentally publish private keys to public repositories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Integration: CliTypedResult] [Error type confusion] Do all functions properly convert between CliError types, or can error handling bugs cause wrong error messages or hide critical failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateKeys] [Disk space exhaustion] If output_dir is on a nearly-full filesystem, can partial key file writes leave the system in an unrecoverable state with some keys written but others missing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateKeys] [Symbolic link attacks] Can output_dir be a symlink to a sensitive directory, causing private keys to be written to /etc/ or other critical system paths? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [SetValidatorConfiguration] [Empty username] If username is an empty string, can this create invalid directory paths or cause all validators to write to the same location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [SetValidatorConfiguration] [Host parsing] Does HostAndPort properly validate host format, port ranges (1-65535), and reject invalid hosts like empty strings or malformed IP addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [SetValidatorConfiguration] [Commission bounds] Is commission_percentage validated to be <= 100, or can values like 150 be set causing validators to claim 150% of rewards? (High)",
