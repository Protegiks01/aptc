  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::generate()] [Panic on expect] The key_gen call uses expect() which could panic - can an attacker trigger this condition to cause validator crashes during key generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::generate()] [Side-channel leakage] Does the key generation process leak timing or power consumption information that could be exploited to recover generated keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::genesis()] [Hardcoded key] The genesis function creates a predictable key from a hardcoded pattern (all zeros except last byte = 1) - is this key used in production, allowing attackers to compromise the genesis validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::genesis()] [Weak key] The genesis key has extremely low entropy - if used for any consensus or validation, can an attacker trivially compute this key and forge signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::genesis()] [TryFrom failure] The unwrap() call assumes deserialization always succeeds - what if the hardcoded bytes become invalid in future blst versions causing genesis initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign()] [Domain separation weakness] The function uses DST_BLS_SIG_IN_G2_WITH_POP - is this DST properly unique from other signature schemes to prevent cross-protocol attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign()] [Message hashing failure] The signing_message() call can return an error - is error handling sufficient or could failed message serialization lead to signing incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign()] [Determinism] Are signatures completely deterministic for the same message and key, or could non-determinism cause validators to produce different signatures breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign()] [Empty augmentation] The aug parameter is empty (&[]) - should message augmentation be used for additional security, and could its absence enable attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign()] [Side-channel leakage] Does the signing operation leak private key bits through timing, power, or cache side channels enabling key recovery attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign_arbitrary_message()] [Test code in production] This function is marked cfg(test, feature = 'fuzzing') - if accidentally enabled in production, can attackers bypass CryptoHash validation and sign arbitrary malicious data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign_arbitrary_message()] [No message validation] Unlike sign(), this function skips signing_message() serialization - could this enable signing of malformed or malicious messages in test/fuzzing scenarios that leak into production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::to_bytes()] [Key exposure] Does serializing private keys to bytes create opportunities for key material to be logged, transmitted, or stored insecurely leading to key theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::to_bytes()] [No zeroization] After to_bytes() returns, is the byte array properly zeroized to prevent private key material from remaining in memory and being extracted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::to_bytes()] [Determinism] Is the serialization format stable across blst versions, or could changes break key recovery from backups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]> for PrivateKey] [Invalid scalar] Can an attacker deserialize scalars outside the valid range [0, r-1] where r is the curve order, leading to undefined behavior or weak keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]> for PrivateKey] [Zero key attack] Can an attacker deserialize the zero scalar as a private key, which would produce the identity element as public key and enable signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]> for PrivateKey] [Length validation] Does the function validate input length is exactly PrivateKey::LENGTH (32 bytes), or can malformed inputs cause memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]> for PrivateKey] [Error suppression] The function maps all blst errors to DeserializationError - could specific error conditions be exploited if not handled distinctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: Clone for PrivateKey] [Feature gate bypass] The clone implementation is gated by 'cloneable-private-keys' feature - if this feature is accidentally enabled, could it enable key duplication attacks or key leakage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: Clone for PrivateKey] [Memory exposure] The clone creates intermediate serialized key bytes - are these properly zeroized to prevent key material from being recovered from memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: Clone for PrivateKey] [Unwrap panic] The unwrap() call assumes deserialization always succeeds - could this panic if memory corruption occurs between serialization and deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: From<&PrivateKey> for PublicKey] [Invalid key derivation] If the private key is invalid (e.g., zero), does sk_to_pk() produce a valid public key or could it create the identity element enabling signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: From<&PrivateKey> for PublicKey] [No subgroup check] The derived public key is not subgroup-checked during derivation - could this produce invalid PKs if the underlying blst library has bugs? (Medium)",
