  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Signature throughput] Can Vault's signing throughput limit validator block proposal rates, causing the validator to fall behind and lose rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: key_version()] [Version lookup efficiency] Does linear search through all key versions in key_version() scale poorly with many rotations, degrading signing performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: secret_versions] [HashMap size] Can the secret_versions HashMap become a memory bottleneck with thousands of secrets, causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Retry logic] If Vault operations fail transiently, is there retry logic with exponential backoff, or do transient failures cascade into validator shutdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: available()] [Health checks] Is available() called before each operation, or only once at startup, potentially missing Vault becoming unavailable during operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Write failures] Can partial write failures (e.g., network interruption mid-write) leave Vault in inconsistent state corrupting validator configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Nonce/randomness] Does Ed25519 signing in Vault use proper nonce generation, or could nonce reuse allow private key recovery from signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Key generation entropy] Does create_ed25519_key() use sufficient entropy from a secure random source, or can weak keys be generated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Hash domain separation] Is the CryptoHasher seed sufficient for domain separation, or can signatures on different message types be confused allowing cross-protocol attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Key validation] Does import check that the private key is valid (non-zero, in correct range), or can invalid keys cause signing failures or worse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: crypto_name()] [Validator isolation] Can validators in shared Vault deployments access each other's keys through namespace manipulation or policy misconfigurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::name()] [Namespace confusion] If namespace is None in VaultPolicy, does this cause all validators to share the same unnamespaced keys creating signing conflicts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::create_token()] [Token scope] Can tokens created by create_token() access more than intended due to overly broad policy attachment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Clock skew] If validator system clock differs from Vault server clock, can this cause token renewals to fail or succeed at wrong times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Timestamp overflow] In 2038 or beyond, can timestamp overflow in 'timestamp() as u64' cause incorrect last_update values breaking time-based validations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Time manipulation] Can an attacker with control over creation_time in Vault responses manipulate last_update to bypass freshness checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::set_policy()] [Policy overwrite] Can set_policy() overwrite existing policies without checking, accidentally removing critical access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::reset_policies()] [Privilege escalation] After reset_policies(), does policy recreation maintain proper access restrictions, or can attackers exploit the reset window? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::set_policy()] [Capability confusion] Can Export capability be confused with Read, allowing unauthorized key exports when only read access was intended? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Buffer handling] In 'bcs::serialize_into(&mut bytes, &message)', can message serialization cause buffer overflows or heap corruption with malicious inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [String handling] Can malicious UTF-8 in secret keys or values cause panics in string operations like replace() and rsplit_once()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [Drop behavior] Does VaultStorage implement Drop correctly to clear sensitive data like tokens from memory on destruction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [Client errors] Does proper error conversion from aptos_vault_client::Error to Error preserve security-relevant details without leaking secrets? (Low)",
