  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Configuration validation] Does Process::new() validate that the SafetyRulesConfig.service is actually SafetyRulesService::Process before proceeding, or can a mismatched service type cause a panic after storage initialization, potentially leaving corrupted safety data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Panic vulnerability] The function panics if config.service is not SafetyRulesService::Process - can an attacker provide a malicious configuration that causes validator crash during safety rules initialization, leading to consensus liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Storage initialization race] Does safety_rules_manager::storage() perform atomic initialization, or can concurrent Process::new() calls on the same storage backend cause race conditions leading to corrupted PersistentSafetyStorage state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Network address validation] Is RemoteService.server_address() validated before being stored in ProcessData, or can an attacker supply an invalid address that causes bind failures during start(), leaving safety rules unavailable? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Timeout configuration] Can network_timeout_ms be set to 0 or an extremely small value causing immediate timeouts, or to an extremely large value enabling DoS attacks by holding connections indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Storage backend security] Does safety_rules_manager::storage() properly validate that SecureBackend is not InMemoryStorage in production (mainnet), or can misconfiguration lead to volatile safety data that causes double-signing after node restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Consensus key loading] When safety_rules_manager::storage() loads consensus private keys from storage, are they protected against timing attacks or memory dumps that could leak validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::new()] [Waypoint validation] Does the storage initialization validate the waypoint from InitialSafetyRulesConfig, or can a forged waypoint be used to make safety rules accept blocks from a malicious fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Option unwrap panic] The start() method uses .expect() to unwrap self.data, but can an attacker call start() twice causing a panic on the second call, leading to validator crash and consensus liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Thread safety] Does Process::start() consume self properly, or can multiple threads call start() concurrently causing undefined behavior with the PersistentSafetyStorage being moved? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Remote service blocking] Does remote_service::execute() block forever in its infinite loop, and if Process is not running in a separate thread, can this block the entire validator node causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Error handling] When remote_service::execute() encounters storage errors (SafetyData read/write failures), does it panic or continue with stale data, potentially allowing safety rule violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Network binding failure] If remote_service::execute() fails to bind to server_addr (address already in use, permission denied), is the failure logged and does it panic, or does it silently fail leaving safety rules unreachable? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: Process::start()] [Storage corruption detection] If PersistentSafetyStorage is corrupted when passed to remote_service::execute(), can safety rules start with invalid SafetyData causing voting rule violations and consensus safety breaks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Struct: ProcessData] [Storage ownership] ProcessData takes ownership of PersistentSafetyStorage - if the storage contains cached SafetyData with enable_cached_safety_data=true, can stale cached data from a previous epoch cause safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Struct: ProcessData] [Network timeout overflow] The network_timeout field is u64 in Seconds - can integer overflow when converting from milliseconds in config cause incorrect timeout calculations, enabling DoS or timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Struct: ProcessData] [Address reuse] If ProcessData.server_addr is already bound by another process, does the safety rules service fail to start silently, or does it crash the validator? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Struct: ProcessService] [Client creation security] Does ProcessService.client() properly authenticate remote clients, or can any network peer connect to the safety rules service and send malicious vote/sign requests? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: ProcessService::new()] [Parameter validation] Does ProcessService::new() validate server_addr is a valid SocketAddr, or can an unresolvable address be passed causing panic during NetworkClient creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Function: ProcessService::new()] [Timeout bounds] Can network_timeout be 0 causing immediate connection failures, or MAX_U64 causing indefinite hangs during safety rules RPC calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Trait: RemoteService] [Address resolution] Does RemoteService.server_address() return SocketAddr directly or resolve it each time, and can DNS rebinding attacks redirect safety rules connections to malicious servers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Trait: RemoteService] [Client retry logic] The RemoteService.client() creates a NetworkClient - if connection fails, does it retry infinitely blocking consensus, or fail fast causing validator unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Remote communication] [Message authentication] When ProcessService connects to remote safety rules via NetworkClient, are messages authenticated to prevent MITM attacks injecting malicious votes or timeout certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Remote communication] [Message encryption] Does the network communication between ProcessService and remote safety rules use TLS/encryption, or can network-level attackers eavesdrop on signing operations revealing validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Remote communication] [Replay protection] If network messages between ProcessService and safety rules are captured, can they be replayed to cause duplicate votes or signature generation? (High)"
