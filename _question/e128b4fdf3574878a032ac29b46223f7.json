  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Deserialization bypass] Can an attacker craft malformed raw_message Bytes that deserialize into unexpected ConsensusMsg types, bypassing the Ack/Nack match guards? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Response type confusion] The method expects CommitMessage::Ack response but matches on ConsensusMsg - can an attacker wrap non-CommitMessage in ConsensusMsg causing type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Nack retry loop] When receiving Nack, the method bails with 'will retry' - can Byzantine validators force infinite retry loops by always sending Nack, causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Timeout bypass] Does the timeout_duration parameter enforce strict deadlines, or can slow validators delay responses just under timeout causing consensus slowdown attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Invalid response] When receiving non-Ack/Nack response, the method bails with 'Invalid response to request' - does this properly propagate errors or can it cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Raw bytes injection] Can an attacker manipulate raw_message Bytes to inject malicious payloads that exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in consensus_network_client.send_rpc_raw()? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc()] [Message type mismatch] Can an attacker send CommitVote/CommitDecision as message parameter but receive different message type in response, causing state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc()] [Ack validation] The method accepts Ack response without validating its contents - can an attacker send Ack(malicious_data) instead of Ack(()) to inject payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc()] [Timeout manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator respond with Ack just before timeout expires repeatedly, keeping connections open and exhausting validator resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc()] [Nack attack] Similar to send_rb_rpc_raw, can strategic Nack responses cause retry storms across multiple validators simultaneously amplifying consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::send_rb_rpc()] [Response boxing] The response is Box<CommitMessage> - can excessive boxing/unboxing cause memory fragmentation or heap exhaustion during high message volume? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization bomb] Can an attacker craft a CommitMessage with extremely large nested structures that cause exponential serialization time, creating a DoS attack? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol confusion] The method serializes by protocol for each peer - can mismatched protocol versions cause deserialization failures leading to dropped messages and liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Peer list manipulation] If the peers Vec contains duplicate or invalid Authors, can this cause partial broadcast failures or message duplication attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::to_bytes_by_protocol()] [HashMap corruption] The method returns HashMap<Author, Bytes> - can hash collision attacks cause some peers to receive incorrect serialized messages? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Memory exhaustion] When serializing for many peers simultaneously, can the HashMap accumulation cause OOM if CommitDecision contains large signature aggregations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency manipulation] Can Byzantine validators artificially inflate or deflate their reported latency to manipulate peer ordering and receive messages first/last? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::sort_peers_by_latency()] [Sorting instability] If peer latencies are equal, does the sort exhibit stable ordering or can non-deterministic sorting cause different validators to broadcast in different orders? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: RBNetworkSender::sort_peers_by_latency()] [Race condition] Can concurrent modifications to the peers slice during sorting cause undefined behavior or incorrect peer ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Cross-function: verify() + send_rb_rpc()] [TOCTOU race] Can an attacker pass verification when send_rb_rpc() is called but modify the message in-flight before it reaches the receiver, bypassing signature checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Cross-function: AckState + BroadcastStatus] [State synchronization] If AckState is shared across multiple broadcasts, can concurrent broadcasts corrupt the validators HashSet leading to incorrect ack aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Cross-function: send_rb_rpc() + add()] [Ack timing] If send_rb_rpc() completes before add() processes the response, can this race cause acks to be counted multiple times or dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Cross-function: verify() + epoch()] [Epoch validation bypass] Can an attacker send Vote with valid signature but mismatched epoch in ledger_info, where verify() passes but epoch() returns wrong value? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Cross-function: to_bytes_by_protocol() + send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Serialization mismatch] Can different protocol serialization produce non-deterministic bytes, causing signature verification to fail on receiver side? (High)",
