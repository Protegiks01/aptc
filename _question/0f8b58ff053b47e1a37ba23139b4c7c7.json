  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Protocol bypass] Does the vec![HealthCheckerRpc] at line 41 properly restrict the health checker to only use RPC protocol, or can direct send messages bypass health check validation logic? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Duration overflow] Can the combination of ping_interval_ms and ping_timeout_ms cause Duration arithmetic overflow in the health checker's timeout calculations, leading to immediate or infinite timeouts?

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Cascading failures] Can a health checker with aggressive settings (low ping_interval_ms, low ping_failures_tolerated) trigger cascading peer disconnections during network congestion, causing total loss of connectivity? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Asymmetric health checks] If different validators configure different ping_interval_ms values, can this create asymmetric health check patterns where some validators disconnect peers that others consider healthy, causing validator set inconsistencies?

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Invalid state recovery] If the HealthCheckNetworkInterface construction fails due to invalid network_rx or network_client, is the error properly propagated or does it result in a health checker that appears functional but doesn't work? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Config manipulation] Can an attacker with access to node configuration files set ping_failures_tolerated=u64::MAX-1 to effectively disable health checking, allowing Byzantine nodes to remain connected indefinitely?
