(High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/payload_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_payload()] [Payload validation] Does insert_block_payload() at line 79 validate the BlockPayload content before insertion, or can attackers insert payloads with malformed transactions, invalid signatures, or corrupted data?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/payload_store.rs] [Function: verify_payload_signatures()] [Signature completeness] Does verify_payload_signatures() at line 240 ensure all required signatures are present and valid, or can partial signature sets pass verification?
