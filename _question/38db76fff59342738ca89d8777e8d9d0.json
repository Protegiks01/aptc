  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Dependency Tracking] Does ReadWriteSummary properly support tracking multi-version dependencies in Block-STM, or can version confusion cause incorrect conflict detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Abort Handling] When a transaction aborts in Block-STM, is its ReadWriteSummary properly invalidated, or can stale summaries cause future transactions to see incorrect conflicts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Re-validation] During Block-STM re-validation phase, are ReadWriteSummary instances compared correctly to detect validation failures, or can false negatives allow invalid states to commit? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldID] [Predictability] Are DelayedFieldID values cryptographically unpredictable, or can attackers predict future IDs to front-run delayed field operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: Hash for InputOutputKey] [Collision Resistance] Is the hash function used by HashSet collision-resistant enough to prevent birthday attacks with feasible computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: Eq for InputOutputKey] [Constant-Time] Is the equality comparison constant-time to prevent timing side-channels that could leak information about accessed keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [False Conflict Griefing] Can an attacker create transactions with artificially inflated read/write sets that cause false conflicts with all other transactions, effectively DoS-ing parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Conflict Graph Cycles] Can circular dependencies in ReadWriteSummary conflict detection create deadlocks where no transaction can proceed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [Commutative Operations] For commutative operations (like increments), does conflict detection unnecessarily serialize them, and can this be exploited for performance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Phantom Reads] Can transactions experience phantom reads where the read set changes between validation and execution, violating snapshot isolation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Write Skew] Does the conflict detection prevent write skew anomalies where two transactions read the same data and write to different keys based on that read? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Speculative Execution] In speculative execution scenarios, can incorrect ReadWriteSummary predictions cause transactions to execute with stale data, creating exploitable race conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Transaction Replay] Can ReadWriteSummary be reused across block executions, and if so, can stale conflict information cause incorrect behavior in subsequent blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: find_conflicts()] [Conflict Resolution Order] Does the order in which conflicts are reported by find_conflicts() affect transaction execution order, and can this be manipulated by attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Partial Execution] Can partially executed transactions leave behind ReadWriteSummary entries that interfere with subsequent transaction scheduling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Version Visibility] In multi-version concurrency control, are different versions of the same key properly distinguished in ReadWriteSummary, or can version confusion cause conflicts to be missed? (Critical)"
