  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Feature flag poisoning] Can the init_features parameter at line 36 be set to enable experimental or unsafe features that cause consensus divergence between benchmark nodes and production nodes, invalidating benchmark results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Feature flag override bypass] Does the initial_features_override at line 85 completely replace the default features or merge with them, and can this cause critical safety features to be accidentally disabled in the benchmark environment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Storage config inconsistency] Is the storage_test_config parameter at line 33 properly validated against the enable_storage_sharding setting in bootstrap_with_genesis, or can mismatched configurations cause the database structure to be incompatible with the account creation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Empty path handling] Can db_dir be an empty string or '.' (current directory), and would this cause database files to be created in the current working directory, potentially mixing with source code or other important files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [StorageDirPaths validation] Does StorageDirPaths::from_path at line 100 properly validate the path structure, or can malformed paths cause RocksDB to create databases in incorrect subdirectory structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Relative vs absolute paths] If db_dir is a relative path, is it resolved consistently across all function calls (bootstrap_with_genesis, add_accounts_impl), or can working directory changes cause different functions to operate on different directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Genesis transaction validity] Is the genesis transaction returned by get_genesis_txn properly signed and formatted, or can it be manipulated to include invalid signatures that the benchmark accepts but production would reject? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Transaction execution bypass] Does generate_waypoint and maybe_bootstrap at lines 113-117 properly execute the genesis transaction through the VM, or can they bypass transaction validation allowing invalid state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Gas metering in genesis] Are gas costs properly metered during genesis transaction execution in bootstrap_with_genesis, or can unlimited gas consumption during initialization cause state bloat or DoS conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Atomic bootstrap failure] If waypoint generation succeeds at line 113-115 but maybe_bootstrap fails at line 116-117, does this leave the database in a partially initialized state with waypoint data but no genesis state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [State merkle corruption] Can interrupting the bootstrap process after line 109 (database open) but before line 117 (bootstrap complete) cause the state Merkle tree to be corrupted or inconsistent with the ledger? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: create_db_with_accounts()] [Transaction ordering] Does add_accounts_impl at line 64-75 guarantee that account creation transactions are applied in a deterministic order, or can non-deterministic ordering cause different benchmark runs to produce different state roots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Missing keyless config] If is_keyless is true in create_db_with_accounts but the keyless configuration (JWKs and Groth16 VK) at lines 86-92 is not properly set, can this cause keyless transactions in the benchmark to fail or behave inconsistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Issuer validation bypass] Does the sample issuer from get_sample_iss() at line 87 include proper validation logic, or can it accept any issuer value including malicious or production issuer identifiers?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Groth16 VK format] Is the Groth16VerificationKey::from conversion at lines 90-92 properly validated, or can malformed verification key data from TEST_GROTH16_SETUP cause the keyless verification to accept invalid proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Feature clone overhead] Does cloning init_features at lines 82 and 85 cause unnecessary memory allocation, and can providing extremely large or complex feature flag structures cause memory exhaustion during the clone operations?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/db_generator.rs] [Function: bootstrap_with_genesis()] [Test config in production database] If a database created by this benchmark utility is accidentally copied to a production environment, can the test configuration (sample JWKs, test Groth16 setup) at lines 84-92 create security vulnerabilities in production?
