  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_recursive_struct()] [Validation bypass] Can an attacker submit a malicious Move module marked as non-target (is_target() returns false) to bypass recursive struct validation entirely, allowing compilation of cyclic structs that could crash validators during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_recursive_struct()] [Module filtering] Does the is_target() check properly validate all dependency modules, or can an attacker place recursive structs in non-target dependency modules that get imported and crash the VM during instantiation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_recursive_struct()] [Concurrent access] If multiple threads call check_recursive_struct() on shared GlobalEnv, can race conditions in module iteration cause some structs to be skipped from validation, allowing recursive types through? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_recursive_struct()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker submit modules with thousands of struct definitions to cause O(n²) checking behavior that exhausts validator resources during compilation, leading to DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_recursive_struct()] [Module ordering] Does module iteration order affect validation completeness? Can attacker-controlled module ordering cause dependency checks to execute before dependencies are validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check()] [State corruption] The checked BTreeSet is local to check() but passed to recursive calls - can this cause validation state to be lost between different struct validations in the same module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check()] [Early termination] If check() encounters an error and the error reporting doesn't panic, does validation continue for remaining structs, potentially missing additional cycles that compound the vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check()] [Iterator exhaustion] Can malformed module environments cause get_structs() to return an invalid iterator that skips structs or causes infinite loops during iteration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check()] [Memory safety] If the checked set grows unboundedly with attacker-crafted struct graphs, can this cause OOM conditions before validation completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct()] [Race condition] The check 'if !checked.contains(&struct_id)' followed by recursive call is non-atomic - can concurrent validation of the same struct cause double-checking or missing validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct()] [Location spoofing] Can an attacker provide a fake struct_loc through crafted AST nodes to bypass location-based security checks or cause incorrect error reporting that hides the vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct()] [StructId collision] If attacker can cause StructId hash collisions or ID reuse, could this cause the wrong struct to be marked as checked, skipping validation of the actual recursive struct? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct()] [Empty path] The path Vec is initialized empty - can this cause the first struct in a cycle to never be properly validated since the cycle detection in check_struct_as_required_by needs non-empty paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct_as_required_by()] [Cycle detection bypass] The cycle check iterates path[i..] comparing ancestors - can an attacker craft a struct graph where struct IDs are manipulated to never match despite actual recursion existing?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/recursive_struct_checker.rs] [Function: check_struct_as_required_by()] [Path corruption] The path vector is mutated during iteration (push at 78, pop at 120) - can exceptions or early returns cause path corruption that breaks cycle detection? (High)",
