  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/diag.rs] [Function: diag()] [Chain ID Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate cluster.chain_id at line 19 to force transactions to be signed for a different chain, enabling cross-chain replay attacks that execute transactions on unintended networks?
