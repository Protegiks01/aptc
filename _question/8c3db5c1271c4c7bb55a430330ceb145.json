  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Zero-Length Message Handling] Can fuzzer data consist entirely of zero-length frames, and does the Peer properly handle sequences of empty messages without resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Maximum-Length Frame Attack] Can fuzzer data create messages at exactly MAX_FRAME_SIZE (4 MiB), testing boundary conditions in the frame codec that might cause buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Empty Corpus Generation] If proptest generates an empty vector (vec length 1..20 edge case), does generate_corpus() produce a valid corpus or corrupt output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [ReadOnlyTestSocketVec Empty Data] When fuzz() is called with empty data (&[]), does ReadOnlyTestSocketVec properly signal EOF immediately, or can this trigger undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Remote Peer ID Randomness] Does PeerId::random() use cryptographically secure randomness, or can predictable peer IDs be exploited for replay attacks or identity confusion? (Medium)"
