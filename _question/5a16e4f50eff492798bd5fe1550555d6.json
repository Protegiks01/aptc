  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Metadata store] If implementations write progress to different metadata stores or use different keys, can metadata become out of sync with actual pruned data causing repeated pruning attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Memory bounds] Can implementations accumulate unbounded data structures (e.g., transaction lists, event lists) when processing large version ranges, causing OOM kills on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [I/O amplification] Can implementations cause excessive disk I/O by reading and rewriting data unnecessarily during pruning, degrading validator performance during active consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Lock duration] Can implementations hold database locks for extended periods during large pruning operations, blocking other critical operations like transaction commitment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Compaction interference] Can pruning operations interfere with database compaction processes, causing write amplification or leaving tombstones that don't get cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Retention policy] Can implementations violate configured retention policies by either pruning too aggressively (data loss) or not pruning enough (storage bloat), affecting validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Latest state] Can implementations accidentally prune data that's part of the latest committed state (e.g., active accounts, validators), causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Version consistency] Can implementations prune versions out of order or skip versions, causing gaps in historical data that break state proof generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Foreign key integrity] Can implementations delete parent records (transactions) while leaving orphaned child records (events, write sets), violating referential integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Audit trail] Can implementations prune data required for audit logs or regulatory compliance before the required retention period, exposing validators to legal risk? (Medium)"
