  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause repeated to_file() calls with progressively larger error maps to exhaust validator disk space, causing write failures and potentially corrupting the error map file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorDescription] [String Memory Leaks] Are code_name and code_description strings properly freed when ErrorMapping is dropped, or can long-lived error maps cause memory leaks if strings are not deallocated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Clone Memory Cost] Does the .cloned() at line 79 create a deep copy that could be expensive for large ErrorDescription values, and can repeated calls cause memory pressure during transaction execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [BCS Version Skew] If the BCS format version changes between when to_file() serializes and from_file() deserializes, can this cause deserialization failures or data corruption, breaking error reporting after protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [BCS Malformed Data] Does bcs::from_bytes() at line 67 properly validate all fields of ErrorMapping, or can malformed BCS data cause fields to have invalid values (e.g., negative lengths, null pointers) leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [BCS Serialization Determinism] Is bcs::to_bytes() at line 71 guaranteed to produce byte-for-byte identical output for the same ErrorMapping on different validator nodes (different architectures, endianness), or can serialization differences cause file hash mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [BCS Integer Encoding] Does BCS properly handle u64 category_id and abort_code values at boundary conditions (0, u64::MAX), or can malformed encoding cause integer overflow/underflow during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [BCS String Encoding] Does BCS validate that code_name and code_description strings contain valid UTF-8, or can malformed strings cause panics or undefined behavior when accessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [BCS Nested Structure Limits] Does BCS impose limits on nesting depth or recursion, or can an attacker craft a BCS file with deeply nested BTreeMap structures that cause stack overflow during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [BCS Serialization Size Limit] If ErrorMapping grows to contain billions of entries, can bcs::to_bytes() handle serializing structures larger than isize::MAX bytes, or will it panic/fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_error_category()] [Error Propagation] When add_error_category() returns an error at lines 37-40, does the caller properly handle it, or can ignored errors cause partial error map initialization that breaks error reporting for critical system modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Error Propagation] When add_module_error() returns an error at lines 56-59, does this prevent the entire error map from being built, or can partial initialization leave the error map in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [No Error Recovery] If from_file() panics on any error at lines 66-67, does this prevent validators from starting if the error map file is corrupted, causing total loss of liveness until manual intervention? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [No Rollback on Failure] If to_file() panics at line 73 after partially writing, is there any rollback mechanism, or is the error map file left corrupted requiring manual recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Silent Failure] Does get_explanation() returning None at line 79 cause errors to be silently ignored, potentially masking critical consensus failures as 'unknown error' with no indication of what went wrong? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Default State] Does the Default implementation at line 22 create an empty ErrorMapping, and if used before error codes are registered, can this cause all error lookups to return None, completely breaking error diagnostics?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Module Upgrade Race] During a Move module upgrade, if old and new versions of a module register different error descriptions for the same abort_code, can this cause validators to report conflicting error messages for the same transaction, breaking consensus on error interpretation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Version Tracking] Does ErrorMapping track which version of each module its error codes correspond to, or if a module upgrades mid-epoch, can validators using old vs new error maps disagree on error meanings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Backwards Compatibility] If a module upgrade removes an error code that was previously registered, does the old error description remain in the map, potentially causing confusion when the same code is reused for a different error in the new version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Module Name Evolution] If a module is renamed during an upgrade (e.g., 'CoinV1' to 'CoinV2'), do error lookups fail because module_name doesn't match, causing all errors from the upgraded module to appear as 'unknown'?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [No Cleanup Mechanism] Is there any mechanism to remove old error codes when modules are deprecated or upgraded, or does the error map grow indefinitely, causing memory exhaustion over many epochs? (Low)",
