  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_mem_profiler()] [Type Erasure] Does type erasure to Box<dyn Profiler> hide important type information that could prevent compile-time safety checks for memory profiling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: CpuProfilerConfig::new_with_defaults()] [Hardcoded Paths] Are the default paths './profiling_results/' relative to current working directory, and can attackers control CWD to redirect profiling output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: MemProfilerConfig::new_with_defaults()] [Path Collision] Can the default txt_result_path and svg_result_path collide with existing validator files, causing data corruption when profiling is enabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ProfilerConfig] [Validation Missing] Does ProfilerConfig validate that cpu_profiler_config and mem_profiler_config are both not None simultaneously, or can empty configs cause runtime errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Struct: CpuProfilerConfig] [Frequency Range] Is there validation that frequency is within valid range (e.g., 1-1000 Hz), or can extreme values cause profiling overhead that degrades consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: memory_profiler.rs] [Platform Divergence] Does the #[cfg(not(unix))] stub implementation create security blind spots where memory issues go undetected on non-Unix validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: memory_profiler.rs] [Python Availability] What happens if python3 is not installed or is a malicious binary on the validator node - can this be exploited for code execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: memory_profiler.rs] [Script Permissions] Does jeprof.py require specific file permissions, and can permission issues cause profiling failures that mask security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ProfilerConfig] [Debug Trait] Does the Debug implementation for ProfilerConfig expose sensitive configuration details in logs that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Struct: CpuProfilerConfig] [Debug Output] Can Debug-printing CpuProfilerConfig leak filesystem paths or profiling parameters that reveal validator configuration to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: cpu_profiler.rs] [Atomic State] Is the transition from start_profiling() to end_profiling() atomic, or can interruptions leave profiling in an inconsistent state affecting validator operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: memory_profiler.rs] [Prof.active Consistency] Can failures between setting prof.active=true and prof.active=false leave jemalloc in an inconsistent state causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: end_profiling()] [Cleanup Guarantee] Does end_profiling() guarantee cleanup even if report generation fails, or can errors leave resources allocated indefinitely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Profiler] [Interface Contract] Does the Profiler trait document preconditions and invariants, or can implementers violate contracts causing security vulnerabilities in callers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Blocking Semantics] Is it documented that profile_for() blocks for duration_secs, or can unsuspecting callers cause consensus delays by profiling on critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: expose_svg_results()] [Error Semantics] Does expose_svg_results() clearly document that it may fail if profiling hasn't completed, or can callers misuse the API causing unexpected errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: expose_text_results()] [Format Validation] Does expose_text_results() validate text output format, or can malformed profiling data cause parsing errors or injection attacks in downstream consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: expose_svg_results()] [SVG Injection] Can malicious profiling data inject SVG script tags or external resource references that cause security issues when SVGs are rendered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: cpu_profiler.rs] [Flamegraph Format] Does the flamegraph SVG format include metadata that could be exploited for XSS or other injection attacks if served over HTTP? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: profiler] [Audit Logging] Are profiling session starts/stops logged with authentication details, or can unauthorized profiling occur without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_cpu_profiler()] [Usage Tracking] Is CPU profiler instantiation logged to detect potential DoS attempts through excessive profiling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_mem_profiler()] [Access Logging] Are memory profiler accesses logged given their ability to expose sensitive heap data? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: cpu_profiler.rs] [Regex Cache] Does the regex compilation in frames_post_processor() cache the compiled regex, or does it recompile on every frame causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/lib.rs] [Related: memory_profiler.rs] [Duplicate Profiling] Can multiple memory profiling sessions run concurrently, and if so, do they interfere with each other causing incorrect results? (Medium)"
