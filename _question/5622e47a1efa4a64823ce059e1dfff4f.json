  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_peer_request()] [Response Channel] Does response_sender.send() properly handle failures, or can a closed channel cause panics or dropped responses that desynchronize consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_peer_request()] [Issuer Creation] Can an attacker request observations for non-existent issuers to cause entry().or_default() to create empty state entries, polluting states_by_issuer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_peer_request()] [Epoch Validation] Does the function validate that the request is from the same epoch before responding, or can attackers from future/past epochs request observations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_peer_request()] [Finished State Exposure] When consensus_state is Finished, exposing my_proposal could reveal that this validator already has a quorum-certified update - can this information be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_peer_request()] [Error Propagation] When consensus_state is NotStarted and an error is returned, does this reveal timing information about when observations occur that could be exploited? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Version Mismatch] Can the update.update.version differ from what's expected based on local state, and if so, can this cause validators to accept outdated or future updates? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to process_quorum_certified_update for the same issuer cause multiple transitions to Finished state with different vtxn_guard values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Issuer Mismatch] Can update.update.issuer differ from the issuer in my_proposal, and if validation fails, does this properly abort the consensus session? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Epoch Boundary] If a QuorumCertifiedUpdate arrives after an epoch change but before reset_with_on_chain_state is called, can stale updates be accepted? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Counter Missing] The TODO comment indicates missing counters - can the lack of metrics prevent detection of consensus manipulation or performance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Struct: PerProviderState] [Default Values] Can the Default trait implementation create invalid states (all None/NotStarted) that violate invariants expected by other functions? (Medium)",
