  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: get_remaining_voting_power()] [Null Pointer/None Result] Does the function properly handle cases where stake_pool or proposal_id don't exist, or can missing values cause panics, unwrap failures, or return garbage data interpreted as valid voting power? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: get_remaining_voting_power()] [BCS Encoding Overflow] If the actual remaining voting power exceeds u64::MAX or contains invalid data, can BCS deserialization overflow, panic, or return incorrect values that enable voting with nonexistent power? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: get_remaining_voting_power()] [MemberId String Parsing] Does the MemberId::from_str parsing of '0x1::aptos_governance::get_remaining_voting_power' properly validate the function identifier, or can injection of malicious function names call unintended Move functions?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: get_remaining_voting_power()] [Empty Result Handling] If execute_view_function returns an empty values vector or None, does unwrapping cause panics, or can attackers exploit missing result handling to bypass voting power checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: get_remaining_voting_power()] [Return Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit type confusion if the Move function returns a different type than u64, causing deserialization to misinterpret bytes as inflated voting power values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: create_proposal_v2 & partial_vote] [Proposal-Vote Race Condition] Can an attacker create a proposal and immediately vote on it before other voters are aware, exploiting the lack of mandatory voting period delay to pass malicious proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: partial_vote & get_remaining_voting_power] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit time-of-check-time-of-use race condition by checking remaining voting power, then having someone else vote concurrently, allowing them to over-vote beyond actual power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: create_proposal_v2 & partial_vote] [Proposal Spam Attack] Can an attacker create unlimited proposals to flood the governance system, then vote on their own proposals to manipulate quorum calculations or prevent legitimate proposals from being noticed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: All] [Transaction Ordering Manipulation] Can an attacker control transaction ordering in the mempool to sequence create_proposal_v2, partial_vote, and other governance transactions in ways that exploit state transitions or voting windows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: All] [Account Reuse Vulnerability] If the same account is reused across create_proposal_v2 and partial_vote calls, can sequence number incrementing or account state changes create vulnerabilities that don't exist with separate accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Move Module Upgrade Exploit] Can an attacker create a proposal that upgrades the aptos_governance Move module itself, potentially introducing backdoors or removing security checks in future governance operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Move Resource Access Violation] Does the underlying aptos_stdlib::aptos_governance_partial_vote properly enforce Move's resource access controls, or can attackers directly manipulate voting state resources bypassing governance rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: All] [Move VM Gas Exploit] Can an attacker craft governance transactions that consume excessive gas during Move VM execution, causing validators to drop transactions or making governance operations prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: All] [Move Abort Code Manipulation] If Move functions abort with error codes, can attackers exploit improper error handling to cause governance state corruption or bypass security checks when aborts occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Move Script Execution] Does the execution_hash reference Move scripts/modules with unrestricted capabilities, or can attackers propose execution of scripts that access system resources, mint tokens, or manipulate chain state arbitrarily? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Vec<u8> Buffer Overflow] Can providing extremely large Vec<u8> parameters (execution_hash, metadata_location, metadata_hash) cause buffer overflows, memory corruption, or DoS when copied to Move VM or storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Functions: All] [AccountAddress Validation] Are AccountAddress parameters properly validated for format, length, and checksum, or can malformed addresses cause parsing errors, VM crashes, or incorrect address comparisons?
