  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Hash flooding] Can attackers send requests with tokens designed to cause hash collisions in the HashSet, degrading contains() performance to O(n)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Request flooding] Since token validation is lightweight, can attackers flood with invalid tokens faster than rate limiters can block them? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Memory pressure] If each failed check allocates a RejectionReason with the full token in the error message, can this cause memory pressure under high load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [File permissions] Does the code verify that the token file has appropriate permissions (not world-readable), or could tokens leak through file system access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [File tampering] Is there any integrity checking (like signatures or checksums) on the token file to detect unauthorized modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Symlink attack] Could attackers use symbolic links to point the token file to sensitive system files, causing the checker to accept arbitrary content as valid tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [String allocation] Does the token extraction allocate unnecessary strings, and could high request volumes cause memory fragmentation or OOM? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [String comparison] Is the contains() check using constant-time comparison for cryptographic tokens, or could timing attacks work even without the actual token? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Format string] The error message uses format!() with attacker-controlled token data - could this enable format string attacks or injection in downstream logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Error code] Does RejectionReasonCode::AuthTokenInvalid properly distinguish between missing tokens and invalid tokens for monitoring and security analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Multiple rejections] The function returns Vec<RejectionReason> but only ever adds one - could this lead to confusion if other code expects multiple reasons or none? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Reason processing] Are RejectionReasons properly sanitized before being returned to clients, or could sensitive information leak through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty token file] If the token file is empty (0 tokens loaded), does the checker reject all requests or fail to initialize properly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Null bytes] Can tokens or headers contain null bytes that terminate strings early, causing partial token matches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header absent] If both Authorization and X_IS_JWT_HEADER are missing, which rejection reason is returned, and is the order correct? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Unicode normalization] Are tokens compared using Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD), or could visually identical but byte-different tokens bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Control characters] Can control characters in tokens (like \\r, \\n, \\0) cause parsing issues or bypass validation through header splitting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Lifetime issues] Are the lifetimes of borrowed string slices from headers correct, or could they be invalidated before use causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Panic safety] If to_str(), split_whitespace(), or nth() panic, is there proper panic handling to prevent faucet crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Unwrap usage] Does the code use any .unwrap() or .expect() that could panic on invalid input causing service crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenChecker] [Send/Sync] Are the Send + Sync bounds from CheckerTrait properly satisfied, or could there be thread-safety issues with the manager field? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token entropy] Is there validation that tokens have sufficient entropy, or can attackers use weak tokens that are easily guessable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Constant-time comparison] Should token comparison be constant-time to prevent timing attacks, especially if tokens are cryptographic keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Token generation] Are there requirements on how tokens are generated to ensure they cannot be predicted or brute-forced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Config injection] Can attackers modify the ListManagerConfig at runtime to change the token file path to an attacker-controlled file? (Critical)"
