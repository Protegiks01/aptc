  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: get_all_checkpoint_indices()] [Early return exploitation] At line 192, when must_be_block is true, the function returns early - can this skip detection of internal checkpoints, allowing multi-checkpoint blocks that violate protocol assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: get_all_checkpoint_indices()] [Positions iterator bug] At lines 196-200, can the positions() iterator skip indices or return duplicates if transaction predicates change during iteration due to concurrent modification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: get_all_checkpoint_indices()] [Reconfig flag inconsistency] Can is_reconfig be true but all_checkpoint_indices be empty, or vice versa, causing state update logic to apply checkpoints incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: get_all_checkpoint_indices()] [Non-reconfig block ending bypass] Can transactions that return true for is_non_reconfig_block_ending() but shouldn't be checkpoints corrupt checkpoint detection and cause incomplete state commits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ensure_at_most_one_checkpoint()] [Checkpoint counting error] At lines 209-218, can the counting logic incorrectly count reconfig transactions, allowing multiple checkpoints to pass validation and violate single-checkpoint invariant? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ensure_at_most_one_checkpoint()] [Total overflow] Can the total variable at line 209 overflow if billions of checkpoint transactions are present, wrapping to small value and passing the <= 1 validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ensure_at_most_one_checkpoint()] [Validation timing] Is this function called before or after state commits? If after, can invalid multi-checkpoint blocks already corrupt state before validation fails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ensure_at_most_one_checkpoint()] [Error handling] At line 221, if the ensure! fails, does the error propagate correctly to prevent block commitment, or can it be swallowed leading to invalid state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ends_with_sole_checkpoint()] [Reconfig logic error] At lines 165-169, can the any() check for is_non_reconfig_block_ending miss edge cases where reconfig blocks have intermediate checkpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ends_with_sole_checkpoint()] [Position calculation error] At lines 171-174, can position() return None when there's actually a checkpoint, causing incorrect false return and breaking commit logic? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: ends_with_sole_checkpoint()] [Iterator exhaustion] Can calling this function multiple times on the same TransactionsToKeep exhaust or invalidate iterators, causing subsequent calls to return wrong results?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: make()] [Vector length validation bypass] Since make() calls new() which validates lengths, but index() is called after, can vectors be modified between construction and indexing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/transactions_with_output.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Empty state commits] At line 140, can empty TransactionsToKeep with version 0 be committed, creating spurious checkpoints or state updates that break version continuity? (Medium)",
