  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: open_internal] If get_synced_version() returns None during initialization, can this cause pruners to be initialized with incorrect target versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Struct: AptosDB] [Component Coupling] Multiple components (ledger_db, state_store, event_store, transaction_store) share the same database - can corruption in one component spread to others? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Struct: AptosDB] [RocksDB Property Reporter] The _rocksdb_property_reporter has underscore prefix indicating it's unused - can this cause resource leaks or does the Drop implementation handle cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: finalize_state_snapshot] Multiple restore_utils calls must execute atomically - if the process crashes midway, can this leave the database in an unrecoverable state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: finalize_state_snapshot] After state_store.reset(), are in-memory caches properly cleared, or can stale data persist causing validators to use outdated state? (High)"
