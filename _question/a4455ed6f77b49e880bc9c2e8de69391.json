  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [arb_secret_read_response] [Metadata consistency] Can metadata (created_time, version) be inconsistent with actual secret data, causing validators to trust outdated or tampered secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [arb_transit_read_key] [Timestamp rollback] Can creation_time timestamps be rolled back to cause key versioning confusion and force use of compromised historical keys? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [All arb_ functions] [Missing required fields] Does fuzzing test responses where required fields are missing, ensuring processing functions fail safely rather than using default values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [All arb_ functions] [Type mismatch fields] Can fields have incorrect types (e.g., string instead of number) that exploit lenient JSON parsing to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Test module] [Test isolation] Are proptest executions properly isolated, or can state pollution between test cases cause false negatives where vulnerabilities are masked? (Medium)",
