  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 45] [Replay Protector Overflow] If replay_protector uses sequence numbers, can integer overflow in sequence numbers cause duplicate detection to fail for transactions with wrapped-around sequence numbers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 47] [Sender Replay Pair] Is the (sender, replay_protector) pair sufficient for detecting all duplicates, or could transactions with identical content but different gas prices be incorrectly marked as non-duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper.rs] [Function: dedup() line 103] [Nonce Handling] The TODO comment mentions updating tests for nonce-based replay protection - are there unhandled edge cases in nonce deduplication that differ from sequence number behavior? (Medium)",
