  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::check()] [Rate Limit Bypass] Can an attacker bypass rate limiting by exploiting race conditions between the check() method returning rejection reasons and the actual state update in dry_run mode, allowing them to drain the faucet by making concurrent requests that all pass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::check()] [Authentication Bypass] Does the check() method properly validate that the dry_run flag cannot be manipulated by clients, or can attackers set dry_run=true to perform unlimited eligibility checks without triggering rate limit storage updates, allowing reconnaissance for timing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::check()] [Fund Drainage] Can an attacker exploit the return type Vec<RejectionReason> to cause the checker to return an empty vector for malicious requests by triggering error conditions that bypass validation logic, allowing unlimited token drainage from the faucet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::check()] [State Consistency] Is the CheckerData parameter properly validated before being passed to check(), or can attackers inject manipulated timestamp (time_request_received_secs) values to bypass time-based rate limiting and drain tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::check()] [Async Race Condition] Since check() is async, can multiple concurrent calls to check() for the same IP/user create a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) race condition where the limit is checked but multiple requests increment the counter simultaneously, allowing limit bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::complete()] [State Rollback Attack] Can an attacker exploit the default implementation of complete() which returns Ok(()) to prevent proper cleanup after failed funding attempts, causing rate limit counters to remain incremented even when funds weren't transferred, leading to denial of service for legitimate users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::complete()] [Double Completion] Is there protection against complete() being called multiple times for the same request, or can attackers trigger multiple completions to decrement rate limit counters below zero, allowing them to bypass limits and drain the faucet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::complete()] [500 Error Exploitation] Can an attacker deliberately trigger 500 errors by sending malformed requests after passing initial checks, causing complete() to roll back rate limits via response_is_500 flag, then immediately send valid requests to drain tokens without hitting limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::complete()] [Transaction Hash Manipulation] Does complete() validate the txn_hashes in CompleteData, or can attackers inject fake transaction hashes to manipulate audit logs while repeatedly draining the faucet through untracked requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::complete()] [Error Handling] If complete() returns an error, does the caller properly handle it, or can errors in cleanup logic leave the system in an inconsistent state where rate limits are not updated, allowing attackers to make unlimited requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::cost()] [Checker Ordering Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the cost() method's u8 return value to manipulate the order in which checkers run, ensuring expensive validators (like Redis) run after cheap ones fail, allowing them to bypass rate limiting by exploiting checker ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::cost()] [Priority Inversion] Does the system properly handle cases where a low-cost checker (cost=1-2) that should fail is executed after expensive checkers (cost=100), causing unnecessary resource consumption and potential DoS by forcing expensive Redis/database queries for requests that should be rejected immediately? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::cost()] [Cost Value Overflow] Since cost() returns u8, can creating a custom checker with cost=255 cause integer overflow issues when calculating total cost or sorting checkers, leading to incorrect execution order and security bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::spawn_periodic_tasks()] [Task Failure DoS] If a periodic task spawned by spawn_periodic_tasks() returns an error and exits, does this cause the entire faucet service to crash, or can attackers trigger conditions that cause task failures to achieve denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::spawn_periodic_tasks()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can malicious checker implementations spawn unbounded periodic tasks that consume all CPU/memory resources, since spawn_periodic_tasks() accepts a mutable JoinSet without apparent limits on the number of tasks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerTrait::spawn_periodic_tasks()] [Task Cancellation] If a checker's periodic tasks are not properly cancelled during shutdown, can resource leaks or zombie processes accumulate over time, eventually causing service degradation or crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker exploit the serde deserialization of CheckerConfig enum variants to inject malicious configurations, such as empty blocklists or disabled rate limits, by providing crafted configuration JSON/YAML at runtime? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Type Confusion] Does the #[serde(tag = \\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Missing Checkers] Can an attacker exploit a configuration with no checkers defined (empty Vec<CheckerConfig>) to completely bypass all security checks and drain the faucet without any rate limiting, authentication, or captcha validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Duplicate Checkers] Does the system prevent duplicate checker instances in the configuration, or can attackers cause the same checker to run multiple times, leading to double-increment of rate limits or incorrect rejection logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [Initialization Race] Is the async build() method properly synchronized when multiple configurations are built concurrently during startup, or can race conditions cause checkers to share mutable state incorrectly, leading to rate limit bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [CaptchaManager Sharing] Does build() properly validate that the Arc<Mutex<CaptchaManager>> is safely shared across all TapCaptchaChecker instances, or can concurrent access to the CaptchaManager cause captcha validation bypass through race conditions in the challenges HashMap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [Error Handling] If build() returns an error for one checker, does the system continue with other checkers or fail completely, and can attackers exploit partial initialization states to bypass security when some checkers fail to build? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [Resource Leak] Does build() properly clean up resources (Redis connections, file handles) if construction fails partway through, or can repeated failed build attempts exhaust system resources leading to DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [AuthToken Security] When building AuthTokenChecker, does the system validate that tokens are cryptographically strong, or can attackers predict valid auth tokens if weak tokens are loaded from configuration? (High)"
