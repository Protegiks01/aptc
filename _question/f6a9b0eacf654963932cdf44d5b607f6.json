  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Performance] If convert_svg_to_string() is called on very large SVG files during active consensus operations, can the blocking I/O cause validator performance degradation or timeout issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Resource Limit] Are there any timeouts or size limits enforced by the calling profiler code to prevent convert_svg_to_string() from reading indefinitely large files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Concurrency] If multiple threads concurrently call create_file_with_parents() with the same path, can race conditions cause file creation failures or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Concurrency] Are there any shared mutable state or global variables in the profiler system that could cause race conditions when these utilities are called from multiple threads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Thread Safety] Does fs::read_to_string() in convert_svg_to_string() properly handle interrupted system calls (EINTR) that could occur in concurrent environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Input Validation] Should convert_svg_to_string() validate that the file is actually an SVG with proper magic bytes or XML structure, or can any file type be read potentially exposing binary data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Input Validation] Does create_file_with_parents() validate path length limits to prevent buffer overflows or file system API issues on systems with path length restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Data Sanitization] If SVG file contents from convert_svg_to_string() are exposed through web APIs or dashboards, are they properly sanitized to prevent XSS attacks through malicious SVG content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Access Control] Is profiler functionality restricted to authorized operators, or can any process trigger file operations through these utilities causing security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Configuration] Are there configuration options to restrict the base directory for profiler file operations, preventing path traversal attacks through allowlist validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Configuration] Can profiler output paths be configured to use tmpfs or memory-based filesystems to prevent disk-based attacks and improve security? (Low)"
