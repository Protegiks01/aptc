  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: prefetch_wait] [Cache Poisoning] Can attackers manipulate prefetching behavior to maximize prefetch_wait times, and does this metric help detect when prefetching is being systematically defeated by adversarial transaction patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: non_prefetch_kv] [Cache Bypass] Can malicious transaction senders craft transactions that intentionally bypass the prefetch mechanism to maximize non_prefetch_kv counts and degrade execution performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metrics: prefetch_kv vs non_prefetch_kv] [Performance Attack] If the ratio of non_prefetch_kv to prefetch_kv becomes skewed, does this indicate a successful attack to defeat the prefetching optimization, and are there alerting thresholds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Registration] [Double Registration] Can the register_histogram_vec! and register_int_counter_vec! macros be called multiple times for the same metric names, causing registration panics or metric data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Unwrap] [Panic on Failure] Do the .unwrap() calls on lines 30 and 45 properly handle all failure cases from metric registration, or can unexpected failures (e.g., invalid bucket configuration) cause validator crashes during startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Lazy Initialization] [Startup Timing] Can delays in lazy initialization of these metrics during high transaction load cause metrics to be unavailable during critical execution periods, hiding performance degradation or attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Label: shard_id] [Shard Manipulation] Can malicious actors control or predict shard_id values to target specific shards with coordinated attacks, using the metrics to identify the most vulnerable or heavily loaded shards? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: init_prefetch] [Prefetch Initialization] Can attackers trigger scenarios where init_prefetch takes excessive time by requesting state values that are expensive to locate or compute, causing executor delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: kv_responses] [Response Flooding] Can malicious shards flood the executor with excessive kv_responses that cause memory exhaustion or processing delays, tracked but not prevented by the counter metric? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Remote KV] [Network Timing] Do the timing metrics for remote KV operations include network latency, and can attackers exploit this by introducing artificial network delays to skew performance measurements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: kv_resp_ser] [Serialization Bomb] Can the system be attacked with state values that serialize to extremely large byte arrays, causing kv_resp_ser timing to spike and potentially exhausting network bandwidth or memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/metrics.rs] [BCS Serialization] [Format Attack] Does the BCS serialization tracked by kv_resp_ser have bounds on output size, or can malicious state values cause unbounded serialization output? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
