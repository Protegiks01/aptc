  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Async cancellation safety] If a client disconnects mid-request while dumping large consensus DBs or blocks, are resources properly cleaned up, or do partial results remain in memory causing leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::start()] [make_service_fn closure capture] Does the make_service_fn closure properly capture and clone the context Arc, or can reference counting issues cause the Context to be dropped while requests are still being processed?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::start()] [Server.await error handling] If Server.await returns an error (e.g., TCP listener fails), is the error properly propagated, or does the admin service silently stop accepting connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Missing rate limiting] Does the admin service implement any rate limiting on authenticated requests, or can an authenticated attacker flood the service with thousands of DB dump requests per second? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Missing request size limits] Are there limits on the size of query parameters, or can an attacker send gigabyte-sized query strings that consume excessive memory parsing URL parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Missing timeout enforcement] Do admin requests have timeouts, or can long-running operations like dumping large consensus DBs run indefinitely, exhausting server resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [CORS and origin checking] Does the admin service validate request origins, or can cross-site requests from malicious web pages in validators' browsers access admin endpoints? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Read lock upgrade vulnerability] Can multiple threads holding read locks on Context's RwLocks cause deadlock if any thread tries to acquire a write lock for updating database references? (Medium)",
