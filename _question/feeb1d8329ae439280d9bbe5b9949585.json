(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker specify an arbitrarily large `num_modules` parameter (line 31) in combination with a high `count` value to cause the publish_package call (line 43-52) to consume excessive resources and cause validator node memory exhaustion? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Privilege escalation] Does the root_account parameter (lines 29, 45, 72) have proper access control validation, or can malicious benchmark code gain unauthorized access to root account privileges through this workflow?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Package name collision] Can the package_name() method (line 49) return a non-unique name that causes package publishing to overwrite existing modules, potentially corrupting test state or enabling unauthorized module replacement?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to construct_workflow() cause race conditions in the publish_package await (line 43-52) where multiple threads attempt to publish to the same account addresses simultaneously?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Worker ordering attack] Can the ordering of workers in the Vec (lines 55-62) be manipulated so that burn_entry_point executes before mint_entry_point, causing burn operations to fail and creating workflow deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Worker type confusion] Are the Box<dyn UserModuleTransactionGenerator> workers (lines 55-62) properly type-checked, or can an attacker inject a worker that violates the expected EntryPointTransactionGenerator contract?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Arc reference leak] Can the Arc::new wrapper on line 42-53 create reference cycles that prevent proper cleanup of published packages, leading to memory leaks in long-running benchmarks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [None parameter handling] What happens when loop_last_num_times is None (line 68) - does this cause the workflow to never terminate, potentially creating an infinite loop in benchmark execution?
