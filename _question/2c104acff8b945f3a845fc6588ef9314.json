  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can the LogSchema struct inadvertently log sensitive peer monitoring request data (network addresses, peer IDs, node information) that could be harvested by attackers with log access to map network topology and identify validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Privacy Violation] Does the 'request' field logging expose internal client state strings from PeerMonitoringMetadata that may contain sensitive debugging information about validator performance or network conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Leakage] Can error messages logged through the 'error' field expose internal implementation details (storage paths, version numbers, internal error codes) that aid attackers in crafting targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Network Reconnaissance] Does logging NetworkInformationResponse data through the 'response' field reveal the complete list of connected peers and their roles, enabling attackers to identify and target validator nodes specifically? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Timing Attack] Can the logging of NodeInformationResponse containing highest_synced_version and ledger_timestamp_usecs enable timing analysis to determine when specific transactions are processed by validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Injection] Can malicious peers send crafted PeerMonitoringServiceRequest with embedded newline characters or ANSI escape sequences in request data that corrupt log files or inject fake log entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: message] [Log Injection] Does the optional 'message' field properly sanitize user-controlled strings before logging, or can attackers inject malicious content that breaks log parsing or corrupts SIEM systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: response] [Format String] If the 'response' field uses Debug formatting on PeerMonitoringServiceResponse, can specially crafted responses with format string specifiers cause crashes or information disclosure during log serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Log Manipulation] Can attackers exploit the snake_case serialization of LogEntry variants to inject fake log entries that appear legitimate but have manipulated entry types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Derive: Schema] [Serialization Bug] Does the Schema derive macro properly handle all edge cases when serializing LogSchema with Option fields, or can None values cause panics or unexpected behavior in logging infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization DoS] Can malicious peers send deeply nested or extremely large PeerMonitoringServiceRequest objects that cause excessive CPU usage during log serialization, leading to validator performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: request] [Deserialization Attack] If logged request data is later deserialized for analysis, can crafted LatencyPingRequest with extreme ping_counter values trigger integer overflow or unsafe operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Memory Exhaustion] Can attackers trigger unbounded log growth by sending repeated requests with large response payloads (e.g., NetworkInformationResponse with thousands of connected peers), causing disk exhaustion and node failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: error] [Reference Lifetime] Does the 'error: Option<&'a Error>' field properly handle lifetime constraints, or can dangling references occur if Error objects are dropped before logs are flushed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: message] [String Allocation] Can repeated logging of large message strings cause memory fragmentation or excessive allocation pressure on validator nodes during high request volumes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Method: new()] [Resource Leak] Does the new() constructor properly initialize all Option fields to None, or can uninitialized memory be leaked through logs if fields are accessed before being set? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Authentication Context] Does LogSchema log the identity/peer_id of the requester making peer monitoring requests, or can malicious actors perform reconnaissance without leaving an audit trail linking back to their node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Insufficient Audit Logging] Does the LogEntry enum distinguish between successful and failed authentication attempts for peer monitoring requests, or can brute force attacks go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Authorization Bypass] Are authorization failures (e.g., non-validator requesting validator-only information) logged distinctly through LogEntry::PeerMonitoringServiceError, or can access control violations be hidden in generic error logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: request] [Request Validation] When logging PeerMonitoringServiceRequest, does LogSchema validate that the request enum variant matches expected patterns, or can type confusion attacks pass through logging without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: response] [Response Tampering Detection] Does logging of responses include cryptographic hashes or checksums to detect if responses are tampered with between generation and network transmission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::ReceivedPeerMonitoringRequest] [Rate Limiting Bypass] Are received request logs used for rate limiting decisions, and if so, can attackers manipulate log timestamps or request counts to bypass rate limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::SentPeerMonitoringResponse] [Response Replay Detection] Do sent response logs include monotonic counters or nonces to detect replay attacks, or can attackers replay old responses without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Race Condition] If multiple threads concurrently create LogSchema instances for the same request, can race conditions cause logs to be written out of order or with incorrect correlation IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: error] [Thread Safety] Since LogSchema holds references to Error objects, can concurrent logging from multiple request handlers cause data races if Error references are shared across threads unsafely? (Medium)"
