  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: maybe_set_pruner_target_db_version()] [Equality edge case] When latest_version exactly equals min_readable_version + pruning_batch_size + prune_window, does the >= comparison trigger pruning immediately, and is this the intended behavior or should there be additional margin? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: set_pruner_target_db_version()] [Zero version] Can latest_version of 0 be passed to set_pruner_target_db_version() during genesis, and does saturating_sub correctly handle this to avoid pruning genesis state which should always be accessible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Crash recovery] If the validator crashes while save_min_readable_version() is writing to disk, can the database be left in a state where pruner progress is partially written, causing get_state_kv_pruner_progress() to return corrupted data on restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: save_min_readable_version()] [Idempotence] Is save_min_readable_version() idempotent, or can calling it multiple times with the same version cause side effects like duplicate metric updates or redundant disk writes that waste resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: maybe_set_pruner_target_db_version()] [Spin loop] Can an attacker cause latest_version to hover just below the pruning threshold, causing maybe_set_pruner_target_db_version() to be called repeatedly without triggering pruning, wasting CPU cycles on threshold checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: save_min_readable_version()] [Lock contention] If save_min_readable_version() is called from multiple threads, can this cause lock contention on the underlying state_kv_db, degrading validator performance during high pruning activity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: set_pruner_target_db_version()] [Epoch boundaries] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can pruning continue safely or can rapid min_readable_version updates interfere with state sync operations needed for new validators to join? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: maybe_set_pruner_target_db_version()] [State sync race] If a validator is performing state sync while maybe_set_pruner_target_db_version() triggers pruning, can this cause a race where historical state being synced is pruned before sync completes, causing sync to fail and preventing the validator from catching up? (Critical)"
