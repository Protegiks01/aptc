  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountPublicKey::to_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the different serialization formats between Ed25519 and AnyPublicKey variants to create collision attacks where two different keys produce identical byte representations, allowing unauthorized access to accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountPublicKey::as_ed25519()] [Key type downgrade] When converting AnyPublicKey to Ed25519, can an attacker provide a Keyless or FederatedKeyless public key that gets incorrectly treated as Ed25519, bypassing keyless authentication requirements and stealing funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountPublicKey::as_keyless()] [Authentication bypass] Does the keyless extraction logic properly validate the inner public key structure, or can malformed AnyPublicKey variants bypass keyless validation checks allowing unauthorized transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: AccountPublicKey] [Enum variant mismatch] Can an attacker construct an AccountPublicKey where the enum variant doesn't match the actual key type stored inside, causing signature verification to succeed with wrong key material and enabling transaction forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [Weak randomness] Does the KeyGen::from_os_rng() provide cryptographically secure randomness, or can predictable RNG state allow attackers to pre-compute private keys and steal funds from newly created accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_from_seed()] [Seed reuse] If the same KeyGen seed is reused across multiple Account::new_from_seed() calls, can attackers predict subsequent private keys and compromise accounts created later in the sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_from_addr()] [Keypair mismatch] The function accepts arbitrary addr and pubkey without verification - can attackers create Account instances where address doesn't match the public key hash, causing state inconsistencies when transactions are validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_from_addr()] [Dummy private key] Since this creates a dummy private key, can attackers exploit scenarios where the dummy key accidentally matches real account keys through collision, allowing unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::with_keypair()] [Address derivation] Does aptos_types::account_address::from_public_key() use a collision-resistant hash function, or can attackers find different public keys that hash to the same address, enabling account takeover? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_validator()] [Validator impersonation] Can attackers call new_validator() with an arbitrary address and keypair to impersonate existing validators in test environments that propagate to production, compromising consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_genesis_account()] [Genesis keypair exposure] The GENESIS_KEYPAIR is shared across all genesis accounts - can attackers use this to sign unauthorized transactions on behalf of any genesis account, draining protocol-owned funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::new_aptos_root()] [Root account compromise] Does using the shared GENESIS_KEYPAIR for the aptos root account allow attackers to execute privileged operations like minting unlimited coins or modifying system configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::address()] [Address immutability] While comments claim address doesn't change after key rotation, can implementation bugs cause address to update, breaking transaction replay protection and enabling double-spending? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::make_account_access_path()] [Resource path manipulation] Can attackers exploit the expect() call to cause panics in production code, or manipulate the AccessPath to point to wrong account resources causing state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::make_coin_store_access_path()] [Type parameter injection] Can attackers substitute AptosCoinType with a malicious type parameter to access wrong CoinStore resources, enabling theft of different token types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::rotate_key()] [Key rotation race condition] If rotate_key() is called concurrently with transaction signing, can the new key be used before auth_key is updated on-chain, causing transaction validation failures or signature bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::rotate_key()] [Old key retention] After rotation, is the old private key securely wiped from memory, or can it remain accessible allowing attackers to sign transactions with revoked keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::auth_key()] [Authentication key collision] Can different public keys (Ed25519 vs AnyPublicKey) produce identical authentication keys, allowing attackers to control accounts they shouldn't have access to? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: Account::auth_key()] [Keyless auth key derivation] For keyless accounts, does AuthenticationKey::any_key() properly encode all keyless-specific fields (iss, aud, uid_key), or can attackers create colliding auth keys for different keyless identities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: TransactionBuilder] [Uninitialized fields] Can attackers call raw() before setting required fields like sequence_number or program, causing panics via expect() that could DoS transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::new()] [Sender clone] The sender Account is cloned - can this lead to confusion where modifications to the original don't reflect in the builder, causing signature mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::secondary_signers()] [Signer order manipulation] Can attackers reorder secondary_signers to change the transaction hash, bypassing signature verification or executing unauthorized multi-sig operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::secondary_signers()] [Duplicate signers] If secondary_signers contains duplicates or includes the primary sender, can this bypass signature checks or cause double-counting in multi-sig validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::fee_payer()] [Fee payer replacement attack] Can attackers replace the fee_payer after transaction construction but before signing, causing the wrong account to pay fees or enabling fee theft?
