  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Error Masking] Can a sophisticated attacker trigger UnexpectedErrorEncountered errors that mask underlying IntegerOverflow or AptosDataClientResponseIsInvalid errors, preventing proper security response and allowing the attack to continue undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Thread Safety] [Arc Error Sharing] When errors are shared across threads via Arc<Error>, could race conditions in error inspection cause incorrect error handling decisions if one thread modifies the error (through interior mutability) while another thread is reading it? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Thread Safety] [Channel Error Propagation] When SendError and Canceled are converted to Error via From traits, does this happen synchronously in the sender thread, and could timing differences in error propagation across channels cause non-deterministic error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Attack Detection Bypass] Since get_label() at lines 29-39 returns coarse-grained labels like 'data_is_unavailable', can attackers hide their attack patterns by triggering different attack vectors that all map to the same label, making it impossible to distinguish between legitimate network issues and coordinated attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Alert Fatigue] Can Byzantine validators deliberately trigger high volumes of benign errors (like NoDataToFetch) to increase the baseline error rate, causing operators to raise alert thresholds and miss critical IntegerOverflow or AptosDataClientResponseIsInvalid errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Metric Cardinality] Does the static label approach prevent adding important dimensions to metrics (like peer_id, data_range, error_source) that would be needed to identify which specific validator is sending malicious responses? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Derive: Error, Debug] [Debug Information Leakage] Since Error derives Debug at line 9, could the Debug output in production logs expose sensitive information about internal state, version numbers, or peer identities that should not be visible to operators or log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Macro: #[error(...)]] [Display Format Injection] The thiserror error messages at lines 11-24 directly include the String parameter via '{0}' formatting - could malicious content in these strings cause issues when errors are displayed in terminal output (e.g., ANSI escape sequence injection)? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Trait: From<aptos_data_client::error::Error>] [Error Type Collapse] When converting from aptos_data_client::error::Error to streaming service Error via the From trait at lines 42-46, does collapsing different client error types into a single AptosDataClientError variant lose important security context about whether the error was due to network issues, peer malice, or data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Trait: From<aptos_data_client::error::Error>] [Peer Ban Evasion] If the aptos_data_client returns specific error types for malicious peers (e.g., InvalidResponse), but these get converted to generic AptosDataClientError strings, does this prevent the streaming service from properly identifying and banning malicious peers? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Trait: From<aptos_data_client::error::Error>] [Error Chain Loss] Does the to_string() conversion at line 44 lose the error chain from the original aptos_data_client error, making it impossible to debug whether the root cause was a peer sending malicious data or a transient network issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Critical Path: Epoch Transitions] [Epoch Boundary Errors] During epoch transitions, if IntegerOverflow or DataIsUnavailable errors occur when fetching epoch-ending ledger infos, could this prevent validators from learning about the new validator set, causing them to be permanently stuck at the old epoch and unable to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Critical Path: State Snapshot] [Snapshot Corruption] When streaming state snapshots for fast sync, if AptosDataClientResponseIsInvalid errors occur partway through the snapshot, does the error handling properly abort and rollback the partial state, or could corrupted state be committed to storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/error.rs] [Critical Path: Continuous Sync] [Liveness Impact] For continuously syncing validators in production, if repeated errors cause the streaming service to fall behind by more than the pruning window, could this cause permanent inability to sync (requiring snapshot restoration), effectively ejecting the validator from the network? (Critical)"
