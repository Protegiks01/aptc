  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Consensus manipulation] Can a malicious validator manipulate the exclude_transactions BTreeMap to cause honest validators to select different transaction sets, leading to consensus disagreement and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Integer overflow] In the sequence number arithmetic at line 464 where txn_seq - 1 is calculated, can an attacker submit a transaction with sequence number 0 to cause integer underflow, bypassing the txn_was_chosen() check and enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Logic error] Can an attacker exploit the skipped HashSet logic (lines 446-498) by submitting transactions with strategic sequence number gaps to cause legitimate transactions to be permanently skipped, resulting in liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Race condition] Are concurrent calls to get_batch() from multiple consensus threads safe, or can race conditions in accessing the shared transactions TransactionStore lead to duplicate transaction inclusion across different blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Consensus bypass] Can an attacker craft transactions that pass the exclude_transactions.contains_key() check at line 455 but are actually already in consensus, exploiting hash collision or TxnPointer comparison logic to cause duplicate execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [DoS attack] Can an attacker fill the skipped HashSet (line 446) with millions of entries by submitting transactions with non-sequential sequence numbers, causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Transaction ordering] In the priority queue iteration at line 450, can an attacker manipulate gas prices to ensure their malicious transactions are always selected first, starving legitimate user transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Integer overflow] At line 494 where skipped_txn_seq_num += 1 is incremented, can this overflow if an attacker submits transactions with sequence numbers near u64::MAX, causing infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Logic bypass] Does the account_sequence_number comparison at line 472 correctly handle cases where account state changes between mempool insertion and get_batch() call, potentially allowing out-of-order execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [State inconsistency] Can the inserted HashSet (line 435) become inconsistent with the actual result vector if exceptions occur during iteration, causing validators to have different views of selected transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Byte calculation error] At line 521, the txn_size calculation uses txn_bytes_len() - can this be manipulated to undercount transaction sizes, allowing blocks to exceed max_bytes and cause consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Nonce replay] For ReplayProtector::Nonce transactions at line 500-506, are there any checks preventing the same nonce from being selected multiple times across different get_batch() calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Logic error] Can the break statement at line 492 inside the while loop cause skipped transactions to be permanently lost if max_txns is reached exactly when processing skipped entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Transaction exclusion] Does the range search in exclude_transactions (lines 412-415) correctly handle all edge cases with TxnPointer ordering, or can transactions slip through and be double-included? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Consensus split] If return_non_full is false and the block is cleared at line 577, can this cause validators to propose empty blocks while others propose full blocks, leading to consensus disagreement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/mempool.rs] [Function: get_batch()] [Memory leak] Is the skipped HashSet properly cleared after each get_batch() call, or can it grow unbounded across multiple calls leading to memory exhaustion? (High)",
