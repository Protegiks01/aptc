  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [Function: dial (line 83-85)] [Outbound future safety] Does the returned Outbound future properly enforce connection timeouts, or can hanging connections exhaust node resources affecting validator availability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [General] [Panic safety] Do all functions properly handle panics through catch_unwind, or can panics in boxed futures corrupt validator state and cause consensus inconsistencies? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [General] [Resource cleanup] Do boxed futures properly clean up resources (sockets, buffers) on drop, or can resource leaks accumulate causing validator nodes to run out of file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [Integration] [Noise protocol bypass] Can the boxing abstraction be exploited to bypass Noise encryption when BoxedTransport wraps an unencrypted transport, allowing plaintext consensus messages? (Critical)",
