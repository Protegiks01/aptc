  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]>] [Deserialization vulnerability] Can an attacker craft malformed byte arrays that bypass validation in the TryFrom implementation (lines 54-60), causing the underlying DealtSecretKey::try_from to accept invalid group elements that could compromise the PVSS reconstruction algorithm? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]>] [Point validation bypass] Does the TryFrom implementation properly validate that deserialized G1Projective points lie on the BLS12-381 curve and are in the correct subgroup, or can an attacker inject invalid points that break the Lagrange interpolation in secret reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Constant size assumption] The to_bytes() method (line 32-34) returns a fixed-size array - can this assumption be violated if DEALT_SK_NUM_BYTES is misconfigured, leading to truncation or buffer overflow in serialization contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Canonicalization bypass] Does to_bytes() enforce canonical encoding of the group element, or can the same secret share be represented in multiple ways, enabling double-decryption attacks in the PVSS protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Empty AIP-80 prefix vulnerability] The ValidCryptoMaterial trait implementation (lines 41-46) uses an empty AIP_80_PREFIX - could this allow for type confusion attacks where DealtSecretKeyShare bytes are misinterpreted as other cryptographic material types in the Aptos protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]>] [Length validation bypass] Can an attacker provide byte slices of incorrect length to TryFrom that pass through to DealtSecretKey::try_from without proper bounds checking, potentially causing panics or memory unsafety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Vector allocation DoS] The ValidCryptoMaterial::to_bytes() wrapper (line 43-45) converts the fixed array to Vec - could repeated calls in verification contexts cause excessive memory allocations enabling DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Group element exposure] The as_group_element() method (lines 36-38) returns a reference to the internal G1Projective - can an attacker who gains read access to this element recover the underlying secret share scalar through timing side-channels or other attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Identity element attack] Can an attacker create a DealtSecretKeyShare wrapping the identity element of G1, causing the Lagrange reconstruction to produce a predictable or zero secret key that breaks VUF security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: new()] [Small subgroup attack] Does the new() constructor (lines 28-30) validate that the dealt_sk parameter is not in a small subgroup of G1, which could allow an attacker to compromise the discrete log problem's hardness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Rogue key attack] Can a malicious dealer create DealtSecretKeyShare instances with specially crafted group elements that, when combined during threshold reconstruction, cancel out honest players' contributions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Pairing vulnerability] Since the underlying group element is exposed via as_group_element(), can an attacker use this in invalid pairing equations to forge shares or break the PVSS proof system? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Compressed point attacks] The serialization uses compressed point representation - can an attacker exploit decompression ambiguity to create shares that appear valid but reconstruct to incorrect secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Clone safety violation] The struct derives Clone (line 17) but has a feature flag assert-private-keys-not-cloneable (lines 20-21) - if the feature is disabled in production, can memory duplication of secret shares enable key extraction or double-use attacks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Timing side-channel] The PartialEq implementation (line 17) likely uses constant-time comparison - if not, can timing attacks on share equality checks leak information about the secret scalar values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Derive: SilentDebug] [Debug information leak] The SilentDebug derive (line 10) is meant to prevent logging - is this properly enforced, or can debug builds leak secret share values through trace logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Derive: SilentDisplay] [Display information leak] Similar to SilentDebug, does SilentDisplay completely prevent string representation of secret shares, or can format string attacks extract the underlying group element? (Medium)",
