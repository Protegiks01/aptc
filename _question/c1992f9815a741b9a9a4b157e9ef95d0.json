  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Silent bind failure] Do the bind() calls at lines 41 and 47 properly propagate errors, or can bind failures be silently ignored causing validators to run without functional APIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [No graceful shutdown] Does serve() implement graceful shutdown handling, or will abrupt termination cause in-flight API requests to fail corrupting client state or causing validator reputation damage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [TLS handshake errors] Are TLS handshake failures properly logged and handled, or can they cause silent connection drops making debugging validator connectivity issues impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: from()] [Unvalidated ApiConfig] The From<ApiConfig> implementation at lines 16-19 blindly trusts ApiConfig values - can malicious configuration cause invalid SocketAddr or path injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: new()] [No path canonicalization] Do tls_cert_path and tls_key_path get canonicalized in the constructor at lines 23-32, or can relative paths cause ambiguity in multi-process deployments leading to wrong certificate loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Struct: WebServer] [No validation in constructor] The new() function at lines 23-32 performs no validation - can invalid SocketAddr values like SocketAddr::from(([256,0,0,0], 0)) cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Struct: WebServer] [Public field mutation] The address, tls_cert_path, and tls_key_path fields at lines 11-13 are public - can external code mutate these after construction but before serve() causing inconsistent server configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing TLS consistency check] If only one of tls_cert_path or tls_key_path is Some, should this be rejected in the constructor rather than causing a panic later in serve()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Non-thread-safe routes] The routes parameter requires Send + Sync at line 37 - but are the underlying handlers truly thread-safe, or can race conditions in route handlers corrupt validator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Multiple serve() invocations] Can serve() be called multiple times concurrently on the same WebServer instance, and if so, does this create race conditions in warp's internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Async cancellation safety] If the Future returned by serve() is dropped before completion, are resources properly cleaned up or can this leak file descriptors and sockets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Task spawning] Does warp::serve spawn unbounded tasks for each connection, or is there a task limit to prevent resource exhaustion under load? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [No security logging] Does the WebServer log security-relevant events like TLS handshake failures, bind errors, or certificate validation failures for incident response? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Dependency: warp] [Warp framework vulnerabilities] Does the warp dependency have known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) that could be exploited through the WebServer wrapper to compromise validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Hyper HTTP vulnerabilities] Since warp uses hyper internally, are there HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 parsing vulnerabilities that could cause request smuggling or response splitting attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Tokio runtime assumptions] Does serve() assume a specific tokio runtime configuration, and can misconfigurations cause panics or deadlocks in validator nodes? (Medium)",
