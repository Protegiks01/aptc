  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Constants: EMPLOYEE_VESTING_ACCOUNTS_FILE] [Vesting Attack] Can vesting schedules be manipulated to grant immediate access to locked tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Layout validation] [Validator Count Attack] Can the layout allow fewer than minimum required validators, breaking Byzantine fault tolerance assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client operations] [Configuration Inconsistency] Can validators end up with different genesis configurations due to race conditions or timing issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: SetupGit] [Replay Genesis] Can old genesis configurations be replayed to reset the chain state or revert to vulnerable framework versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client::put()] [Configuration Overwrite] Can an attacker overwrite critical genesis files after legitimate setup but before genesis execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client::get()] [Empty File Handling] Can empty or zero-byte files cause panics or undefined behavior during deserialization? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/git.rs] [Function: Client::get_framework()] [Missing Framework] What happens if framework.mrb is missing - can this be exploited to use a default or attacker-provided framework? (Critical)",
