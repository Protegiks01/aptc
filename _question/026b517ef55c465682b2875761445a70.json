  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a Desc with variable_labels.len() that overflows when compared to label_values.len(), bypassing the validation check at line 29 and causing out-of-bounds access in label_pairs()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Memory Safety] Can an attacker pass extremely large label_values arrays that cause excessive memory allocation at line 28 when unwrap_or_default() creates empty default slice, potentially exhausting validator node memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Logic Error] Does the label validation at lines 29-31 properly handle the case where desc.variable_labels contains duplicate label names, allowing attackers to create ambiguous metrics that hide consensus failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Information Disclosure] Can malicious validators inject sensitive information (private keys, internal state) into counter values at line 36, which then get exposed through Prometheus endpoints, leaking critical validator data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Type Confusion] If label_pairs() returns labels in unexpected order, could the metric at lines 38-40 have mismatched label-value pairs that cause monitoring systems to report incorrect validator behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Panic Risk] What happens if label_pairs() panics during execution at line 33 - does this leave the ConstMetric struct in a partially initialized state that could be exploited in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Float Precision] Can an attacker provide NaN or Infinity values for the counter value parameter at line 36, causing arithmetic errors in metrics aggregation that hide real consensus metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_counter()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the error at line 30 leak internal implementation details about descriptor structure that could help attackers understand the metrics system architecture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_gauge()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker exploit the identical validation logic at lines 54-57 as new_counter() to bypass label length checks through integer overflow, causing out-of-bounds array access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_gauge()] [Type Confusion] Could the metric_type field at line 71 be set incorrectly if an attacker causes new_gauge() to succeed but with COUNTER type instead of GAUGE, breaking downstream monitoring systems? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: new_gauge()] [Typo Bug] Line 61 has 'guage' instead of 'gauge' - could this typo cause unexpected behavior in Prometheus serialization that breaks monitoring of validator health? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-metrics-core/src/const_metric.rs] [Function: label_pairs()] [Logic Error] Lines 94-99 create an empty Vec but immediately return it if total_labels is 0 - could this dead code path hide a bug where const_label_pairs should still be returned? (Low)",
