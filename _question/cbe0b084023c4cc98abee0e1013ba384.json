  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Key collision] Can an attacker call create_key() with an existing key name to overwrite a validator's consensus key, allowing them to impersonate the validator and sign malicious blocks causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Race condition] If multiple threads call create_key() simultaneously with the same name, can this create a race condition where different private keys are generated but only one is stored, leading to signature verification failures and validator ejection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Weak randomness] Does new_ed25519_key_pair() called by create_key() use cryptographically secure randomness, or can an attacker with knowledge of system entropy predict future validator private keys and forge signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Key persistence failure] If import_private_key() fails after key generation in create_key(), is the generated private key leaked in memory or logs, allowing an attacker to recover it and compromise validator security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Name injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or path traversal sequences in the name parameter to write keys to unintended storage locations, bypassing access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Deterministic key generation] If the same name is used across different validators, could there be any scenario where deterministic key generation occurs, causing multiple validators to have identical private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Memory leak] After generating the key pair in create_key(), is the private key properly zeroed from memory if import fails, or can it be recovered via memory dumps by an attacker with node access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent calls to create_key() and rotate_key() for the same name cause inconsistent state where public key doesn't match stored private key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Access control bypass] Does export_private_key() perform any authorization checks, or can any code component export validator consensus keys, potentially leaking them to unauthorized modules or logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Key leakage] When export_private_key() returns the Ed25519PrivateKey, is it cloned or moved, and could this leave copies in memory that persist beyond the intended lifetime, enabling memory-based attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Error information disclosure] If export_private_key() fails, does the error message reveal information about key names or storage structure that could help an attacker enumerate valid keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Side channel timing] Does export_private_key() execute in constant time, or can timing differences between success/failure cases allow an attacker to enumerate which key names exist in storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Serialization exposure] When the KVStorage.get() returns the value, could improper serialization expose the private key bytes in intermediate buffers or error messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Version confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the version parameter to retrieve previous_version keys even when they shouldn't have access, potentially obtaining rotated-out validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [TOCTOU race] Between checking current_private_key.public_key() and returning it, can a concurrent rotate_key() call invalidate the version check, returning a key that no longer matches the requested version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Key version enumeration] By repeatedly calling export_private_key_for_version() with different version public keys, can an attacker enumerate all historical versions of a validator's keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Error handling bypass] If export_private_key() for previous_version returns an error other than KeyNotSet, is it properly propagated, or could attackers exploit error handling to access keys they shouldn't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Public key comparison weakness] Does the public_key().eq() comparison use constant-time equality, or can timing attacks reveal information about stored key versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Version ambiguity] If two different private keys somehow produce the same public key (due to implementation bugs), can export_private_key_for_version() return the wrong private key? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Key validation bypass] Does import_private_key() validate that the imported Ed25519PrivateKey is well-formed and not a malicious key that could cause signature generation to fail or expose vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Arbitrary key injection] Can an attacker import a weak private key (e.g., all zeros or known compromised key) that passes validation but is cryptographically weak, compromising validator security?
