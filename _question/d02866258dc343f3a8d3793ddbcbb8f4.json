  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: is_valid_named_address()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker craft a named address with Unicode lookalike characters (homoglyphs) that appear as valid ASCII letters but bypass the is_ascii_alphabetic() check, allowing malicious address substitution during Move compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: is_valid_named_address()] [Empty string validation] Does the function properly reject empty strings, or can an empty named address pass validation when chars().next() returns None, potentially causing compilation failures or address resolution bugs?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: is_valid_named_address()] [Right-to-left override] Can an attacker inject Unicode directional override characters (U+202E) to display addresses in reverse order, causing developers to misidentify the actual address being used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: is_valid_named_address()] [Whitespace handling] Does the validation reject leading/trailing whitespace, or can spaces/tabs be added that get stripped during later processing, causing address mismatch between validation and resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: is_valid_named_address()] [Case sensitivity inconsistency] Is case sensitivity enforced consistently throughout the compilation pipeline, or can an attacker use mixed-case variants (MyAddr vs myaddr) to cause address collisions or substitution?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Error message information leak] Does the custom error message on line 71 leak sensitive information about the validation logic that could help attackers craft bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Double deserialization] Can the same JSON/TOML input be deserialized multiple times with different validation results due to stateful validation or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Deserialization panics] Can malformed serde input cause unwrap() or expect() panics before reaching the validation logic, crashing the compilation process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Type confusion] If the deserializer receives a non-string type (number, array, object), does String::deserialize() properly reject it, or can type confusion lead to unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Validation timing] Is validation performed atomically with deserialization, or can there be a TOCTOU race where the string is validated but then modified before being stored in NamedAddress(s)?
