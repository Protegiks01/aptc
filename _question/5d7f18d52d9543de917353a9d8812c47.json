  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Signature bypass] Can a Byzantine validator forge a CommitVote by manipulating the author field to not match the sender, bypassing the author==sender check and allowing them to impersonate other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Signature bypass] Does the verify() method properly validate BLS signature aggregation in CommitDecision, or can an attacker craft a decision with invalid signature tree structure that passes verification but contains forged votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Quorum bypass] In CommitDecision verification, can an attacker provide less than 2f+1 validator signatures but manipulate the signature aggregation to make it appear as a valid quorum, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Replay attack] Does the verification check for timestamp or sequence freshness, or can old CommitVote/CommitDecision messages be replayed across epochs to cause state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Epoch confusion] Can an attacker send CommitVote/CommitDecision messages with mismatched epochs to the epoch() method, causing validators to process votes from wrong epochs and breaking consensus isolation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Error handling] When verify() returns anyhow::Result error for Vote/Decision, are these errors properly logged and counted, or can Byzantine validators spam invalid messages to hide legitimate attacks in noise? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Ack/Nack bypass] The verify() method bails on Ack/Nack messages in incoming path, but can an attacker craft a malicious ConsensusMsg wrapper that bypasses this check and injects Ack/Nack into verification flow? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [DoS via verification] Can an attacker flood the network with computationally expensive CommitDecision messages requiring full quorum signature verification, causing CPU exhaustion and consensus slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Verification timing] Does optimistic_verify() in CommitVote use constant-time comparison, or can timing side-channels leak information about signature validity enabling offline signature forgery? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Cryptographic downgrade] Can an attacker manipulate the SignatureWithStatus interior mutability to mark invalid signatures as verified, bypassing subsequent validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Epoch extraction] The epoch() method returns Option<u64> which is None for Ack/Nack - can this cause validators to accept cross-epoch Ack messages leading to ack aggregation corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Integer overflow] Can epoch values in CommitVote/CommitDecision overflow u64::MAX causing epoch wraparound attacks where future epoch messages are mistaken for current epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Epoch confusion] If a validator receives CommitVote from epoch N and CommitDecision from epoch N+1 simultaneously, can race conditions in epoch() extraction cause mixing of votes across epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [None handling] When epoch() returns None for Ack/Nack, do callers properly handle this case or can unwrap() panics cause validator crashes during message processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: AckState::new()] [Validator set manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious validator iterator to AckState::new() that excludes legitimate validators or includes non-validators, corrupting the ack tracking? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: AckState::new()] [Empty validator set] What happens if AckState::new() is called with an empty iterator - does it immediately return Some(()) allowing broadcasts to complete without any acks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: AckState::new()] [Duplicate validators] If the iterator contains duplicate validator Authors, does the HashSet deduplication allow a malicious validator to ack multiple times counting as multiple validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Vote/Decision injection] The add() method bails on Vote/Decision responses but expects Ack - can an attacker bypass reliable broadcast by sending Vote/Decision as responses to prevent ack aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Nack handling] When receiving Nack response, add() bails with error - can Byzantine validators strategically send Nack to prevent broadcasts from completing and cause consensus liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Mutex poisoning] The validators HashSet is protected by Mutex - can panics during lock acquisition cause mutex poisoning that prevents future ack processing and halts consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Race condition] If multiple threads call add() concurrently for the same peer, can the validators.remove() operation race causing double-counting or missed acks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Unknown author] When add() receives ack from unknown peer, it bails with 'Unknown author' - can an attacker spam acks from non-validator peers to fill logs and hide legitimate errors? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Early completion] If validators.is_empty() returns true prematurely due to race condition, add() returns Some(()) completing broadcast before all validators acked - can this break reliable broadcast guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Quorum bypass] Does the ack aggregation enforce 2f+1 threshold or just count all validators - can 51% Byzantine validators complete broadcast by acking among themselves even without honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Ack replay] Can the same validator send multiple Ack responses, and does remove() operation prevent replay, or can a validator ack once then be re-added to enable duplicate acking? (High)"
