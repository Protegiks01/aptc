  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: InvalidMessageError] [Transaction Ordering Violation] Can InvalidMessageError in batch reconstruction allow transactions to be reordered or executed in incorrect sequence, violating transaction dependencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: InvalidMessageError] [Expired Batch Handling] Can the expired batch skip logic (lines 994-996 in observer_message.rs) combined with InvalidMessageError conditions cause observers to skip non-expired batches or process expired ones? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: InvalidMessageError] [Batch Expiration Race] Can race conditions between batch expiration checks and InvalidMessageError returns cause some observers to process batches that others reject, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: NetworkError] [Connection State Confusion] Can NetworkError conditions cause observers to incorrectly cache connection state, leading to messages being sent to wrong peers or not sent at all? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: RpcError] [RPC Replay Attack] Can the RpcError conversion (lines 22, 62-65) be exploited to replay error conditions, causing observers to reject valid messages from honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error: NetworkError] [Peer Reputation Poisoning] Can NetworkError conditions be used to unfairly damage peer reputation scores, causing observers to avoid connecting to honest but temporarily slow validators? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Severity Downgrade Attack] Can critical consensus safety violations be misclassified as benign NetworkError or UnexpectedError, causing them to be handled with insufficient urgency? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Byzantine Error Masking] Can Byzantine validators trigger legitimate-looking errors (e.g., SubscriptionTimeout) to mask malicious behavior such as equivocation or invalid block proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Error Type Confusion] Can error type conversions between different layers (network, consensus, storage) cause security-critical errors to be downgraded to operational errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Handling During Epoch Changes] [Epoch Boundary Race] Can errors occurring during epoch transitions cause observers to use incorrect epoch states for verification, accepting invalid proofs or rejecting valid ones? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Handling During Epoch Changes] [Validator Set Confusion] Can ObserverFallingBehind or SubscriptionsReset errors during epoch changes cause observers to subscribe to validators from the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Handling During Epoch Changes] [Configuration Rollback] Can error conditions during epoch transitions cause observers to roll back to old configurations, creating incompatibilities with the current validator set? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error String Construction] [Format String Injection] Can attacker-controlled data in error string parameters enable format string attacks when errors are logged or displayed? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error String Construction] [Memory Exhaustion] Can extremely long error strings constructed from attacker-controlled input cause memory exhaustion when errors are repeatedly logged? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error String Construction] [Logging System Exploitation] Can malicious error strings contain escape sequences or control characters that break logging systems or monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Construction] [String Allocation DoS] Can high-frequency error conditions cause excessive string allocations via to_string() (line 64) and format!() macros, leading to memory pressure or GC pauses? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Handling Paths] [Error Path Performance] Are error handling code paths optimized, or can attackers exploit slow error handling to cause performance degradation even when attacks are being detected? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Recovery Storm] Can rapid error-recovery cycles consume more resources than normal operation, creating a scenario where observers are stuck in permanent recovery mode? (Medium)"
