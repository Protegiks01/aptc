  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [YAML deserialization] Since ServerConfig uses serde for deserialization, can attackers exploit YAML-specific features like anchors, aliases, or merge keys to create reference cycles causing infinite loops or excessive memory consumption during config parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Billion laughs attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious YAML configuration with exponential entity expansion (billion laughs pattern) in the string fields that exhausts server memory during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Arbitrary code execution] If the configuration loader uses unsafe YAML features, can attackers inject arbitrary Rust code or shell commands through YAML tags like '!!python/object/apply' that get executed during deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Integer overflow in port] During serde deserialization of listen_port as u16, can an attacker provide values larger than 65535 that wrap around due to integer overflow, causing the faucet to bind to port 0 or other unintended ports? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [String interning vulnerability] If Rust interns the listen_address or api_path_base strings, can an attacker cause denial of service by providing many unique long strings that exhaust the string intern pool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No access control metadata] ServerConfig lacks any fields indicating whether the server should require authentication - can this lead to situations where sensitive admin endpoints are exposed without authentication due to missing configuration guidance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [IP whitelist missing] There are no fields for IP whitelisting or blacklisting - can this make it difficult to restrict faucet access to trusted networks, forcing operators to rely on external firewall rules that may be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Admin endpoint separation] Since api_path_base applies to all endpoints, is there a way to separate public faucet endpoints from admin/metrics endpoints with different authentication requirements, or will they all share the same path base? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Path traversal in api_path_base] Can api_path_base contain sequences like '../../../etc/passwd' that, when combined with routing logic, allow attackers to access files outside the intended web root? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [URL encoding bypass] If api_path_base is URL-encoded in the configuration, can attackers use double-encoding or alternate encodings to bypass path validation and inject malicious path segments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Null byte injection] Can api_path_base contain null bytes that truncate the path string in C libraries or cause routing mismatches between Rust and underlying networking libraries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Special character injection] Can api_path_base contain special characters like '#', '?', or '%' that interfere with URL parsing and routing, potentially causing endpoints to become inaccessible or routes to be misinterpreted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [DNS rebinding attack] If listen_address accepts hostnames, can attackers exploit DNS rebinding by first resolving to a safe IP during validation, then changing DNS to point to an internal IP for actual binding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Localhost bypass] Can listen_address be set to '127.0.0.1' in configuration but actually bind to '0.0.0.0' due to bugs in the socket binding code, bypassing intended localhost-only restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Port exhaustion] Can multiple faucet instances with the same default port 10212 cause port exhaustion or binding race conditions where only one instance starts successfully, causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Socket reuse vulnerabilities] Does the socket binding code enable SO_REUSEADDR or SO_REUSEPORT, and can this lead to socket hijacking attacks where a malicious process binds to the same port and intercepts faucet traffic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [IPv4/IPv6 confusion] Can mixing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in listen_address cause dual-stack binding issues where the faucet unintentionally binds to both protocols, expanding the attack surface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Length validation missing] Are there any maximum length limits on listen_address or api_path_base to prevent resource exhaustion attacks through extremely long configuration strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Regex validation missing] Is listen_address validated against a regex pattern to ensure it's a valid IP address or hostname, or can arbitrary strings be provided that cause crashes during socket binding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Path format validation] Is api_path_base validated to start with '/' and not contain query strings or fragments, or can malformed paths break routing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Mutual exclusivity] Are there conflicting configuration options that should be mutually exclusive (e.g., binding to both 0.0.0.0 and localhost), and can setting both cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Configuration leakage] If ServerConfig implements Debug or Display traits, can sensitive configuration details be logged in error messages or stack traces that are exposed to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Error message verbosity] When configuration parsing fails, do error messages reveal the full file path or internal server structure that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Thread safety] ServerConfig implements Clone but not Copy - can concurrent cloning and modification of config across threads lead to data races or torn reads of configuration values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Atomic updates] If ServerConfig is stored in Arc<Mutex<ServerConfig>> for runtime updates, can attackers exploit lock contention or priority inversion to cause denial of service? (Low)"
