  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Serialization: BCS complexity] At line 126, can ConsensusObserverResponse contain nested structures that cause exponential BCS serialization time, allowing DoS through CPU exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Serialization: Size limits] Before calling bcs::to_bytes() at line 126, is there a maximum size limit enforced to prevent generation of multi-gigabyte serialized responses? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Serialization: Bytes allocation] The Bytes::from() call at line 127 allocates memory for the entire serialized response - can this cause out-of-memory conditions for large responses? (Medium)"
