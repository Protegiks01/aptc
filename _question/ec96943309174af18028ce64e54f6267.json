  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BlockReader] [Root pruning] When roots are updated (ordered_root/commit_root), are old blocks properly pruned without leaving dangling references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Function: path_from_ordered_root()] [Pruned path elements] Can the returned path include blocks that are concurrently being pruned, causing incomplete paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BlockReader] [Determinism requirement] Do all read methods return deterministic results for the same input across validators, or could non-determinism cause divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BlockReader] [Consistency level] What consistency guarantees do methods provide - are they linearizable, sequentially consistent, or eventually consistent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BlockReader] [Failure handling] If the underlying storage fails, do methods propagate errors properly or silently return None causing incorrect decisions? (High)",
