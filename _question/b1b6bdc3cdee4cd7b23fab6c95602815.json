  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/json_encoder.rs] [DoS] [Encoding complexity] Histogram metrics create multiple entries (_count, _sum) - can many histogram metrics cause excessive encoding time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [DoS] [Request amplification] Each get_forge_metrics call parses all metrics - can repeated calls cause CPU exhaustion on the server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Integration] [Aptos data client] The service directly calls aptos_data_client methods - can errors in the data client propagate and crash the inspection service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/peer_information.rs] [Integration] [Peer metadata errors] Calls to get_metadata_for_peer may fail - are all error cases properly handled or can some cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/metrics.rs] [Integration] [Consensus health dependency] The health check depends on a specific metric name - if the metric name changes, will this break health checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [AuthN/AuthZ] [No API keys] The service has no API key or token-based authentication - is this intentional for operational simplicity or a security gap? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [AuthN/AuthZ] [IP-based access control] Is there IP allowlisting/denylisting - can only trusted monitoring systems access this service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [AuthN/AuthZ] [Firewall dependency] Does the service rely entirely on network firewalls for security - what happens if the firewall is misconfigured? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [AuthZ] [Configuration flag security] The expose_* flags provide authorization - but who can modify these flags and when? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Crypto] [Peer ID derivation] Peer IDs are exposed - are these derived from public keys in a way that reveals cryptographic relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Crypto] [Key material exposure] Even with SilentDebug, are all key types (consensus, network, validator) properly protected from leakage? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Monitoring] [Metric labels] Metric labels come from potentially untrusted sources - can label injection cause monitoring system issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Operations] [Service restart] If the inspection service crashes, does it automatically restart or remain down affecting monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Operations] [Port conflicts] What happens if the configured port is already in use - does this prevent the validator from starting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Operations] [Graceful shutdown] Is there a mechanism to gracefully shutdown the inspection service without affecting the main validator? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Error handling] [HTTP status codes] Does the client check for non-200 status codes or does it try to parse error responses as metrics? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Privacy] [System fingerprinting] Exposing detailed system information enables device fingerprinting - is this acceptable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Dependencies] [Hyper version] The service uses hyper crate - are there known vulnerabilities in the hyper version being used? (Medium)",
