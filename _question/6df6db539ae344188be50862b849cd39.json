  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 451-461] [Failure accumulation] Failures are accumulated in a Vec and printed at the end - can extremely long failure messages cause output truncation, hiding some failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 464-466] [JSON serialization] serde_json::to_string() is called without error handling - can malformed JSON cause panics or silent failures in CI reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 134-136] [Commented out tests] Nop, BytesMakeOrChange, and IncGlobal tests are commented as 'too fast' - do these fast operations contain security vulnerabilities that aren't being tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 148-149] [BCS serialization comment] BCS native call benchmark is commented out as not representative - does this mean BCS exploits (malformed serialization, infinite loops) aren't tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 342-350] [OrderBook comment] OrderBook test is commented out with TODO - does this mean market manipulation, order matching bugs, or front-running vulnerabilities aren't benchmarked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 79] [TODO for multi-sig handling] MultiSigConfig cases other than Publisher are marked todo!() - can malicious multi-sig configurations cause panics in benchmarks, hiding production vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 366-368] [Missing entry point expectation] .expect(&entry_point_name) will panic if calibration is missing - can this be exploited to prevent testing of newly added vulnerable entry points? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 406-410] [Error assertion] had_error() causes panic - does this hide partial execution results that could reveal security issues even when errors occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 129] [Sequential execution] set_not_parallel() disables parallel execution - can race conditions, deadlocks, or state corruption in parallel execution go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 361] [Sequential loop iteration] Entry points are tested sequentially - can this miss race conditions between different entry points or concurrent transaction processing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 69-70] [Type argument cloning] ty_args().to_vec() clones type arguments - can malicious type arguments cause excessive memory allocation or clone-based vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Lines: 71] [Argument cloning] args().to_vec() clones transaction arguments - can extremely large argument vectors cause memory exhaustion DoS attacks? (Low)"
