  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [TypeTag Box allocations] [Heap exhaustion] Nested types require multiple Box allocations - can attackers create types with thousands of nesting levels to cause heap fragmentation and memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [FunctionTag args/results Vecs] [Parameter explosion] Can attackers create function types with thousands of parameters/returns to exhaust memory during function signature validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [TypeTag cloning] [Clone bomb] When TypeTags are cloned, are nested structures deep-copied recursively, and can this cause exponential memory growth with carefully crafted type structures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [OPTION_MODULE_ID Lazy] [Initialization race] If multiple threads access OPTION_MODULE_ID simultaneously during first initialization, could race conditions cause different threads to see different module IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [Static ModuleId initialization] [Panic in statics] If Identifier::new() or Identifier::from() panics during static initialization (e.g., invalid identifier), will this cause validator startup failure? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [SCRIPT_MODULE_ID initialization] [MAX_ADDRESS usage] SCRIPT_MODULE_ID uses AccountAddress::MAX_ADDRESS which might not be stable across versions - could this cause script module resolution failures after upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [StructTag cross-module] [Module dependency attack] Can attackers create StructTags referencing modules from different addresses in type_args to create cross-module dependencies that break module loading order? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/language_storage.rs] [ModuleId address field] [Cross-shard attack] If Aptos implements sharding by address, can attackers craft ModuleIds that span multiple shards to cause cross-shard consistency violations? (High)",
