(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/session_change_sets.rs] [Integration: try_combine_into_storage_change_set] [Event ordering attack] Are events from VMChangeSet committed in the same order as returned by events_iter(), or can reordering cause event replay attacks? (Medium)",
