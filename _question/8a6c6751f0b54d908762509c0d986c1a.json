  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Consensus Impact] [Byzantine Validator Attack] Can a Byzantine validator exploit any of the functions in this file to corrupt their local auxiliary info database in a way that causes them to vote on blocks with incorrect transaction ordering, potentially allowing double-spending if they can get 1/3+ validators to do the same? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [State Recovery] [Incomplete Recovery] If a validator crashes during commit_auxiliary_info() after line 108 starts executing but before it completes, can the database be left in a state where some versions have auxiliary info committed but the write is not yet durable, causing data loss on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [State Recovery] [Checkpoint Restoration] If auxiliary info is restored from a checkpoint created via create_checkpoint() at line 28, but that checkpoint was created during active writes, can the restored state have missing or corrupted auxiliary info that causes subsequent transaction processing to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [State Recovery] [Pruner Progress Mismatch] If a validator crashes after write_pruner_progress() at line 33 updates progress but before the corresponding prune() deletes the data, can this cause the validator to think data is pruned when it's not on restart, leading to storage bloat or attempts to read supposedly-pruned data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Integration] [Schema Dependency] This file depends on PersistedAuxiliaryInfoSchema at line 8. If the schema implementation has bugs in serialization/deserialization, can malformed data bypass this layer's logic and corrupt the database or cause deserialization panics when auxiliary info is read? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Integration] [Metrics Overhead] At line 96 where a timer is started for metrics, can excessive calls to commit_auxiliary_info() cause metrics overhead to become significant, potentially slowing down transaction commit rates and affecting validator performance during high load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Integration] [DB Reference Leak] The struct stores Arc<DB> at line 20 and provides db() accessor at lines 39-41. Can improper use of this accessor by callers create reference cycles or prevent the database from being properly closed and cleaned up, causing resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Critical Path] [API Query Attack] Since auxiliary info is exposed via REST API endpoints, if get_persisted_auxiliary_info_iter() has performance issues or can be made to do expensive operations via crafted queries at line 58, can an attacker cause API DoS by requesting extremely large ranges or pathological version sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Critical Path] [Reorg Handling] If the blockchain reorganizes and blocks are rolled back, auxiliary info for rolled-back transactions should be deleted. If prune() is not called correctly during reorg, can stale auxiliary info remain in the database causing confusion between old and new chain tips? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Critical Path] [Version Sequence Break] The functions assume versions are sequential starting from some first_version. If due to bugs or attacks non-sequential versions are committed (e.g., version 100, 101, 105 with 102-104 missing), can get_persisted_auxiliary_info_iter() at lines 58-89 handle this correctly or will it incorrectly fill gaps with None values masking the issue? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Audit Trail] [Forensic Analysis] The auxiliary info stores transaction_index which is used for ordering analysis. If this data is corrupted or deleted prematurely via prune() at line 121, can this prevent forensic analysis of transaction ordering in case of consensus issues or attacks, hiding evidence of misbehavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/ledger_db/persisted_auxiliary_info_db.rs] [Upgrade Safety] [Schema Migration] If PersistedAuxiliaryInfo enum adds new variants in future versions, and old validators haven't upgraded, can reading new variant data via get_persisted_auxiliary_info() at line 51 cause deserialization errors that crash validators during mixed-version network upgrades? (High)"
