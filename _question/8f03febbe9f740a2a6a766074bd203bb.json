  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Rule precedence bypass] Can an attacker craft transactions that match later Allow rules while being blocked by earlier Deny rules, exploiting the first-match rule precedence to bypass security filters and inject malicious transactions into batches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Logic bypass] If batch_transaction_rules contains conflicting Allow/Deny rules for the same criteria, can an attacker exploit the sequential evaluation order to cause inconsistent filtering behavior across different validators, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to allows_transaction() with the same batch_id but different batch_transaction_rules states cause non-deterministic filtering results, leading to validator disagreement on which transactions to accept?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: allows_transaction()] [Early return exploit] Does the early return at line 39 for empty filters create a vulnerability where critical security checks are bypassed if the filter becomes empty through deserialization errors or memory corruption?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-transaction-filters/src/batch_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: empty()] [Initialization vulnerability] Can an attacker force the use of empty() filter through configuration manipulation or API abuse, causing all transactions to be allowed by default and bypassing security controls?
