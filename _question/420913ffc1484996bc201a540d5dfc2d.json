  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Empty shares - Critical] What happens if shares.len() == 0 is passed to reconstruct() - does assert_ge! correctly catch this, or can it cause undefined behavior before the assertion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Timing attack - Medium] Does the reconstruction timing vary based on which specific shares are provided or their values, potentially leaking information about the secret through timing side channels during threshold signature operations? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Cache timing - Low] Do the memory access patterns in the zip iterator and sum operations create cache-timing vulnerabilities that could leak share values to co-located attackers? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Interpolation correctness - Critical] Does reconstruction at alpha=Scalar::ZERO correctly retrieve the constant term (the secret) of the polynomial, or can the evaluation point choice lead to reconstructing a different coefficient? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Field consistency - High] Are all operations performed in the same finite field as the original secret sharing, or can field element conversions between blstrs::Scalar and other types cause reconstruction to produce values in the wrong field?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Uniqueness guarantee - High] Is it mathematically guaranteed that any t shares from the same polynomial produce the same reconstructed secret, or can floating-point rounding or field arithmetic create different outputs?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Share mutation - High] Is the shares slice borrowed immutably throughout reconstruction, or can concurrent modification of share values during Lagrange computation produce inconsistent results?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Config mutation - Critical] Can the ThresholdConfigBlstrs be modified (e.g., threshold changed) during an ongoing reconstruction, causing the threshold check to pass but Lagrange coefficients to be computed with different parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Iterator invalidation - Medium] Can the vectors created at lines 25 and 31-34 be invalidated during the zip/map/sum chain, causing use-after-free or incorrect reconstruction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [DKG integration - Critical] When used in Distributed Key Generation, can an attacker who participates in DKG provide malicious shares that pass threshold checks but reconstruct to a known secret, compromising validator keys?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Proactive security - High] If proactive secret sharing is used for key refreshing, can reconstruction fail to produce the correct secret after share updates due to version mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [VSS verification - Medium] Does this reconstruction assume shares have been verified through Verifiable Secret Sharing, or can unverified shares cause silent corruption of the reconstructed secret? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Domain poisoning - Critical] Can a malicious ThresholdConfigBlstrs inject a batch_evaluation_domain with incorrect roots of unity, causing all Lagrange coefficients to be wrong and enabling controlled secret reconstruction?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Domain size attack - High] If batch_evaluation_domain.N() returns a value smaller than the maximum player ID, can this cause array out-of-bounds in lagrange_coefficients() when accessing omega^id?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Domain reuse - Medium] Can the same batch_evaluation_domain be reused across multiple reconstruction calls safely, or does state pollution from previous calls affect current reconstruction?
