  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between reading the size header at line 49 and record data at line 62, can an attacker modify the underlying storage (time-of-check-time-of-use), causing size/data mismatch that corrupts restored state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Compression bypass] If records are compressed, does read_record_bytes handle decompression bomb attacks where small backup files expand to gigabytes when decompressed, exhausting validator memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Encryption oracle] If backup data is encrypted, can timing differences in read_record_bytes operations leak information about plaintext content, enabling oracle attacks to decrypt sensitive validator state data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Hash collision] Can an attacker create backup records with identical size headers but different content, exploiting potential hash collisions to restore invalid state that matches expected checksums? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Trait: ReadRecordBytes] [Storage tampering] Since the trait works with any AsyncRead implementation, can attackers compromise backup storage backends (S3, GCS) and inject malicious data that read_record_bytes processes without authentication? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Partial write attacks] Can an attacker exploit backup storage systems that support partial writes to create records where the size header doesn't match actual stored data length, causing restoration failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Storage quotas] Can attackers trigger backup reads that exceed cloud storage egress quotas, causing read failures that prevent legitimate validator recovery during network incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_full_buf_or_none()] [Retry amplification] If network reads fail and retry, can attackers amplify costs by forcing repeated large record reads that exceed validator operators' cloud service budgets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Format version bypass] Does the record format include version information, or can attackers mix records from incompatible backup format versions causing deserialization errors during restoration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Metadata injection] Can attackers inject custom metadata in the 4-byte size field using reserved bits that cause downstream parsing errors when records are deserialized by AptosDB? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Padding exploitation] If records require alignment padding, can attackers hide malicious data in padding bytes that gets included in the Bytes returned at line 67 and processed as valid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Magic number bypass] Does the backup format include magic numbers for validation, or can attackers provide arbitrary binary data that read_record_bytes accepts as valid backup records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Record boundary confusion] Can attackers exploit the lack of record boundary markers (only size-prefixed) to shift record boundaries and cause data from one record to be interpreted as part of another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [Allocation attack vector] Can an attacker chain multiple large allocations by creating backup files with many records of size 0x3FFFFFFF (1GB each), exhausting available memory at line 61 before OOM killer activates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_full_buf_or_none()] [Fragmentation attack] Can repeated calls with varying buffer capacities cause memory fragmentation that degrades validator performance and eventually leads to allocation failures during critical backup operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function: read_record_bytes()] [File descriptor leak] If read operations fail repeatedly, can unclosed file descriptors accumulate and reach process limits, preventing validators from opening new backup files or network connections?
