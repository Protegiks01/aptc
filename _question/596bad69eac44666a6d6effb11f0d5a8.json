  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Branch prediction attacks] Does the Diffie-Hellman implementation avoid secret-dependent branches that could leak information through branch prediction side-channels? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization timing] Could the serialization of keys have timing variations based on key content that leak information to side-channel attackers? (Low)",
