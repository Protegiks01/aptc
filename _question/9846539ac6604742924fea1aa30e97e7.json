  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Lines: 72-77, 197-201] [Annotation retention] Can keeping test-only annotations (KEEP_UNINIT_ANNOTATIONS, VARIABLE_COALESCING_ANNOTATE) in production builds leak internal compiler state or debugging information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Lines: 283-287] [Error suppression] Does SKIP_BAILOUT_ON_EXTENDED_CHECKS suppress all extended check errors or only specific categories, and can it hide critical security vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Lines: 54-59] [Version compatibility] Can forcing REFERENCE_SAFETY_V3=off to use older checkers expose validators to vulnerabilities fixed in v3? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Experiment listing] Is there a complete enumeration or validation that all defined experiments are actually used by the compiler, or can unused experiments be silently ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Default consistency] Are default values (Given vs Inherited) consistent with the intended security posture (e.g., all safety checks default to true)? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Related: options.rs experiment_on_recursive()] [Recursion depth] Is there a maximum recursion depth for experiment inheritance chains, or can excessively deep chains cause stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Lines: 41-311] [Immutability] Can EXPERIMENTS be modified after initialization, potentially allowing runtime tampering with compiler flags? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Related: options.rs panics] Do experiment-related panics (unknown experiment, invalid value, circular dependency) prevent compilation or can they be caught and suppressed? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Lines: 5-18] [Documentation] Does the file-level documentation accurately describe all security-relevant behaviors, or could undocumented features be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Meta-experiments] Can meta-experiments (CHECKS, OPTIMIZE, EXTENDED_FRAMEWORK_OPTIMIZATIONS) be used to toggle multiple security-critical flags in a single setting, making auditing difficult? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/experiments.rs] [Experiment combinations] Is there testing for all critical experiment combinations (e.g., CHECKS=off + COMPILE_FOR_TESTING=on), or can untested combinations expose vulnerabilities? (High)"
