  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: validator_index] [Out-of-bounds] Can validator_index be set to a value greater than the actual validator set size, causing out-of-bounds accesses when indexing into validator arrays and leading to panics or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: validator_index] [Reward manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate their validator_index to point to a different validator's performance data, allowing them to steal rewards intended for high-performing validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: validator_index] [Index persistence] If validator_index values are not properly updated during epoch transitions when the validator set changes, can stale indices cause validators to be matched with incorrect performance data or voting power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: validator_index] [Negative wrap] Although validator_index is u64, can arithmetic operations involving this index cause underflow wrapping to very large values when used in calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: validator_index] [Consensus confusion] Can mismatched validator_index values between ValidatorConfig and actual consensus validator set ordering cause votes to be attributed to wrong validators, breaking quorum calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: new()] [No validation] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on its parameters, or can callers construct ValidatorConfig with completely invalid data (empty addresses, invalid keys, wrong indices) that later causes consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Direct construction] Can ValidatorConfig be constructed directly without going through proper validation layers in the Move staking contract, allowing bypassing of on-chain validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Type safety] Does the new() function enforce any type-level invariants or is it possible to construct semantically invalid ValidatorConfig instances that violate protocol assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero values] Can new() be called with all-zero or default values for critical fields like consensus_public_key, creating a useless validator configuration that breaks consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep copy safety] When ValidatorConfig is cloned, are the Vec<u8> fields (validator_network_addresses, fullnode_network_addresses) properly deep-copied, or can shared references lead to unexpected mutations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization determinism] Is ValidatorConfig serialization deterministic across different Rust compiler versions and platforms, or can non-deterministic serialization cause state hash mismatches between validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Untrusted deserialization] When ValidatorConfig is deserialized from untrusted sources (e.g., state sync), are there any deserialization bombs or malicious inputs that can crash the node or consume excessive resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Can the PartialEq implementation be exploited to treat distinct ValidatorConfig instances as equal, potentially allowing validator impersonation or config substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Derive: Default] [Unsafe defaults] Does the Default implementation for ValidatorConfig create a valid configuration, or does it produce invalid default values (e.g., empty addresses, zero key) that should never be used in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module/struct name mismatch] Can the MODULE_NAME ('stake') and STRUCT_NAME ('ValidatorConfig') constants be manipulated or mismatched during compilation, causing the Move VM to fail reading ValidatorConfig resources from storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Resource safety] Does the MoveResource implementation for ValidatorConfig ensure that validator configurations are treated as proper Move resources with linear type semantics, preventing duplication or deletion outside of staking contract logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type confusion] Can type confusion occur if another struct with the same MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME is defined elsewhere, causing the wrong data to be deserialized into ValidatorConfig? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorOperatorConfigResource] [Field: human_name] [Unbounded size] Is there a size limit on the human_name Vec<u8> field, or can an attacker set it to gigabytes of data causing storage bloat and memory exhaustion when validators read operator configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorOperatorConfigResource] [Field: human_name] [Encoding validation] Is human_name validated to be valid UTF-8 or ASCII, or can arbitrary binary data be stored that causes display issues or injection attacks in explorers and APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorOperatorConfigResource] [Field: human_name] [Name collision] Can multiple operators use identical human_name values, causing confusion in validator selection or operator attribution in staking interfaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorOperatorConfigResource] [Field: human_name] [Unicode normalization] If human_name contains Unicode characters, can lack of normalization cause two different byte sequences to appear identical to users, enabling homograph phishing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorOperatorConfigResource] [Default implementation] Does the Default implementation create a ValidatorOperatorConfigResource with empty human_name, and can this empty state cause issues in operator identification logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Concurrent reads] When multiple threads read ValidatorConfig from shared state during epoch transitions, can race conditions cause validators to see inconsistent configurations leading to consensus disagreements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where validator_network_addresses is validated, but then modified before being used, allowing invalid addresses to be used in consensus networking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Atomic updates] Are updates to ValidatorConfig atomic across all fields, or can partial updates during validator config rotation lead to inconsistent state (e.g., new key with old network addresses)? (High)"
