  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_operator_stake()] [Format string injection] The function uses format!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_operator_stake()] [Separator collision] If ACCOUNT_SEPARATOR ('-') appears in the hex-encoded operator address, could this break the operator_address() parsing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_operator_stake()] [Operator impersonation] Can an attacker create an operator stake account with an arbitrary operator address to impersonate a legitimate validator operator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_active_stake()] [Logic flaw] The function requires address == ACTIVE_STAKE && metadata.is_none() - can an attacker bypass this by setting metadata to Some with invalid data, causing type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_active_stake()] [Delegator confusion] Since is_active_stake() returns false when metadata is present, could this cause confusion between regular and delegated active stakes in balance calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_pending_inactive_stake()] [Metadata bypass] The check requires metadata.is_none() - can an attacker set empty metadata to bypass delegated stake checks while appearing as regular stake? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_inactive_stake()] [State manipulation] Can an attacker craft sub-accounts that claim to be inactive_stake but actually reference delegated stakes, leading to incorrect unlocking of funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_commission()] [Reward theft] Can an attacker create commission sub-accounts for validators they don't operate to query or claim unauthorized commission rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_rewards()] [Reward manipulation] Does is_rewards() properly verify ownership before allowing reward queries, or could attackers check rewards for arbitrary accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_delegator_active_stake()] [Type boundary] The function checks address == ACTIVE_STAKE && metadata.is_some() - what happens if metadata is Some but contains invalid pool_address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_delegator_inactive_stake()] [Pool validation] Does is_delegator_inactive_stake() verify that the pool in metadata actually exists, or could attackers reference non-existent pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_delegator_pending_inactive_stake()] [Metadata spoofing] Can an attacker set metadata.pool_address to another user's pool to query their pending unstaking information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: SubAccountIdentifier::operator_address()] [Parsing vulnerability] The function splits on ACCOUNT_SEPARATOR and expects format 'stake-<operator>' - can an attacker inject multiple separators to cause parsing errors or bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: SubAccountIdentifier::operator_address()] [Iterator exhaustion] The function calls parts.next() twice without checking - can an attacker provide 'stake-' without an operator part to cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: SubAccountIdentifier::operator_address()] [Extra parts] If the address contains 'stake-operator1-operator2', which operator is extracted? Could attackers exploit multiple parts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: SubAccountIdentifier::operator_address()] [String validation] After extracting the operator string, it calls str_to_account_address() - can invalid operators cause cascading failures in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: SubAccountIdentifier::operator_address()] [Case sensitivity] Does the check 'stake == STAKE' properly handle case variations like 'STAKE' or 'Stake', potentially allowing operator address extraction from invalid formats? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: from_block()] [Block height manipulation] The function sets index to block.block_height directly - can an attacker manipulate BcsBlock to provide inconsistent height values causing consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: from_block()] [Hash collision] BlockHash::new(chain_id, block.block_height) creates a fake hash from chain_id-block_height - can attackers create collisions by manipulating chain_id to get same hash for different blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: from_block()] [Integer overflow] If block_height is u64::MAX or very large, could BlockHash::new() cause integer overflow or formatting issues? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: chain_id()] [Type conversion] The function uses try_into() to convert to ChainId - can this conversion fail silently or return unexpected chain IDs for malformed network strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&NetworkIdentifier> for ChainId] [Network spoofing] The function calls ChainId::from_str(network_identifier.network.trim()) - can attackers provide network strings that parse as valid ChainIds but represent different networks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&NetworkIdentifier> for ChainId] [Whitespace bypass] The trim() call might allow attackers to add whitespace padding to bypass network validation while still parsing correctly - could this cause cross-network transaction replay? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&NetworkIdentifier> for ChainId] [Blockchain field ignored] The conversion only checks the network field and ignores the blockchain field - can attackers set blockchain to non-'aptos' values without detection?
