  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious filename parameter with path traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd') to read arbitrary files from the filesystem when File::open() is called? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_trace_file()] [Symlink Attack] If the filename points to a symbolic link, could an attacker exploit time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions to redirect file operations to unintended targets? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Panic/DoS] The line.split(',') operation assumes exactly 2 comma-separated values, but what happens if the trace file contains lines with 0, 1, or >2 commas? Can splits.next().unwrap() cause a panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Integer Overflow] When parsing 'pc' with parse::<u64>().unwrap(), can an attacker provide extremely large numbers (e.g., '18446744073709551615') that cause issues in downstream code or overflow in calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Panic/DoS] The context.split('::') operation is followed by context_segs.pop().unwrap() calls - can an attacker craft input with fewer than expected '::' separators to trigger panics? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: TraceMap::update_from_trace_file()] [Duplicate Parsing Logic] The trace file parsing logic is duplicated between CoverageMap and TraceMap implementations - are there inconsistencies that could lead to different security properties? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an extremely large trace file (gigabytes) that causes the BufReader to consume excessive memory as it reads all lines into the BTreeMap structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Memory Exhaustion] The read_to_end(&mut bytes) operation reads the entire file into memory - can an attacker provide a multi-gigabyte binary file to cause out-of-memory conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Unbounded Growth] The BTreeMap structures (exec_maps, module_maps, function_maps) have no size limits - can an attacker craft a trace file with millions of unique entries to exhaust memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: insert()] [Cascade Insertion] The cascading insert operations create nested BTreeMap entries without bounds checking - can this be exploited to create deeply nested structures consuming excessive memory? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: insert_multi()] [Integer Overflow] The line '*pc_entry += count' adds to an existing u64 counter - can repeated insertions with large count values cause integer overflow, wrapping the coverage counter back to 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: ModuleCoverageMap::insert_multi()] [Counter Saturation] If coverage counters overflow from u64::MAX back to 0, could this cause incorrect coverage reports that hide actually executed code, affecting security audits?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: to_unified_exec_map()] [Accumulation Overflow] When multiple exec_maps are unified and counts are accumulated via insert_multi(), can the cumulative sum overflow u64::MAX? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Dummy Exec ID] The hardcoded 'dummy_exec_id' is used for all entries - does this cause all coverage data to be merged into a single execution ID, potentially losing important execution context?
