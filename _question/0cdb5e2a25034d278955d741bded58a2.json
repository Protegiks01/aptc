  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Network interface poisoning] Are network_client and network_service_events cryptographically validated before JWK consensus startup, or can man-in-the-middle attacks compromise JWK protocol messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Expect panic vulnerability] Can the .expect() call on jwk_consensus_subscriptions be triggered by an attacker to crash validator nodes handling JWK consensus? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_observer_and_publisher()] [Configuration bypass] Can an attacker manipulate node_config.consensus_observer to enable observer/publisher when it should be disabled, causing unauthorized consensus data leakage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_observer_and_publisher()] [Network interface injection] Does the .expect() on consensus_observer_interfaces properly validate that interfaces came from trusted sources, or can injected interfaces redirect consensus data to attacker-controlled nodes? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_observer_and_publisher()] [Publisher runtime isolation] Does the consensus_publisher_runtime have proper isolation from the observer runtime, or can resource exhaustion in one affect the other causing validator degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_observer_and_publisher()] [Notifier cloning vulnerability] Does consensus_notifier maintain security invariants when used by both observer creation and other components, or can shared state lead to notification forgery? (Medium)",
