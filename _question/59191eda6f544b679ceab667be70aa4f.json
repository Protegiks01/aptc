  "[File: config/src/config/indexer_grpc_config.rs] [Serde Features] [Feature Flag] Are there Serde feature flags that could change deserialization behavior in different build configurations, causing inconsistent validation? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/indexer_grpc_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Recursive Validation] Does sanitize() recursively validate nested configurations (storage, indexer_table_info), or only check top-level fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/indexer_grpc_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Idempotency] Is optimize() idempotent, or can repeated calls cause state drift or unexpected side effects? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/indexer_grpc_config.rs] [Config Traits] [Trait Implementation] Do ConfigSanitizer and ConfigOptimizer traits have security-relevant methods beyond sanitize() and optimize() that aren't implemented? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/indexer_grpc_config.rs] [Error Type] [Information Leak] Does the Error::ConfigSanitizerFailed error type at line 99 include stack traces or sensitive system information that could aid attackers? (Low)"
