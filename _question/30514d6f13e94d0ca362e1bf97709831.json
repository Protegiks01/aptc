  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 332-341] [Debug Assert] Code contains debug_assert!(false) for nonce mismatch - can production builds without debug assertions skip important invariant checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 206] [Debug Assert] debug_assert!(false) for unexpected direct send - are there scenarios where this legitimately occurs but gets suppressed in release builds? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 230-264] [Thundering Herd] All peers are pinged at the same tick - can this cause network congestion spikes that affect consensus message delivery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: new(), line 104] [Fixed Ping Interval] ping_interval is fixed at initialization - can inability to adapt interval based on network conditions cause false positives during temporary congestion? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 285] [Serialization Memory] to_bytes() allocates memory for message serialization - can large nonce values or repeated Pong responses cause memory pressure? (Low)",
