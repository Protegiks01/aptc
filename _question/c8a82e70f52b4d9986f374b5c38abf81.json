  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Global Static: TIMER] [Race condition] Can concurrent first-time access to the TIMER lazy static from multiple benchmark threads cause initialization race conditions that lead to metric registration failures or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Global Static: NUM_TXNS] [Race condition] Can simultaneous initialization of NUM_TXNS from parallel benchmark executions result in duplicate metric registration or registry conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Global Static: TIMER] [Panic handling] If the exponential_buckets() call fails during TIMER initialization, does the unwrap() cause a panic that crashes the benchmark process, potentially masking critical performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Global Static: NUM_TXNS] [Panic handling] Can the unwrap() on register_int_counter_vec! cause unrecoverable panics during benchmark initialization if metric registration fails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Function: exponential_buckets()] [Configuration error] Can incorrect exponential bucket parameters (start=1e-9, factor=2.0, count=32) cause metric granularity issues that hide performance regressions in production code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: TIMER] [Overflow] With 32 exponential buckets starting at 1 nanosecond, can extremely long benchmark operations exceed the maximum bucket boundary, causing metrics to be bucketed incorrectly or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: NUM_TXNS] [Counter overflow] Can the IntCounterVec overflow if benchmarks process extremely large transaction volumes (approaching u64::MAX), causing metric wraparound and incorrect performance data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: TIMER] [Label injection] Can callers provide arbitrary 'name' label values when recording timer metrics, potentially injecting malicious metric labels that cause cardinality explosion in the metrics backend? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: TIMER] [Memory exhaustion] Can unlimited unique 'name' label values cause unbounded memory growth in the HistogramVec, eventually exhausting available memory during long-running benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: NUM_TXNS] [Memory exhaustion] Can benchmark code create unlimited unique 'stage' label combinations, causing the IntCounterVec to consume excessive memory and impact system stability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/metrics.rs] [Global Static: TIMER] [Resource leak] Are histogram buckets properly cleaned up when the benchmark process terminates, or can repeated benchmark runs cause metric registry memory leaks? (Low)",
