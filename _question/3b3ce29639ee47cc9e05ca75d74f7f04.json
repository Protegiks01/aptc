  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: ObjectPool::clone_from_pool()] [Clone bound] This function requires T: Clone - can expensive Clone implementations cause performance issues or DoS when cloning large objects? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: ObjectPool::clone_from_pool()] [choose_multiple] The choose_multiple can panic if num_to_copy > pool size - is this properly validated by callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: create_account_transaction()] [Balance validation] If creation_balance > 0, aptos_account_transfer is called - can this overdraft the from account if balance is insufficient? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: create_account_transaction()] [Account collision] If the to address already exists, does aptos_account_transfer handle this correctly, or can funds be lost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: create_account_transaction()] [Zero balance handling] When creation_balance is 0, aptos_account_create_account is called - can this create unfunded accounts that become unusable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: create_account_transaction()] [Signature replay] The sign_with_transaction_builder uses the from account's sequence number - can concurrent calls cause sequence number collisions and transaction rejection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: create_account_transaction()] [Gas estimation] No explicit gas limit is set - can complex account creation scenarios cause out-of-gas failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: WorkflowProgress::WhenDone] [Delay overflow] The delay_between_stages_s is u64 - can extremely large delay values cause integer overflow when converted to Duration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Function: WorkflowProgress::when_done_default()] [Hardcoded delay] The default 10-second delay is hardcoded - can this cause issues in high-frequency testing or time-sensitive scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: AccountType] [Keyless validation] The Keyless variant exists but no validation is shown - can Keyless accounts bypass signature verification or authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: AccountType] [Default to Local] The default is Local - can this cause security issues if Keyless accounts are expected but Local is used instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function race] Can concurrent calls to create_txn_generator_creator() and ObjectPool methods cause race conditions on shared addresses_pool and accounts_pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function race] If TransactionGenerator::generate_transactions() and ReliableTransactionSubmitter::execute_transactions() run concurrently, can sequence numbers become inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function race] Can RootAccountHandle::get_root_account() return the same Arc to multiple generators, causing them to generate conflicting transactions with the same sequence numbers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function race] Can CounterState updates from multiple execute_transactions_with_counter() calls race, causing lost updates or incorrect metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Integer overflow] Can the weight parameter in transaction_mix calculations overflow when summing all weights, causing incorrect weight distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Integer overflow] Can max_account_working_set * creation_balance overflow u64, causing incorrect fund allocation or account creation limits? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Integer overflow] Can num_modules parameter overflow when allocating memory for module storage or deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Memory safety] Can the mutable reference to source_accounts in create_txn_generator_creator() be aliased through Arc clones, violating Rust's aliasing rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Memory safety] Can the static lifetime on PreBuiltPackages trait objects cause use-after-free if the actual object is deallocated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Memory safety] Can Vec::drain() in take_from_pool() cause iterator invalidation if the Vec is accessed from another thread during drain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Memory safety] Can swap_with_slice in add_to_pool_bounded() cause memory corruption if slice sizes don't match exactly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Async safety] The create_txn_generator_creator() is async and awaits on multiple generators - can these awaits deadlock if they depend on each other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Async safety] Can the async RootAccountHandle::approve_funds() cause race conditions if multiple approval requests execute concurrently? (High)"
