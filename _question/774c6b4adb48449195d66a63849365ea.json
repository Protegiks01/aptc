  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/options.rs] [Struct: Options (line 29)] [Clone Safety] The derived Clone implementation at line 29 clones the RefCell - does this create a new RefCell or share the underlying data, and can this cause non-deterministic compilation across validators?
