  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - Unexpected messages] [Warning suppression] Unexpected messages only generate warnings - can flooding unexpected messages hide legitimate security events in logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - RPC request handling] [RPC message validation] Are RPC requests validated before being pushed to rpc_tx, or can invalid RPC requests cause downstream processing errors? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - DeprecatedBlockRetrievalRequest] [Migration period exploitation] During the deprecation period, can attackers switch between deprecated and new request formats to bypass version-specific security checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - BlockRetrievalRequest] [Request validation difference] Are there validation differences between deprecated and new BlockRetrievalRequest that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - BatchRequestMsg] [Batch request flooding] Can attackers flood batch requests to exhaust RPC channel capacity and prevent legitimate block retrievals? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - DAGMessage] [DAG request injection] Can DAG messages be injected with manipulated sender addresses to bypass DAG-specific authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - CommitMessage] [Commit message ordering] Can CommitMessage RPCs be delivered out of order, causing validators to process commits before votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - Default case] [Unhandled message types] The default `_` case warns about unexpected messages - can new message types be injected that bypass all validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start() - Channel push errors] [Error propagation] When rpc_tx.push() fails, only warning is logged - can systematic channel failures cause RPC request loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Struct: NetworkSender - Arc<ValidatorVerifier>] [Verifier consistency] Can the ValidatorVerifier be updated during epoch changes leading to race conditions where old and new verifiers coexist? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Struct: NetworkSender - TimeService] [Time manipulation] Can TimeService be manipulated to cause timeout miscalculations affecting consensus liveness and safety? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Global: fail_point macros] [Production fail point leak] Are all fail_point! macros properly compiled out in release builds, or can they be exploited in production? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Global: Counters] [Counter atomicity] Are the counters::CONSENSUS_SENT_MSGS and other metrics atomic, or can race conditions cause incorrect counting? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Global: Box<dyn Stream>] [Stream trait object safety] Can attackers exploit trait object upcasting or downcasting to bypass stream type safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Global: Event<ConsensusMsg>] [Event ordering guarantees] Does the Event stream guarantee ordering between Message and RpcRequest events, or can reordering cause consensus violations? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Global: Clone implementations] [Clone cost] Can expensive clone operations on large messages cause performance degradation during broadcasts? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Cross-function: broadcast vs send] [Delivery inconsistency] Can the combination of broadcast (to all) and send (to subset) create situations where some validators receive duplicate messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Cross-function: Self-send timing] [Self-message race] Can self-messages arrive before network messages due to different code paths, causing validators to process their own proposals before receiving network confirmation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Cross-function: RPC timeout consistency] [Timeout variability] Different RPC functions use different timeouts (500ms for commit_vote) - can this inconsistency be exploited for timing attacks? (Medium)",
