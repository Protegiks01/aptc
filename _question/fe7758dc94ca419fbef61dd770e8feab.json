  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: emit()] [Writer Consistency] If emit() is called multiple times on the same JsonEmitter, is there proper state management to ensure the JSON output remains valid, or can partial writes corrupt the output stream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: emit()] [Diagnostic Consistency] The new diagnostic created at lines 33-39 copies data from the input diagnostic - can inconsistencies between the original and copied diagnostic cause semantic errors in the JSON output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: emit()] [Label Transformation] The label transformation at lines 26-31 changes FileId to String - can this transformation lose information or introduce ambiguities that corrupt error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: emit()] [Writer Encoding] Does the writer enforce UTF-8 encoding, or can binary data in diagnostic messages cause encoding errors when written at line 40-41? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: emit()] [JSON Streaming] Since each emit() writes one JSON object plus newline, is this valid JSON stream format, or should it be wrapped in an array to form valid JSON document? Can this format confusion cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/json.rs] [Function: new()] [Writer Null] Can the writer parameter at line 17 be null or invalid, causing undefined behavior when accessed in emit()? (Low)"
