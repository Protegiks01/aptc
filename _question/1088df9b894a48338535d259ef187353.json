  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Index Corruption] Can checkout() operations on repositories with malformed git index files cause heap corruption or buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Dependency Chain Attack] Can attackers inject malicious dependencies that themselves have git dependencies, creating a chain of malicious clones that bypass single-level security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Version Pinning Bypass] If Move packages specify exact commit hashes for dependencies, can attackers still exploit checkout() to switch to malicious code through tag/branch confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Circular Dependency DoS] Can malicious packages create circular git dependency chains that cause infinite clone loops and resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Build-Time Code Execution] Can code in cloned repositories execute during build time (via build scripts, hooks, or attributes) before security scans can detect malicious behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Windows Path Length] On Windows, can attackers exploit path length limitations (MAX_PATH) by cloning repositories with extremely long file names that cause operations to fail insecurely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Case-Insensitive Filesystem] On case-insensitive filesystems (Windows, macOS), can attackers exploit filename collisions to overwrite legitimate files with malicious ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Line Ending Conversion] Can attackers exploit platform-specific line ending conversions (CRLF vs LF) to inject code that behaves differently on Windows vs Unix? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Reserved Filename Exploitation] On Windows, can attackers use reserved filenames (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL) in repositories to cause git operations to fail or behave unexpectedly? (Low)"
