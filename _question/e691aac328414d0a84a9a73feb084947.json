  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying interaction between DuplicationChecker and type safety verification - could duplicate type signatures bypass type safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that DuplicationChecker runs before reference safety verification - could duplicate references confuse borrow checking? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that module dependencies are checked for duplicates before the current module - could duplicate imports from malicious dependencies bypass verification? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that deserialized modules with duplicates are rejected - could malicious bytecode serialization tricks bypass duplication detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that compressed bytecode properly decompresses duplicate-free - could compression artifacts introduce false duplicates or hide real duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that ULEB128 encoding variations for indices don't bypass duplication checking - could equivalent indices with different encodings appear unique? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying backward compatibility of duplication checks - could old modules that were valid become invalid after verifier updates, breaking deployed contracts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test verifying that module upgrades don't introduce duplicates - could upgrading a module add duplicate elements that bypass checks due to upgrade path assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for versioned bytecode format - could different bytecode versions have different duplication semantics causing verification inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for duplicate labels in bytecode - could duplicate jump targets cause control flow confusion and bypass safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for duplicate local variables in function code - could duplicate local indices cause stack corruption or unexpected aliasing? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for duplicate branch targets in control flow - could duplicate branch destinations bypass stack depth verification or type checking? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for duplicate exception handlers - could duplicate try-catch handlers cause incorrect exception handling semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Attack Scenario] Could an attacker submit a module with exactly 2^16 - 1 elements to cause integer overflow in TableIndex when checking duplicates at the maximum index? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Attack Scenario] Could an attacker craft a module where duplicate detection succeeds but later compilation stages assume no duplicates, causing code generation bugs that enable arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Attack Scenario] Could a Byzantine validator submit a module that passes duplication checking on their node but fails on others due to non-deterministic behavior, causing consensus split? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Attack Scenario] Could an attacker exploit timing differences in duplicate detection (e.g., early vs late duplicates) to perform timing side-channel attacks revealing information about other modules?
