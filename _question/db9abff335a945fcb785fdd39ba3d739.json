  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Peer disconnection race] Between checking peer connectivity and sending the request (lines 93-98), can a peer disconnect causing the request to be sent to a stale connection and hang until timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Label consistency] On lines 81, 88, 111, 120, request.get_label() is called multiple times - is this method pure, or can it return different values between calls causing metric/log inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Type label validation] Does get_label() on the request types use static strings, or can dynamic label generation allow injection attacks in metrics systems? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Memory allocation] If request or response objects are very large, can repeated calls cause excessive memory allocation leading to OOM conditions affecting validator stability? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Connection pooling] Does the network_client properly manage connection resources, or can rapid send_request() calls exhaust the connection pool and prevent legitimate consensus messages? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Network ID isolation] Can an attacker on one network (e.g., public fullnode network) send monitoring requests to peers on another network (e.g., validator network) through PeerNetworkId manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Network boundary violation] Does the function validate that the peer_network_id corresponds to an allowed network for monitoring, or can cross-network probing leak validator topology? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Empty response handling] Can a malicious peer send an empty or minimal response that passes validation but provides no useful information, wasting monitoring resources? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Maximum timeout edge case] What happens when Duration::from_millis is called with u64::MAX - does this create a timeout that effectively never expires, blocking monitoring indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request at shutdown] If called during node shutdown, can the async operation deadlock or cause graceful shutdown to fail, requiring forceful termination? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Response-request correlation] After receiving a response on line 41-49, is there validation that the response actually corresponds to the sent request, or can a malicious peer send cached/replayed responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Response timestamp validation] Do responses include timestamps, and if so, are they validated to prevent time-travel attacks or stale response replay? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Metric storage DoS] Can an attacker trigger error conditions on line 125-129 repeatedly to cause unbounded metric storage growth and exhaust disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Log storage DoS] Can malicious peers trigger warn! logs on lines 117-124 at high frequency to fill disk with logs and cause monitoring system failure? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [RPC protocol adherence] Does the send_to_peer_rpc call on lines 41-48 enforce proper RPC protocol semantics (request-response pairing), or can protocol violations cause message corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Serialization consistency] Is the serialization format for PeerMonitoringServiceMessage deterministic, or can different serializations of the same logical request cause caching or deduplication issues? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Validator impact] If used to monitor validators during consensus, can slow responses or timeouts from send_request() block consensus-critical paths and degrade network performance? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Priority inversion] Does peer monitoring traffic use the same network priority as consensus messages, potentially causing priority inversion where monitoring DoS blocks consensus? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Peer authentication] Is the recipient peer's identity cryptographically verified before sending requests, or can MITM attackers intercept monitoring requests to learn network topology? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Authorization bypass] Does the function check that the local node is authorized to monitor the target peer, or can unauthorized nodes probe validator internals? (Medium)"
