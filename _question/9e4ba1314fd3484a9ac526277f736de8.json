  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Cross-function: main() experiments] [Sequential execution assumption] Could the sequential execution of experiments (lines 63-104) hide race conditions that would occur with concurrent rate limiter usage in production validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Cross-function: TcpListener reuse] [Port reuse vulnerability] Does each experiment properly release the TCP port before the next one starts, or could TIME_WAIT states cause bind failures in rapid succession affecting rate limiter reliability testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Cross-function: Runtime sharing] [Thread pool exhaustion] Could the single Runtime instance at line 61 become exhausted with blocking tasks, causing later experiments to starve and produce inaccurate rate limiter measurements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Cross-function: Statistics aggregation] [Data race] Can race conditions occur when multiple experiments access shared stats channels or results vectors, causing statistics to be mixed or corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Cross-function: Error propagation] [Silent failures] Do all .unwrap() and .expect() calls properly propagate errors, or could rate limiter test failures be silently ignored allowing buggy code to reach production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Async: read_future and write_future] [Join semantics] Does futures::future::join at line 234 guarantee that both futures complete successfully, or could one future's panic cause the other to be cancelled mid-operation leaving resources in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Async: channel operations] [Deadlock potential] Could the bounded channel with capacity 2 at line 177 deadlock if both read and write futures try to send stats simultaneously while the main thread is blocked elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Async: TcpStream compatibility] [Compat layer safety] Does the .compat() conversion at lines 168 and 187 properly maintain all async semantics, or could impedance mismatches between tokio and futures cause silent data corruption? (Low)",
