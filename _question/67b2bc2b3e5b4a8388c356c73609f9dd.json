  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Fields: max_gas_amount + gas_unit_price] [Gas price manipulation] Can a miner/validator manipulate gas_unit_price after transaction submission but before execution to extract excess fees? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Field: max_gas_amount] [Gas reservation DoS] Can attackers submit many transactions with high max_gas_amount to reserve gas capacity, blocking legitimate transactions from entering mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [All fields] [Deterministic execution] Are all fields used deterministically across validators, or can floating point conversions/rounding cause divergent execution? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Struct: EntryFunctionPayload] [String encoding] Are module_name and function_name UTF-8 validated, or can invalid encodings cause different validators to interpret them differently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Field: args in EntryFunctionPayload] [Argument order] Can argument order in args vector be manipulated to call function with swapped parameters, bypassing intended logic? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Field: secondary_signers] [Signer order] Does order of addresses in secondary_signers matter for authorization, and can reordering bypass multi-sig validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Field: gas_payer] [Payer impersonation] Can gas_payer be set without proper authorization from that account, enabling forced payment attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Field: max_gas_amount] [Underflow in subtraction] When actual gas consumed is subtracted from max_gas_amount for refund calculation, can underflow occur with malformed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/user_transaction_context.rs] [Fields: max_gas_amount * gas_unit_price] [Checked multiplication] Is checked multiplication used when calculating total gas cost, or can overflow silently wrap causing incorrect charging? (Critical)",
