  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_generic_response()] [JSON injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious JSON value through arb_json_value() that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities in process_generic_response(), causing remote code execution on validator nodes processing Vault responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_generic_response()] [Status code spoofing] Does the fuzzer test for status code/body mismatches where a 200 status contains error payloads, potentially bypassing error handling in process_generic_response() and causing silent failures in critical operations?

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_secret_list_response()] [Secret enumeration] Can an attacker exploit the 404 status handling in process_secret_list_response() to distinguish between 'no secrets exist' vs 'access denied', enabling unauthorized secret enumeration? (Medium)",
