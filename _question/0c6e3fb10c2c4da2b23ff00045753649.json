  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Version Mismatch] At lines 132-133, LanguageVersion::latest_stable() and CompilerVersion::latest_stable() are hardcoded - can version mismatches between test and production environments lead to verification passing in tests but failing in production, missing critical vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: in_ci()] [Environment Variable Injection] At line 141, can an attacker manipulate the ENV_TEST_ON_CI environment variable to force tests to behave differently in CI vs local environments, potentially hiding security bugs that only manifest in one environment? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: get_env()] [Empty String Confusion] When environment variable lookup fails and returns an empty string at line 155, can this empty value be confused with a legitimate empty environment variable, causing logic errors in callers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: path_in_crate()] [Path Traversal] The path_in_crate() function at lines 147-152 directly constructs a PathBuf from user input without validation - can an attacker provide '../../../etc/passwd' to access arbitrary files on the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: path_in_crate()] [Relative Path Assumption] The comment at line 145 assumes 'cargo test runs in the root dir of the crate' - can this assumption be violated in containerized or CI environments, causing path_in_crate() to resolve to unintended directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Validation Bypass] The bail!() checks at lines 172-189 prevent certain options from being set - can an attacker bypass these checks by using alternative option names, short forms, or Unicode variations that aren't caught by is_empty() checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Source Path Injection] While move_sources is blocked at line 171, can an attacker inject source paths through other vectors like the target_filter parameter or BuildConfig that bypass the validation but still control which files are verified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Dependency Confusion] The check at lines 178-182 prevents explicit move_deps, but can an attacker exploit the package system to inject malicious dependencies that get implicitly included, allowing verification of attacker-controlled Move code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Address Space Manipulation] While move_named_address_values is blocked at lines 184-188, can dev_mode=true at line 169 allow attackers to manipulate address assignments in ways that bypass verification checks or enable privilege escalation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Error Message Injection] The error messages at lines 172-188 include user-controlled input (options.move_sources[0]) - can an attacker inject ANSI escape codes or format strings in source paths to manipulate terminal output or cause parser confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Model Poisoning] When config.move_model_for_package() is called at line 199, can an attacker provide a malicious package structure that causes the model builder to include unintended modules or exclude critical security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Target Filter Bypass] The target_filter parameter at line 201 is user-controlled - can an attacker craft filter strings with regex injection or glob pattern vulnerabilities that cause security-critical modules to be excluded from verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Version Downgrade] At lines 197-198, unwrap_or_default() allows version to fall back to defaults - can an attacker manipulate BuildConfig to force older, vulnerable compiler or language versions with known verification bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [All Files Target] The all_files_as_targets flag at line 200 is hardcoded to false - could forcing this to true cause excessive resource consumption or verification of unintended test/example code that contains vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Temp Directory Race] When TempDir::new() is called at line 208, can an attacker predict or race the temporary directory creation to inject malicious output.bpl files that get read by subsequent verification steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Directory Creation TOCTOU] Between TempDir creation at line 208 and create_dir_all at line 209, can a symlink attack cause the directory to be created at an attacker-controlled location? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Output Path Injection] When constructing output_path at lines 210-214 using temp_dir.path().join(), can path traversal in 'output.bpl' filename cause the output to be written outside the temp directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Temp Directory Cleanup] The _temp_dir_holder at line 205 relies on RAII for cleanup - if run_move_prover_with_model_v2() panics at line 219, can the temp directory leak sensitive verification data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Concurrent Test Collision] The comment at line 206 mentions 'distinct output.bpl for concurrent execution' - are there race conditions where concurrent tests could still collide on temp directory names, causing verification results to be mixed up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Static Path Security] In non-test mode (line 216-217), output.bpl is written to a static location - can concurrent prover runs cause file corruption or TOCTOU vulnerabilities where an attacker swaps the output file between write and read? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Model Mutation] The model is passed as &mut model at line 219 - can the prover execution modify the model in ways that affect subsequent operations or leak information through the mutated state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Error Writer Injection] The error_writer passed at line 219 is StandardStream::stderr() - can an attacker redirect stderr to capture sensitive verification errors containing source code or vulnerability details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Timing Side Channel] The Instant::now() timing at line 196 and duration calculation at line 235 could leak information about code complexity or verification difficulty - can this timing data reveal details about the verified code structure?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Path Extraction] The file_name() extraction at lines 221-224 could return None - while unwrap_or_default() handles this, can an attacker craft a path where file_name() returns unexpected results causing incorrect output in test reports?
