  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/futures_ordered_x.rs] [Function: push()] [Chunk ordering guarantee] Can an attacker manipulating backup storage cause futures to be pushed in arbitrary order at line 118, breaking the assumption that push order matches chunk sequential ordering, leading to state corruption during restore? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/futures_ordered_x.rs] [Function: extend()] [Batch corruption] When extend() at line 169 is used to add multiple backup chunks, can iterator panic or early return cause only partial batch to be added with non-contiguous indices, breaking chunk sequence integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/futures_ordered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Index comparison] Can integer underflow in index comparison at lines 130 and 139 occur if next_outgoing_index wraps around while OrderWrapper indices are large, causing incorrect equality checks?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/futures_ordered_x.rs] [Function: push()] [Queue flooding] Can pushing millions of futures via push() at line 112 without rate limiting cause next_incoming_index to increment uncontrollably, eventually causing overflow and backup system failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/futures_ordered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Starvation attack] By carefully timing future completion, can an attacker cause poll_next() to always find mismatched indices at lines 130/139, accumulating results in queued_outputs until memory is exhausted? (High)",
