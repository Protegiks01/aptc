  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Version Bypass] Can an attacker craft V7 bytecode with Move 2 features that appear to serialize successfully to V6 but actually lose critical semantic information, leading to incorrect decompilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Deserialization Attack] Does serialize_for_version() handle all edge cases properly, or can malicious bytecode trigger panics or undefined behavior during version downgrade? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Logic Error] If bytecode version is exactly VERSION_6, does the early return prevent unnecessary processing, or could there be a case where VERSION_6 bytecode still needs transformation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the error_explanation() function expose internal file paths or system information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Insecure Permissions] Does write_to_user_only_file() ensure that output files have restrictive permissions (0600), or could disassembled/decompiled Move code be readable by other users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Directory Creation] Does create_dir_if_not_exist() create directories with secure permissions, or could intermediate directories be world-writable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Overwrite] Can an attacker bypass the check_if_file_exists() prompt by using PromptOptions to automatically overwrite critical files without user consent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide bytecode files of unbounded size that cause read_from_file() to exhaust system memory when loading into bytecode_bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] If an attacker provides many large bytecode files via package_path, could the output files fill up the disk, causing system instability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Extension Bypass] Can an attacker provide a file with multiple extensions (e.g., 'malicious.mv.exe') that passes the MOVE_COMPILED_EXTENSION check but causes security issues in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems, can an attacker use '.MV' or '.Mv' extensions to bypass the extension validation check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Empty File] Does the code properly handle empty bytecode files (0 bytes), or could this cause deserialization to panic or enter undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Filename Manipulation] Can special characters in filenames (e.g., newlines, null bytes) cause issues when constructing output_file paths with with_extension()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: print_metadata()] [Type Confusion] If is_script flag is set incorrectly, can deserializing a module as a script (or vice versa) lead to crashes, undefined behavior, or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Type Confusion] Does BinaryIndexedView properly handle the is_script flag to prevent type confusion between Script and Module variants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: decompile_v1()] [Command Injection] Is the --script flag passed to Revela properly validated to prevent command injection if is_script is controlled by untrusted input? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Type Confusion] Does the error message differentiate between 'script' and 'module' based on is_script, and could incorrect classification lead to misleading error messages or wrong code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: print_metadata()] [JSON Injection] Can malicious metadata values containing JSON control characters cause serde_json::to_string_pretty() to produce invalid JSON or enable injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: print_metadata()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can extremely large metadata fields (e.g., very long strings in CompilationMetadata) cause unbounded memory allocation during JSON serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: print_metadata()] [Panic] Does serde_json::to_string_pretty().expect() properly handle all edge cases, or could malformed metadata cause a panic that crashes the CLI? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Integer Division] When calculating code size as bytecode_bytes.len() / 1024, could very small files show 0 kbs, potentially misleading users about actual file sizes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Filter Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the print_code_size filter logic by providing filenames that match the filter criteria to leak information about which modules are being processed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v2()] [Inconsistent Behavior] Does print_code_size work consistently between disassemble_v1() and disassemble_v2(), or could version differences lead to incorrect size reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Information Disclosure] With print_basic_blocks and print_locals set to true, could the disassembler expose sensitive implementation details that aid attackers in finding vulnerabilities? (Low)",
