  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: time] [Timestamp arithmetic] When combining duration_since_epoch with checked! macro for timeout calculations, can overflow in timestamp addition cause incorrect timeout values that break liveness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: mutex + rwlock] [Lock composition] Can code that uses both Mutex and RwLock for different resources create ABBA deadlock scenarios where thread A holds Mutex->RwLock and thread B holds RwLock->Mutex in consensus operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: all] [Error recovery] Since all modules use expect/panic instead of Result, can any panic in infallible utilities be recovered, or does every panic require full validator restart, creating availability vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: all] [Testing coverage] Are production edge cases (Byzantine inputs, extreme values, concurrent access patterns) adequately tested across all modules, or can real-world consensus scenarios trigger unexpected panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: nonzero + math] [Combined usage] When NonZeroUsize! values are used in checked! macro arithmetic (e.g., validator count in quorum calculations), can the non-zero guarantee interact badly with arithmetic checks to produce incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: time + rwlock] [Timestamp caching] If timestamps from duration_since_epoch are cached under RwLock for performance, can stale cached values cause consensus timeouts to trigger incorrectly when system clock is updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Crate architecture] [Panic philosophy] Does the 'infallible' naming imply these operations cannot fail, when they actually panic on invalid input, creating false sense of safety in consensus code that doesn't handle panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: all] [Fuzz testing] Have all infallible primitives been fuzz tested with random Byzantine inputs to ensure panics are truly unrecoverable errors and not exploitable attack vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: mutex + time] [Timeout locks] When Mutex::lock is used with duration_since_epoch for implementing timed operations, can infinite lock waits occur if timeout logic fails, causing permanent deadlock in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: all] [Performance impact] Can the infallible wrappers' panic-on-error approach create performance bottlenecks in hot paths compared to error propagation, affecting consensus transaction throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/lib.rs] [Module: math + mutex] [Protected arithmetic] When arithmetic operations using checked! macro are protected by Mutex, can the atomicity of lock+compute+unlock be violated by panics, leaving mutex poisoned with partial results? (High)"
