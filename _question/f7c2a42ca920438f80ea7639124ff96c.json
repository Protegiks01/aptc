  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Terminal Control Injection] The colored output at lines 229-232 using bold().green() and bold().red() - can an attacker inject ANSI escape sequences through the basedir string to manipulate terminal state or spoof verification results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Module Count Manipulation] The model.get_primary_target_modules().len() at line 233 reports verified module count - can an attacker craft packages where this count is misleading, causing users to believe more modules were verified than actually were? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Success Spoofing] The is_ok() check at line 228 determines the SUCCESS/FAILURE message - can prover errors be suppressed or caught in a way that res.is_ok() returns true even when verification failed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Floating Point Precision] The as_secs_f64() at line 235 could lose precision for very long-running verifications - can this imprecision be exploited in timeout calculations or performance monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run() + run_move_prover()] [Global State Race] Both functions manipulate current directory (line 124-135 and via reroot_path) - can concurrent execution of multiple prover tests cause race conditions where tests interfere with each other's working directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Temp Directory Exhaustion] If multiple tests create TempDirs concurrently, can the system run out of temp directory space or inodes, causing legitimate verification runs to fail and masking real security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Multiple] [Option Passing Chain] Options flow through ProverOptions → Vec<String> → Options::create_from_args() → run_move_prover_with_model_v2() - can data transformations in this chain introduce injection vulnerabilities or option priority issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Dev Mode Bypass] The forced dev_mode=true at line 169 affects address resolution - can this allow verification of code with privileged addresses that wouldn't be valid in production, missing critical access control vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Config Mutation] The BuildConfig is passed to execute() and mutated - can attackers exploit the shared config object to persist malicious settings across multiple verification runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Default Config Attack] BuildConfig::default() at line 131 may have insecure defaults - can these defaults cause verification to skip critical checks or enable dangerous features? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Struct: ProverOptions] [External Subcommand] The external_subcommand attribute at line 22 bypasses normal command parsing - can this allow injection of arbitrary command line arguments that wouldn't normally be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Struct: Prove] [Skip Field] The 'skip' attribute on for_test at line 41 means it's not validated from CLI input - can internal code set this to unexpected values causing security bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Struct: ProverTest] [Unvalidated Strings] The path and options fields store raw strings without validation - can these contain null bytes, excessive length, or malicious content that causes issues in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Unwrap Panic] Line 124 uses expect() for current_dir() - can filesystem permissions or other issues cause this to panic, leaving the process in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Directory Restore Panic] Line 135 uses expect() for directory restoration - if this fails, does the test harness handle it gracefully or could it cause cascading failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Anyhow Error Propagation] The function returns anyhow::Result but uses bail!() macros - can error context be lost in the propagation chain, making security issues harder to diagnose? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Writeln Error] Line 225 uses writeln!() which returns Result<()> wrapped in Ok() - can write failures be silently ignored, causing verification results to be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [reroot_path Integration] The reroot_path() function from base/mod.rs uses unwrap() on set_current_dir() at line 21 of mod.rs - can this panic be triggered by filesystem errors, causing DoS in verification workflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Package System Trust] The move_model_for_package() trusts the package system to provide correct dependencies - can malicious Move.toml files cause inclusion of attacker-controlled dependencies that bypass verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Prover V2 Interface] Calling run_move_prover_with_model_v2() - are there API mismatches or undefined behaviors when passing mutated models or unusual option combinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Memory Exhaustion] Large Move packages could cause model.get_primary_target_modules() to allocate excessive memory - can this be exploited for DoS attacks during verification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [File Handle Leaks] StandardStream::stdout() and stderr() are created at lines 191-192 - are these properly closed in all error paths, or can repeated verification runs leak file handles? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::run()] [Sequential Execution Requirement] The comment at line 123 mentions 'run prover tests sequentially' - what happens if this requirement is violated? Can parallel execution cause resource conflicts or verification corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: run_move_prover()] [Verification Result Caching] If prover results are cached based on package content, can cache poisoning attacks cause stale verification results to be reused, missing newly introduced vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Prover.toml Precedence] Since Prover.toml is loaded before command-line options at line 63-65, can this precedence be exploited to lock users into insecure settings that they cannot override?
