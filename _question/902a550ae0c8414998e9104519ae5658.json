  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Threshold semantics] Does the allowed_consensus_timeouts represent an absolute count or a rate, and can misinterpreting this allow consensus degradation to go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Timeout causation] Does the checker distinguish between legitimate network issues causing timeouts vs malicious validator behavior, or does it penalize all timeout increases equally? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Metric freshness] Can stale metrics (from cached scrapers or old data) cause the checker to validate outdated timeout counts, missing recent consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Severity mapping] Does a score of 50 (failing) vs 100 (passing) properly translate to validator exclusion decisions, or can nodes with score 50 remain in validator sets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Import: prometheus_parse] [Parsing vulnerabilities] Can vulnerabilities in the prometheus_parse crate's Scrape parsing be exploited through malicious metrics endpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Import: get_metric] [Helper function trust] Does the get_metric() helper properly validate returned values, or can it return attacker-controlled data from compromised metric providers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Interface compliance] Does the Checker trait's check() signature enforce sufficient error handling, or can implementations silently fail without reporting issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Type: CheckResult] [Result interpretation] Can CheckResult's evaluation_summary or score be manipulated to change how upstream systems interpret check failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Constant: METRIC] [Metric alignment] Does 'aptos_consensus_timeout_count' accurately reflect actual consensus timeouts, or can implementation changes make this metric meaningless without updating the checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Byzantine tolerance] If <1/3 of validators experience timeout increases within allowed_consensus_timeouts, can they collude to appear healthy while degrading consensus performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Validator rotation] During epoch transitions with validator set changes, can timeout counter resets cause false positives that incorrectly exclude new validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Network partition] Can network partitions cause timeout increases on honest nodes that then fail checks, leading to recursive validator exclusions and total liveness failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Timeout interpretation] Do consensus timeouts indicate safety violations (double-signing risk) or just liveness issues, and does the checker treat them appropriately? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Comment: Lines 22-24] [Metric name hardcoding] The TODO comment notes metric names should come from a unified crate - can metric renames in consensus code break this checker silently without compile-time detection?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: get_consensus_timeouts()] [Closure semantics] Does the result_on_missing_fn closure at lines 50-59 properly capture metrics_round by value, or can lifetime issues cause dangling references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Clippy directive] The #[allow(clippy::comparison_chain)] at line 63 suppresses a warning - does this hide a potential logic error in the comparison chain? (Low)",
