  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: OnDiskStorageConfig] [Skipped Field Manipulation] The data_dir field is marked with serde(skip) at line 96 - can this cause deserialization to leave data_dir uninitialized or with unexpected values, causing path resolution errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Enum: Token] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker provide configuration where Token enum is deserialized as FromConfig but later treated as FromDisk, causing file path interpretation of token strings and potential path injection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Default for OnDiskStorageConfig] [Insecure Default] Does the default implementation at lines 130-138 use a hardcoded path '/opt/aptos/data' that might not have secure permissions, potentially exposing validator keys if defaults are used in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Server Validation] Does the 'server' field undergo validation to prevent injection of malicious Vault URLs, or can attackers redirect validator nodes to attacker-controlled Vault instances to capture tokens and keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Certificate Validation Bypass] When ca_certificate is None, does VaultStorage default to trusting all certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept Vault communications and steal validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: VaultConfig::ca_certificate()] [Certificate Injection] Can read_file() at line 83 be exploited to load malicious CA certificates that trust attacker-controlled certificate authorities, enabling MitM attacks on Vault connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [TTL Manipulation] Can renew_ttl_secs be set to extremely large values (e.g., u32::MAX) to keep leaked tokens valid indefinitely, or to zero to cause denial of service through constant token renewal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [CAS Bypass] Does setting disable_cas to true disable check-and-set operations in Vault, allowing race conditions in concurrent key updates that could lead to use of stale or corrupted validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Timeout Exploitation] Can extremely small connection_timeout_ms or response_timeout_ms values be used to cause denial of service, preventing validators from accessing their keys and halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Timeout Integer Overflow] Can setting timeout values near u64::MAX cause integer overflow when converted to duration types, resulting in effectively infinite timeouts that hang validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Token Panic] At line 178, if read_token() fails, does the .expect() panic expose sensitive error information in crash logs, or can repeated failures be used for DoS attacks on validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [CA Certificate Panic] At line 182, does .unwrap() on ca_certificate() expose CA certificate contents in panic messages, or can malformed certificates cause validator startup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [CAS Logic Inversion] At line 184, the logic 'config.disable_cas.map_or_else(|| true, |disable| !disable)' appears to default CAS to enabled when disable_cas is None - is this inversion correct, or could it cause unexpected CAS behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Error Message Leakage] At lines 156 and 159, do Error::IO error messages include full file paths that could leak filesystem structure information to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Partial Read Handling] If read_to_string() at line 158 reads partial file contents before encountering an error, is the partial buffer properly cleared to prevent leakage of partial token data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [UTF-8 Validation] When read_to_string() decodes file contents as UTF-8, can invalid UTF-8 in token files cause panics or expose raw bytes in error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: VaultConfig::ca_certificate()] [Missing Field Error] At line 82, does ok_or(Error::Missing('ca_certificate')) provide enough context for debugging, or could vague errors allow misconfigurations to go unnoticed in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Error Propagation] When Token::FromDisk fails to read a file, does the error propagate clearly to indicate whether the issue is permissions, missing file, or corrupted content, or could error ambiguity mask security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [String Allocation] When reading large files into String at line 158, is there bounds checking on file size to prevent memory exhaustion DoS attacks by providing paths to huge files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Clone Overhead] At line 113, does cloning the token String create unnecessary copies in memory that could be captured in memory dumps, violating secure secret handling practices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Sensitive Data in Clone] Does the Clone implementation for VaultConfig at line 52 properly handle sensitive token data, or does it create multiple untracked copies that could be leaked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: SecureBackend] [Debug Trait] Does the Debug trait at line 17 prevent accidental logging of sensitive token or namespace data when SecureBackend is printed during debugging? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Empty Path Handling] What happens if self.path is an empty PathBuf - does path() return data_dir itself, potentially treating the entire data directory as the storage file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Canonical Path] Does path() call canonicalize() to resolve '..' and symlinks, or can these be used to escape data_dir even for relative paths? (High)"
