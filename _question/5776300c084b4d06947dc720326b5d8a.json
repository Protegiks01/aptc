  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Access Control] Can a malicious actor provide a forged consensus_key during initialization that doesn't correspond to the my_addr validator, allowing them to sign observations with incorrect authority and bypass validator authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [State Corruption] Is there validation that the provided epoch_state contains valid validator information, or can an attacker inject a malicious epoch_state with manipulated validator sets to control consensus outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the channel buffer size of 1 in qc_update_tx/rx be exploited to cause message drops during high-frequency JWK updates, leading to consensus state desynchronization across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Injection Attack] Does the vtxn_pool parameter get validated before use, or can an attacker provide a compromised VTxnPoolState that routes quorum-certified updates to unauthorized destinations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [State Initialization] Can an attacker exploit the unwrap_or_default() on observed_jwks to force initialization with empty state, causing validators to start consensus from inconsistent initial conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Race Condition] Does the event loop properly synchronize access to states_by_issuer when processing concurrent jwk_updated and local_observation events, or can race conditions cause state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Channel Poisoning] Can a malicious validator flood the rpc_req_rx channel with crafted requests to trigger priority inversion, preventing legitimate quorum-certified updates from being processed and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Epoch Boundary] If jwk_updated_rx receives an update during epoch transition while qc_update_rx has pending messages, can the reset_with_on_chain_state() call orphan in-flight consensus sessions causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Error Handling] When handle_result returns an error, it only logs without halting - can an attacker repeatedly trigger errors to corrupt internal state while the event loop continues processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Observer Initialization] Can an attacker provide malformed UTF-8 in oidc_providers config_url or name to cause observer spawn failures that go undetected, leaving gaps in JWK monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Channel Starvation] With tokio::select! having no fairness guarantees, can a malicious actor continuously send rpc_req messages to starve critical qc_update processing, preventing consensus completion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Resource Leak] If the close_rx channel is never triggered due to a deadlock elsewhere, does the event loop continue indefinitely without cleanup, causing observer threads and channels to leak resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [State Desync] Can concurrent processing of local_observation_rx and jwk_updated_rx for the same issuer cause version number conflicts in PerProviderState, leading to rejected quorum certificates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Replay Attack] Is there protection against replayed jwk_updated messages across epoch boundaries, or can an attacker replay old on-chain states to force rollback of JWK consensus progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Observer Spawn] Can an attacker provide an OIDC provider config_url pointing to a malicious endpoint that returns extremely large JWK sets, causing memory exhaustion when observers fetch and parse them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Observer Spawn] Does the 10-second Duration for JWKObserver polling interval get validated, or can it be manipulated through on-chain configuration to cause excessive API requests or stale data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Observer Communication] Can the local_observation_tx channel (buffer size 100) overflow if observers generate updates faster than the event loop processes them, causing dropped observations and incomplete consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [UTF-8 Validation] When converting provider name and config_url from bytes to UTF-8, can an attacker inject invalid UTF-8 sequences that pass initial validation but cause panics during string operations later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Observer Authorization] Are JWKObserver threads properly isolated per validator, or can observers from one validator interfere with observations from another validator on the same node? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: tear_down()] [Resource Cleanup] Does join_all() on observer shutdown futures properly handle errors or panics, or can a single failing observer prevent other observers from cleaning up their resources? (Medium)",
