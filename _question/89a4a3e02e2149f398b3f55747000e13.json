  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Credential leakage] Can the GitHub token be leaked through error messages or logs when the Authorization header is set, potentially exposing validator configuration repository access to attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: Client::new()] [Authentication bypass] Does the client validate that the token parameter is non-empty before storing it, or can an attacker create a client with an empty token that might bypass authentication checks in subsequent requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Token injection] Can an attacker inject additional headers or manipulate the token string to include newlines or special characters that could alter request behavior or leak credentials to unintended endpoints? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_file()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker provide a path parameter with '../' sequences to delete files outside the intended repository directory, potentially removing critical validator configuration files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Path injection] Does the path parameter sanitization prevent attackers from using URL encoding (%2e%2e%2f) or Unicode normalization tricks to access unauthorized files containing validator private keys or sensitive configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Path traversal] Can malicious path inputs containing '../../' sequences overwrite critical system files in the repository, such as validator identity files or consensus configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_directory()] [Directory traversal] Does the function validate that path inputs don't escape the repository root using techniques like symbolic links or absolute paths to access unauthorized directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Recursive traversal exploit] Can an attacker provide a path starting with '/' or '../' to recursively delete the entire repository or parent directories, destroying all validator configuration data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: post_url()] [URL injection] Does the path parameter get properly encoded when constructing the GitHub API URL, or can attackers inject additional URL parameters or fragments to manipulate API behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_url()] [Branch injection] Can an attacker manipulate the branch parameter in the URL query string to access unauthorized branches containing sensitive validator keys or configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_file()] [TOCTOU race condition] Between get_sha() and the actual delete request, can another process modify the file causing the SHA mismatch, allowing an attacker to repeatedly trigger failed deletions to prevent critical security updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [TOCTOU race condition] As documented in comments, between get_sha() retrieval and the update operation, can a concurrent modification cause the hash to change, allowing an attacker to win a race and inject malicious validator configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Recursive race condition] During recursive directory deletion, can an attacker create new files faster than they're deleted, causing an infinite loop or resource exhaustion on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Race condition exploitation] Can multiple validators simultaneously calling put() for the same configuration file cause non-deterministic updates where some validators get different configuration states, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [TOCTOU read inconsistency] Between checking if content exists and reading it, can the file be deleted, causing validators to operate with missing or stale configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: From<ureq::Response> for Error] [Information disclosure] Does the error conversion leak sensitive information from GitHub API responses (like repository structure or file contents) in error messages that could be logged or exposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_file()] [Silent failure exploitation] When get_sha() returns NotFound error, the function returns Ok(()), potentially masking race conditions or allowing attackers to claim successful deletions of critical files that never existed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_branches()] [Status code bypass] Does the function only check for 200 status, or could 201/202/204 responses be mishandled, causing validators to incorrectly assess repository health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Status code validation] The function accepts both 200 and 201 status codes - can an attacker exploit GitHub API behavior to return unexpected 2xx codes that should fail but are incorrectly accepted? (Medium)",
