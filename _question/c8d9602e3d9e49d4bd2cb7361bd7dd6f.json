  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Performance: Serialization cost] [CPU DoS] Can the BCS serialization/deserialization of TimestampResource be exploited to cause excessive CPU usage in validators processing high transaction volumes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Performance: Read amplification] [I/O DoS] If every transaction reads TimestampResource from state storage, can transaction spamming cause I/O amplification that degrades validator disk performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Performance: Cache efficiency] [Cache pollution] Can malicious access patterns to TimestampResource cause cache pollution in state storage systems, degrading overall blockchain performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Crypto: State commitment] [Merkle proof] Is TimestampResource properly included in the state Merkle tree, and can malicious validators exclude it from state commitment to hide timestamp manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Crypto: Hash consistency] [Deterministic hashing] When TimestampResource is hashed as part of state root calculation, is the hash deterministic across all validators, or can hash variations cause state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Economic: MEV extraction] [Time arbitrage] Can validators with knowledge of future TimestampResource values extract MEV by manipulating transaction ordering relative to time-dependent contract logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Economic: Timestamp trading] [Validator collusion] Can validators collude to manipulate timestamps within consensus bounds to favor specific transactions or contracts for economic gain? (High)",
