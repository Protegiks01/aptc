  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: new()] [API Client Trust] Does CoinClient assume the provided API client is trusted and secure, or could a malicious API client intercept transactions, steal keys, or manipulate responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: CoinClient] [Clone Safety] Is deriving Clone for CoinClient with API client references safe, or could cloning lead to multiple mutable borrows or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: CoinClient] [Debug Exposure] Does deriving Debug for CoinClient expose sensitive information like API client endpoints, credentials, or internal state in debug output? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: CoinClient] [Thread Safety] Is CoinClient thread-safe for concurrent operations, or must it be wrapped in Arc/Mutex for safe concurrent access across multiple threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Sequence Number Management] If transfer() fails after incrementing sequence number in sign_with_transaction_builder(), is there a recovery mechanism or does the account become stuck with unusable sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Transaction Pipeline] Can multiple concurrent transfer() calls with the same from_account create a race condition where transactions are built with conflicting sequence numbers causing all but one to fail? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [API Failures] If api_client methods fail intermittently, can partial state updates (like incremented sequence numbers) leave the system in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Retry Logic] Is there retry logic for failed transfers, and if so, does it properly handle sequence number management to avoid duplicate transfers or sequence gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Error Propagation] Do all error contexts provide sufficient information for proper error handling, or could swallowed errors hide critical failures like insufficient funds or invalid addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Balance Verification] Should transfer() verify sufficient balance via get_account_balance() before submission to prevent guaranteed failures that waste gas and sequence numbers? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Async State] Can async operations be cancelled mid-execution leaving from_account or API client in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Integration] [Transaction Confirmation] Does CoinClient provide methods to wait for transaction confirmation, or must users implement their own polling logic risking timing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [TypeTag Nesting] Can deeply nested type parameters in coin_type exceed Move's MAX_TYPE_TAG_NESTING limit causing parsing failures or VM errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [Generic Type Parameters] Does TypeTag parsing properly handle all generic type parameter combinations for coin types, or are there edge cases that could bypass type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [Module Address] Can attackers provide coin_type with different module addresses than expected to call unintended transfer functions in malicious contracts? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [Function Signature] Does 'transfer_coins' entry function signature match expectations across all Aptos framework versions, or could version mismatches cause transaction failures? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [Resource Type] Does the TypeTag for coin_type properly represent a valid Move resource type with required coin capabilities, or could invalid types bypass coin invariants? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Move Integration] [BCS Encoding] Are BCS-encoded arguments (to_account, amount) guaranteed to match Move function parameter types exactly, or could encoding mismatches cause VM errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Cryptography] [Signature Replay] After sign_with_transaction_builder() creates a signature, can that signature be reused maliciously if the transaction fails and user retries? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Cryptography] [Key Management] Does CoinClient assume LocalAccount securely manages private keys, or could key leakage through unsafe memory handling allow unauthorized transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Cryptography] [Transaction Malleability] Can signed transactions be modified after signing but before submission in ways that change transfer behavior while keeping signature valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Security] [Amount Validation] Is there validation preventing negative amounts (if u64 were to wrap) or detecting overflow conditions that could allow unauthorized fund creation? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Security] [Address Validation] Does AccountAddress validation ensure to_account is a valid, properly formatted address and not a system address or reserved address? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Security] [Access Control] Can transfer() be called by unauthorized users if they obtain a reference to someone else's LocalAccount, enabling account takeover? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Rust Safety] [Mutable Borrowing] Does &mut LocalAccount parameter in transfer() and get_signed_transfer_txn() prevent safe concurrent access patterns that users might need? (Low)"
