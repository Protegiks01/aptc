  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 41-75] [Log Injection] If the output is redirected to log files, can attackers inject fake log entries through crafted database content that gets printed, potentially hiding their tracks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 41-75] [Debug Format Exhaustion] Can the Debug trait implementation for complex types (Transaction, WriteSet, Events) cause excessive CPU usage or memory allocation when printing deeply nested data structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Output Truncation] Does println! properly handle extremely large data structures, or can it truncate output leading to incomplete debugging information that masks issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Read-Write Race] Can a validator commit a new transaction at the requested version between when this tool opens the database and when it reads data, causing inconsistent snapshots across the six queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 41-75] [Interleaved Query Race] Are the six database queries (transaction, auxiliary_info, write_set, events, transaction_info, accumulator_hash) executed atomically, or can database modifications between queries lead to inconsistent data being printed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Snapshot Isolation] Does readonly mode provide snapshot isolation guarantees, or can concurrent writes from the validator cause the tool to read uncommitted or partially-committed data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 41-75] [Checksum Verification] Does the tool verify checksums or integrity proofs of the retrieved data, or can it print corrupted data from a damaged database without warnings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Version Consistency] Can the tool verify that all retrieved data components (transaction, writesets, events, etc.) are actually from the same version, or can database corruption cause mixed-version data to be printed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Merkle Proof Validation] Does the tool validate that TransactionInfo matches the computed hash of Transaction+WriteSet+Events, or can it print inconsistent data that wouldn't pass Merkle verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 70-75] [Accumulator Verification] Can the tool verify that the accumulator root hash correctly commits to the retrieved TransactionInfo, detecting storage corruption or malicious database tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 32-39] [Column Family Access] Does open_dbs() properly initialize all required RocksDB column families, or can missing column families cause queries to fail with confusing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 32-39] [Database Version Mismatch] Can opening a database created with a different AptosDB schema version cause deserialization errors or silent data corruption when reading? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Sharding Distribution] If storage sharding is enabled, can version numbers hash to wrong shards causing the tool to return empty results for existing transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Genesis Version] Can requesting version=0 (genesis) cause special-case bugs since genesis transactions may not have all data types (events, write sets) that normal transactions have? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Reconfiguration Events] Can querying versions that contain reconfiguration events (epoch changes) expose validator set changes, stake distributions, or voting power that should be aggregated before disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Failed Transaction Handling] Do failed transactions (ExecutionStatus::MiscellaneousError) have all the same data fields populated, or can querying failed transactions cause None/missing data to be printed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run()] [Block Metadata Transactions] Can querying BlockMetadata pseudo-transactions (version exists but no user transaction) expose validator block proposal patterns or consensus timing information? (Low)",
