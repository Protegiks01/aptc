  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemRandDb] [Memory exhaustion] Can a Byzantine validator flood the system with unlimited aug_data and certified_aug_data entries since the HashMaps are unbounded, causing memory exhaustion and node crashes that halt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemRandDb] [Memory exhaustion] Does the HashMap storage for aug_data grow indefinitely without pruning old epochs, allowing attackers to cause out-of-memory conditions by generating data across many epochs? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization vulnerability] Does the new() constructor leave InMemRandDb in an uninitialized state with None key_pair and empty HashMaps, creating a window where randomness operations could fail and stall consensus?

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Clone overhead] Does the .clone() operation in get_key_pair_bytes() create unnecessary copies of cryptographic keys in memory, increasing attack surface for memory scanning attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Uninitialized access] Can get_key_pair_bytes() be called before any key pair is saved, returning None and causing consensus components to crash or behave unpredictably? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Data replacement attack] Can a Byzantine validator repeatedly call save_aug_data() with different AugData for the same AugDataId, overwriting legitimate augmented data and corrupting the randomness state?
