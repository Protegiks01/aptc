  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Span Information Loss] Does the function preserve span information for better error reporting, or can conversion errors point to wrong locations in source code? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Title Case] Do title case characters (like ǅ U+01C5) trigger is_uppercase() at line 10, and how are they converted by to_lowercase()? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Caseless Characters] For characters without case like Chinese/Japanese characters, does the is_uppercase() check return false and route them through the else branch correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Double Case] For characters with both uppercase and lowercase variants like Σ/σ/ς (Greek sigma), does to_lowercase() consistently choose the same form? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Case Folding vs Lowercase] Does to_lowercase() implement simple lowercase conversion or full Unicode case folding - can the difference cause security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Maximum Length] What's the maximum output length for pathological inputs with many uppercase letters - can extremely long snake_case names cause stack overflows or compilation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Length Expansion] In worst case (all uppercase), output length is 2*input-1 - can this cause buffer size mismatches or truncation when the output is used in fixed-size contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Single Uppercase] For input 'A', does the function return 'a' correctly, and is this handled properly in downstream macro code expecting longer names? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Thread Safety] Is camel_to_snake() called during parallel compilation - can race conditions in proc-macro execution cause non-deterministic outputs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Caching] Are camel_to_snake() results cached anywhere - can cache poisoning attacks cause incorrect hasher name reuse? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Version Skew] If the Diem framework version and Aptos version implement camel_to_snake() differently, can types using different derive macros produce colliding hasher names? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [First Character Special Case] For input 'ABC', the first 'A' goes through line 13-15 (first=true branch), then 'B' goes through line 10-12 (uppercase branch) - is this transition correct for all inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [First Uppercase Transition] When first=true and c.is_uppercase(), line 10 short-circuits to false, routing to line 13 - is this the intended behavior for uppercase-starting names? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Empty Output Check] Can any input produce an empty string output that would cause invalid static variable declarations like '_SEED'? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Underscore Prefix] Can inputs produce outputs starting with underscores like '_my_type', creating Rust identifiers with special meaning? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Test Coverage] Are there comprehensive tests for camel_to_snake() covering all edge cases, or could untested code paths contain bugs that only manifest with specific type names? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Fuzzing] Has this function been fuzzed with random Unicode inputs to discover edge cases that could cause crashes or incorrect conversions? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Property Testing] Are there property-based tests verifying invariants like 'output never contains uppercase' and 'output is valid Rust identifier'? (Low)",
