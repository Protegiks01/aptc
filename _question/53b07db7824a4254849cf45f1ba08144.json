  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems (Windows, macOS default), can an attacker create packages with names that collide with existing packages when using different cases (e.g., 'Package' vs 'package')? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Drive Letters] On Windows, can package names include drive letters (e.g., 'C:package') that cause files to be created on different drives than expected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [UNC Paths] Can UNC paths (\\\\\\\\server\\\\share) be used in the `path` parameter to create packages on network shares with potentially weaker security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute_with_defaults()] [Default Dependencies] The function hardcodes MoveStdlib dependency at line 35. If the Move repository is compromised, all newly created packages automatically include malicious standard library code. Is there any verification mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute_with_defaults()] [Empty Custom] The empty string passed for `custom` parameter at line 37 means no additional TOML sections. Can attackers exploit this predictability to craft targeted attacks against known package structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Constants: Lines 13-19] [Constant Tampering] Are these constants in .rodata or can they be modified at runtime through memory corruption, causing all new packages to use attacker-controlled URLs and addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Iterator Exhaustion] The `deps` and `addrs` parameters use `impl IntoIterator`. Can lazy iterators with side effects cause security-relevant actions (network requests, file operations) when iterated over? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Iterator Panics] If the iterators for deps or addrs panic during iteration (e.g., due to malicious code in next()), is the partially written Move.toml file left in an exploitable inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Umask Respect] Does file and directory creation respect the user's umask settings, or are permissions hardcoded in ways that could create world-writable files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Filesystem Quota] Are filesystem quotas respected? Can an attacker cause quota exhaustion by creating many packages or packages with extremely large manifests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Temporary Files] No temporary files are used, but if the system crashes mid-write, can partially written Move.toml files cause security issues when the system recovers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Macro Safety] The writeln! macros at lines 61-82 use format strings. Can format string vulnerabilities (though less common in Rust) be exploited through the formatted values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [String Interpolation] Variables are interpolated directly into format strings (e.g., {name}, {version}). Can this cause issues if the variables contain format specifiers or escape sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Disk Space DoS] Can an attacker repeatedly call this function to create thousands of packages, exhausting available disk space and inodes? (Out of Scope - DoS)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [CPU Exhaustion] If the Display implementations for deps or addrs perform expensive computations, can repeatedly creating packages cause CPU exhaustion? (Out of Scope - DoS)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Timestamp Leakage] Do created files and directories have timestamps that could leak information about when packages were created, potentially aiding forensic analysis by attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Username Leakage] Are file ownership records created with the current user's information, potentially leaking usernames or UIDs that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Comment Injection] Can an attacker inject TOML comments through input fields to hide malicious content or confuse automated parsers and security scanners? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Multiline String Injection] Can TOML multiline string syntax (triple quotes) be injected to create values that span multiple lines and inject additional TOML structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Inline Table Injection] Can TOML inline table syntax ({ key = value }) be injected through Display implementations to create complex nested structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Package Publishing] If packages created by this function are later published to a package registry, can malicious manifest content cause issues during publishing or for users who download the package? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Dependency Resolution] Can malicious dependency specifications cause package managers to download dependencies from unintended sources or versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Registry Confusion] Can address mappings or package names be crafted to cause confusion in package registries, allowing attackers to squat on names or shadow legitimate packages? (Medium)"
