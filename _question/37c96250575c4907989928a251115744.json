  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [File System Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit a TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) race condition between check_if_file_exists() and write_to_file() to overwrite critical genesis.blob or waypoint.txt files with malicious content, potentially corrupting the genesis state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [Path Traversal] Does the output_dir path validation properly prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., '../../../etc/genesis.blob'), allowing an attacker to write genesis files to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [BCS Serialization Attack] Can maliciously crafted genesis data cause bcs::to_bytes() to produce non-deterministic output or trigger panics, leading to inconsistent genesis blobs across nodes and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [Mainnet Flag Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the --mainnet flag or its validation logic to generate a testnet genesis with mainnet parameters (or vice versa), potentially bypassing security constraints specific to mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [Waypoint Generation Failure] If generate_waypoint() fails or produces an incorrect waypoint due to corrupted genesis data, can validators start with mismatched waypoints causing permanent network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: GenerateGenesis::execute()] [Prompt Bypass] Can the prompt_options validation be bypassed to silently overwrite existing genesis files without user confirmation, enabling an attacker with filesystem access to corrupt genesis configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [Supply Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Layout.total_supply field in the LAYOUT_FILE to be extremely large (near u64::MAX), and if the sum calculation at line 156 overflows, could this bypass the total supply validation and allow minting of unlimited tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [Balance Mismatch Exploit] If total_balance_supply != total_supply check fails but execution continues due to error handling issues, can validators start with inconsistent initial balances causing double-spending or loss of funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [MIN_USEFUL_AMOUNT Bypass] Can an attacker set account.balance to exactly 0 to bypass the MIN_USEFUL_AMOUNT check at line 169, then exploit zero-balance accounts in genesis to perform attacks or create invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [10% Limit Bypass] Can an attacker split a large balance across multiple accounts to circumvent the ten_percent_of_total validation at line 174, allowing a single entity to control >10% of supply through Sybil accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [Integer Overflow in Division] Can the calculation 'total_supply / 10' at line 167 cause integer overflow or precision loss issues if total_supply is maliciously set, leading to incorrect 10% threshold validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [Duplicate Account Address] Does the AccountBalanceMap conversion properly check for duplicate account addresses, or can an attacker include the same address multiple times with different balances to inflate total supply? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [Root Key Presence Attack] If layout.root_key.is_some() returns true for mainnet at line 142, the error is raised but can an attacker craft a layout that passes this check while still containing root key data elsewhere, enabling unauthorized admin access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_mainnet_genesis_info()] [EmployeePoolMap Parsing] Can malformed employee_vesting_accounts data cause parsing errors that are silently ignored, allowing invalid employee pools to be included in genesis with incorrect vesting schedules? (High)",
