  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Upgrade] [Backward compatibility] During rolling upgrades, can VoteData from updated validators be rejected by old validators even if both follow the same protocol rules? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Upgrade] [Feature flags] If new validation rules are added to verify() behind feature flags, can inconsistent feature flag configuration across validators cause vote rejection and consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Rust safety] [Unsafe code] Does VoteData or its dependencies use any unsafe Rust code that could lead to undefined behavior if memory safety invariants are violated? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Rust safety] [Panic safety] Can any operations on VoteData panic instead of returning errors, allowing Byzantine validators to crash honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Rust safety] [Interior mutability] Does VoteData use any interior mutability patterns (RefCell, Mutex) that could lead to runtime borrow check failures or deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Rust safety] [Lifetime issues] Can lifetime mismanagement cause VoteData references to outlive the data they point to, leading to use-after-free bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Integration] [ProposalGenerator] Can ProposalGenerator create VoteData for proposals that appear valid but will be rejected by other validators' verify() checks due to state differences? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Integration] [RoundManager] Can RoundManager accept VoteData that passes verify() but violates round state machine invariants, causing incorrect round transitions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Integration] [PendingVotes] Can vote aggregation in PendingVotes be manipulated by VoteData with identical hashes but different content, causing incorrect quorum calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Integration] [ValidatorVerifier] Can VoteData be constructed to bypass signature verification even though it passes verify(), allowing unsigned votes to be counted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [BFT] [1/3 Byzantine threshold] Can exactly 1/3 Byzantine validators coordinate their VoteData to break safety while each individual VoteData passes verify()? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [BFT] [Asynchronous network] In asynchronous network conditions, can VoteData arrive out-of-order causing verify() to reject valid votes and break liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [BFT] [Validator equivocation] Does VoteData structure make equivocation (voting for two different blocks at same round) detectable, or can Byzantine validators hide equivocation? (Critical)"
