  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious path via --output-path argument containing '../' sequences to write the OpenAPI spec to arbitrary locations outside intended directories, potentially overwriting critical system files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] If the output_path points to a symbolic link, can an attacker create a symlink to a sensitive file before execution, causing the tool to overwrite that file with OpenAPI spec content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Directory Traversal] Does the write() function validate that the parent directory of output_path exists and is writable, or can it fail silently or create directories in unintended locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permission Issues] When writing to output_path, are proper file permissions set, or could the generated spec file be world-writable, allowing unauthorized modification of the OpenAPI specification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Between checking if output_path exists and writing to it, could a race condition allow an attacker to replace the target with a symlink to a sensitive file (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use vulnerability)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command Injection] If the tool is invoked programmatically with user-controlled arguments, can shell metacharacters in the output path cause command injection when the path is later used in shell scripts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Argument Validation] Does clap's parsing properly validate and sanitize the output_path argument, or can specially crafted paths with null bytes, control characters, or excessive length cause crashes or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Struct: OutputFormat] [Enum Exhaustion] If new format variants are added to OutputFormat enum but not handled in the match statement in main(), can this cause a panic or incorrect spec generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Information Leak] Does the generated OpenAPI spec inadvertently expose internal API implementation details, debug endpoints, or sensitive configuration that should not be public? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Mock Data Exposure] Could the fake context used for spec generation leak information about test environments, development configurations, or internal system architecture in the generated spec? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] If output_path points to a filesystem with limited space, does write() handle disk-full errors gracefully, or can it corrupt the output file or crash? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory Exhaustion] When get_spec() generates the OpenAPI specification, is there a limit on the spec size, or can a maliciously constructed API service cause unbounded memory allocation and OOM crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic on Error] If get_api_service() or get_spec() encounter errors during spec generation, does main() properly handle Result types with ?, or could unhandled panics leak stack traces with sensitive path information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Module: fake_context] [Mock Component Security] Are MockSharedMempool and MockDbReaderWriter properly isolated from real blockchain components, or could their use in spec generation accidentally expose real node data if contexts are mixed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: get_api_service()] [Service Initialization] When creating the API service with fake context, could improper initialization of the context lead to spec generation that includes real node endpoints or production configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [YAML Injection] When generating YAML format specs via get_spec(&api_service, true), could specially crafted API endpoint descriptions or parameters inject malicious YAML that exploits parsers when the spec is later consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [JSON Injection] When generating JSON format specs via get_spec(&api_service, false), could unescaped strings in API descriptions inject malicious JSON structures that cause security issues in downstream spec consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Charset Manipulation] The get_spec() function removes 'charset=utf-8' from content type - could this removal cause encoding issues where non-UTF8 characters in API descriptions lead to misinterpretation or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Escalation] If the tool is run with elevated privileges (e.g., as root), can the output_path be exploited to write specs to privileged locations like /etc/ or system directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [World-Writable Output] Does the write() function inherit umask settings, or could generated spec files be created with overly permissive permissions allowing unauthorized users to modify them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent Execution] If multiple instances of the tool run concurrently with the same output_path, can they corrupt each other's output or cause file locking issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Resource Cleanup] Does get_fake_context() properly clean up MockSharedMempool runtime resources, or can repeated executions leak memory/threads in long-running processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Test: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage] Does the verify_tool() test adequately validate security properties of argument parsing, or could malicious arguments bypass clap validation in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/main.rs] [Module: main] [Binary Security] Is the compiled binary built with security hardening flags (ASLR, stack canaries, PIE) to prevent exploitation if vulnerabilities are discovered? (Low)"
