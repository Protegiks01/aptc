  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Function: path_from_ordered_root()] [Root block inclusion] Line 45 says it excludes the root - can this cause off-by-one errors in commit logic where the root block's transactions are missed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Function: path_from_ordered_root()] [Empty path handling] Does returning Some([]) for the root block (line 45) get confused with None in calling code, causing incorrect state handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/block_storage/mod.rs] [Function: path_from_commit_root()] [Commit vs ordered confusion] Can calling both path_from_ordered_root() and path_from_commit_root() with the same block_id return different paths, causing state inconsistency? (High)",
