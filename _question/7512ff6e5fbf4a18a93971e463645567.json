  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: backoff_policy_base_ms] [Integer Overflow] The default base is 2ms with factor 50 - can computing base * factor repeatedly cause integer overflow in backoff calculation, wrapping to 0 and disabling backoff entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: backoff_policy_factor] [Exponential Explosion] With factor=50 and base=2, does the exponential backoff (2*50^n) grow too aggressively, causing legitimate retries to wait excessively long and degrading liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: backoff_policy_max_delay_ms] [Timing Manipulation] Can a Byzantine node set backoff_policy_max_delay_ms to 1ms (instead of default 3000ms), causing aggressive broadcast retries that flood the network with duplicate messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: backoff_policy_max_delay_ms] [Liveness] If backoff_policy_max_delay_ms is set to u64::MAX, can failed broadcasts effectively never retry, preventing critical consensus messages from propagating and halting the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: rpc_timeout_ms] [Race Condition] If rpc_timeout_ms (1000ms) is shorter than the minimum backoff interval after one retry (100ms), can this create a race where timeouts trigger before retries complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Comment] [Logic Error] The comment says backoff 'starts at 100ms and doubles each iteration' but base=2 and factor=50 computes differently (2*50=100, then 2*50^2=5000 which exceeds max) - does this implementation mismatch cause incorrect backoff behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Validation Missing] There's no sanitization for ReliableBroadcastConfig - can invalid combinations like base=0, factor=0, or max_delay < base*factor cause division by zero or infinite loops in backoff logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Consensus Desync] If validators have different backoff_policy configurations, can this cause message delivery timing inconsistencies leading to different validators committing different blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig, Field: backoff_policy_base_ms] [Zero Value] If backoff_policy_base_ms is set to 0, does the exponential backoff formula degenerate to always 0, causing instant unlimited retries and network amplification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Type Safety] All timing values are u64 measured in milliseconds - can conversions to Duration type in Rust overflow for extreme values, causing panic in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig, Field: adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms] [Timing Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator set adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms to 0, causing premature round progression before all honest validators have prepared proposals, leading to missed blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig, Field: adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms] [Liveness Attack] If adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms is set to u64::MAX, can this freeze round progression indefinitely, causing complete consensus halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig] [Insufficient Validation] There's no sanitization for DagRoundStateConfig - can extreme wait time values cause integer overflow when multiplied by round numbers or validator counts in consensus logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig, Default] [Hardcoded Value] The default 500ms minimum wait time is hardcoded - does this value work for all network conditions, or can high-latency networks suffer from validators timing out before this minimum expires? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig] [Consensus Timing] If different validators configure different adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms values, can this cause timing disagreements where some validators enter new rounds before others, fragmenting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig] [Adaptive Mechanism] The field name mentions 'adaptive' but there's only a single static value - does the adaptation happen elsewhere, and can Byzantine nodes exploit the adaptation algorithm by manipulating timing patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: chain_backoff_config] [Empty Vector] The default chain_backoff_config is Vec::new() (empty) - does this mean no backoff is applied by default, allowing unbounded chain growth to cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms] [DoS] Can a Byzantine node manipulate conditions to consistently exceed voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms (30 seconds), triggering excessive health check failures and causing validator ejection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms] [Liveness] If voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms is set too low (e.g., 10ms), can legitimate processing delays under load trigger false health failures, causing unnecessary validator restarts and consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: pipeline_backpressure_config] [Empty Vector] The default pipeline_backpressure_config is also empty - does this disable backpressure entirely, allowing validators to accept more work than they can process and causing cascading failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig] [Validation Missing] There's no sanitization for DagHealthConfig - can malformed ChainHealthBackoffValues or PipelineBackpressureValues in the vectors cause parsing errors or invalid state during runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig] [Configuration Complexity] ChainHealthBackoffValues and PipelineBackpressureValues are referenced but not defined in this file - can inconsistencies between those types and this config cause type mismatches or deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms] [Integer Overflow] At 30 seconds (30000ms), can multiplication with round numbers or validator counts overflow u64 in health check calculations, causing incorrect health assessments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig, Field: quorum_store] [Dependency Risk] The quorum_store field uses QuorumStoreConfig::default_for_dag() from another module - can mismatches between DAG config and quorum store config cause consensus inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig, Function: sanitize()] [Incomplete Validation] The sanitize() only validates DagPayloadConfig but not fetcher_config, rb_config, round_state_config, or health_config - can invalid values in these configs bypass validation and cause runtime failures? (High)"
