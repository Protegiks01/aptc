  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Derive: Copy] [Memory Safety] Can the Copy trait lead to double-counting fees if a FeeStatement is copied and both copies are processed independently in the fee collection logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Comparison Bypass] Can two FeeStatements be considered equal via PartialEq even if they represent different economic values due to precision loss, enabling transaction replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Derive: Eq] [Hash Collisions] If FeeStatement is used as a key in hash maps, can different economic scenarios hash to the same value due to ignored precision differences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Validation Gap] Is there any validation that (execution_gas_units + io_gas_units + storage_component) <= total_charge_gas_units, or can total be arbitrarily set independent of components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: add_fee_statement()] [Component Drift] After multiple add_fee_statement() calls with precision-loss affected values, can component sum drift arbitrarily far from total_charge_gas_units? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Unit Conversion] The documentation mentions storage_fee_octas must be 'converted to gas units according to gas_unit_price' - can this conversion be manipulated by setting extreme gas_unit_price values in the transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Conversion Overflow] When converting storage_fee_octas to gas units for inclusion in total_charge_gas_units, can the conversion overflow and wrap to a small value? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Asymmetric Accounting] Since storage_fee_refund_octas is in octas but excluded from gas_units-based total, can attackers exploit this asymmetry to get refunds in a different currency/rate than charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: storage_fee_refund()] [Economic Exploit] Can the refund mechanism be gamed where users pay storage_fee_octas at one price but receive refunds at a more favorable exchange rate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Timing] At what point in transaction processing is FeeStatement emitted as an event - before or after clear_refunds() is called? Can this timing be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Replay] Can emitted FeeStatement events be replayed or manipulated in block execution to cause double-charging or fee evasion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Failure Handling] If a transaction fails mid-execution, is the partially-constructed FeeStatement properly handled, or can failed transactions avoid fees while consuming resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Cases] Does new() have any error paths, or can it always succeed even with invalid inputs, allowing malformed FeeStatements to propagate through the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Price Manipulation] The net charge calculation involves 'total_charge_gas_units * gas_unit_price' - can attackers set gas_unit_price to u64::MAX causing overflow in the multiplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Price Volatility] If gas_unit_price changes during block execution (e.g. due to epoch transition), can this cause validators to compute different FeeStatements for the same transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Version Skew] If FeeStatement structure changes in protocol upgrades, can old and new validators disagree on fee calculations during the upgrade period? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module Evolution] If the Move module 'transaction_fee' is upgraded, can this break the Rust-side MoveStructType mapping and cause deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: add_fee_statement()] [Block-STM] In Aptos's parallel execution model (Block-STM), can concurrent modifications to FeeStatement lead to lost updates or inconsistent fee totals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Atomicity] Are updates to all five fields in add_fee_statement() atomic, or can a partially-updated FeeStatement be observed by concurrent readers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: gas_used()] [Reward Distribution] Since gas_used() returns the basis for validator rewards, can manipulation of total_charge_gas_units enable one validator to claim disproportionate rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Reward Theft] Can a malicious validator create FeeStatements with inflated gas_used() values for transactions they propose, stealing rewards from other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: storage_fee_refund()] [Refund Gaming] Can users create and delete storage in a way that maximizes refunds relative to charges, effectively getting free storage usage over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: clear_refunds()] [Refund Loss] Can legitimate storage deletions be censored by calling clear_refunds() improperly, causing users to lose deserved refunds and overpay for net storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type Confusion] Can Move code pass a differently-typed value that deserializes as FeeStatement in Rust, bypassing Move-side type safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Type Confusion] Can events with the same binary format but different semantic meaning be confused with FeeStatement events? (Low)"
