  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Abort logging] Are aborted transaction events properly logged when on_execution_aborted() is called, or can validators silently drop failed transactions without record? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Lock ordering] Can hook implementations acquire locks in an order that conflicts with the block executor's locking strategy, causing deadlocks during parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Concurrent modification] If hooks access shared state, can concurrent invocations from parallel execution cause data races not prevented by the Send + Sync bounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Synchronization overhead] Can hooks that perform synchronous operations (like I/O or network calls) block executor threads and degrade throughput during high transaction volume? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Finality bypass] Can hooks be used to expose uncommitted transaction data to external systems before finality, allowing front-running or MEV attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Double-execution] If on_execution_aborted() fails to properly mark transactions as aborted, can the same transaction be re-executed, potentially causing double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Empty block] Are hooks properly handled for empty blocks with no transactions, or can this edge case cause unexpected behavior like null pointer dereferences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Genesis block] During genesis block execution, are hooks properly initialized and called, or can missing initialization cause crashes during network bootstrap? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Partial block] If block execution is interrupted mid-way, can partially invoked hooks leave the system in an inconsistent state requiring manual recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Trait: TransactionCommitHook] [Version compatibility] Can changes to the TransactionCommitHook interface break compatibility with existing implementations during protocol upgrades, causing validator crashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Fuzz testing] Can fuzzed TransactionOutput values cause hooks to panic or enter infinite loops, indicating insufficient input validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Privacy leak] Can hook implementations leak private transaction information (amounts, recipients) to external systems before transactions are publicly visible on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Timing attack] Can the timing of hook invocations leak information about transaction execution paths, enabling timing-based attacks to extract sensitive data? (Low)",
