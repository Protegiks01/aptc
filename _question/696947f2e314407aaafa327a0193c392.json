  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey in queries] [Query injection] Can malicious EventKey values containing special characters break API query parsing, enabling injection attacks or unauthorized data access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey in queries] [Range query manipulation] Can attackers exploit EventKey ordering to craft range queries that return incomplete or wrong event sets, bypassing pagination limits or accessing restricted events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventHandle::count in pagination] [Count manipulation for pagination] Can malicious actors manipulate EventHandle counts to cause pagination APIs to return duplicate events or skip events when clients fetch event streams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey hash properties] [Preimage resistance] Is the EventKey-to-bytes mapping preimage resistant, or can attackers find colliding EventKeys that serialize to the same bytes enabling event substitution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey hash properties] [Second preimage resistance] Given a legitimate EventKey, can an attacker find a different EventKey with the same hash or serialization to forge events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey structure changes] [Backward compatibility] If EventKey fields are added/removed in a protocol upgrade, can old serialized EventKeys be safely deserialized, or will this cause consensus splits between upgraded and non-upgraded validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventHandle structure changes] [Migration safety] During protocol upgrades that change EventHandle structure, is there safe migration of existing EventHandle counters, or can migration bugs cause event count resets and sequence number collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Size calculation changes] [Storage migration] If the size() calculation changes due to structure modifications, can this cause storage accounting inconsistencies requiring hard forks to fix? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Byzantine validators] [Event forgery] Can Byzantine validators forge events with arbitrary EventKeys claiming to originate from honest accounts, and would these forgeries be accepted by honest validators causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Byzantine validators] [Counter manipulation] Can Byzantine validators report different EventHandle counter values than honest validators for the same event stream, causing disagreement on total event counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Byzantine validators] [Replay attacks] Can Byzantine validators replay old events with historical EventKeys to confuse event stream subscribers or manipulate on-chain indexing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey creation] [Key exhaustion] Can an attacker exhaust the u64 creation_number space by rapidly creating events, eventually preventing legitimate event emission from an account? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventHandle storage] [Storage amplification] Can attackers create excessive numbers of EventHandles to amplify storage consumption beyond gas payments, enabling economic denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Event data size] [Large event payloads] While not in this file, can the EventKey/EventHandle structures be exploited to reference extremely large event payloads that consume excessive storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey with zero values] [Zero creation_number] Can EventKey be created with creation_number=0, and does this cause any special behavior or conflicts with uninitialized default values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey with zero values] [Zero address] Can EventKey be created with AccountAddress::ZERO, and could this conflict with system-reserved event streams or null object patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventHandle with zero count] [Zero-count handles] Can EventHandles exist with count=0 indefinitely, and does this represent valid state or an uninitialized handle that should be rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Maximum values] [u64::MAX handling] How is u64::MAX handled for both creation_number and count fields - does reaching maximum value brick the event system for that account permanently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventKey type safety] [Type substitution] Can EventKey be unsafely transmuted to other types of the same size (like u128 or [u64;2]) to bypass type checking and create malformed keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [EventHandle type safety] [Phantom types] Should EventHandle use phantom type parameters to ensure type safety of events at compile time, and does the current implementation allow type confusion? (Low)"
