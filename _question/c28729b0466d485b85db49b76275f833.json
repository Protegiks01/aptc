  "[File: types/src/move_utils/as_move_value.rs] [Function: Vec<T>::as_move_value()] [Empty Vector Edge Case] Does converting an empty Vec<T> create a valid MoveValue::Vector that the Move VM can handle correctly, or could empty vectors cause unexpected behavior in Move code that doesn't anticipate them? (Low)",
