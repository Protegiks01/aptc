  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Validation bypass] Can attackers craft Metadata that passes check_metadata_format() validation but causes runtime failures in get_metadata() when cached metadata is later deserialized? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Cache poisoning] Can malicious Metadata entries poison the V1_METADATA_CACHE or V0_METADATA_CACHE thread-local caches, causing incorrect metadata to be returned for legitimate modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Duplicate key exploitation] Can attackers exploit the duplicate key check to force check_metadata_format() to return MalformedError::DuplicateKey for legitimate modules with valid but similar keys? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Unknown key rejection] Does the UnknownKey error in check_metadata_format() cause transaction failures for modules with harmless future metadata extensions, breaking forward compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Deserialization error] Can crafted Metadata cause DeserializedError in check_metadata_format() after module publication, leaving the module in an invalid state requiring hard fork to fix? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Module complexity attack] Can attackers include Metadata that increases module complexity metrics beyond COMPLEXITY_BUDGET, causing ModuleTooComplex errors that prevent legitimate governance upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Integration] [Version confusion] Can mixing V0 and V1 metadata keys in the same module cause version confusion in get_metadata(), returning incorrect metadata structures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Serialization] [BCS encoding attack] Can attackers exploit BCS encoding ambiguities where different Metadata structs serialize to identical byte sequences, causing hash collisions in module identification? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Serialization] [Serialization size] Does BCS serialization of Metadata correctly compute and enforce size limits, or can oversized metadata bypass storage quota checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Serialization] [Endianness] Are there endianness issues in key/value byte vectors that could cause Metadata to deserialize differently on different architectures, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Serialization] [Serialization determinism] Is BCS serialization of Metadata deterministic across all Rust versions and platforms, or could subtle differences cause validators to compute different module hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Storage] [Storage amplification] Can metadata with small keys but huge values cause storage amplification attacks, consuming disproportionate on-chain storage for minimal transaction fees? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Consensus] [Non-deterministic execution] Can differences in Metadata processing (e.g., due to different cache states) cause validators to execute transactions non-deterministically, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Consensus] [Metadata-dependent gas] If gas metering depends on Metadata contents (e.g., checking attributes), can attackers craft metadata that causes different validators to compute different gas costs? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Consensus] [Upgrade attacks] Can attackers publish modules with Metadata that exploits version upgrade logic, causing validators running different software versions to disagree on module validity? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [State machine] [State transition] Can Metadata cause non-deterministic state transitions during module publication if error_map or attribute extraction depends on external state? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Gas] [Gas exhaustion] Can attackers craft modules with minimal code but massive Metadata, bypassing gas limits since metadata size may not be adequately metered? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/metadata.rs] [Gas] [Gas underpricing] Is the gas cost of processing large Metadata during module publication properly accounted for, or can attackers publish modules cheaply that later cause expensive cache operations? (High)",
