  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Progress race] If multiple threads simultaneously update the parent pruner's progress after sub-pruner completion, can race conditions in progress recording cause the system to believe pruning completed when it actually failed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Batch size coordination] If implementations use different batch sizes or pruning strategies, can parallel execution cause memory pressure or uneven resource consumption leading to validator performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Version zero] Can implementations handle current_progress = 0 and target_version = 0 without panicking or entering infinite loops during genesis state pruning attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Maximum version] Can implementations handle Version::MAX as target_version without integer overflow when computing ranges or iterating through versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Empty range] When current_progress equals target_version, do implementations correctly handle the empty range without attempting to prune or corrupting progress metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Reverse range] If called with current_progress > target_version (despite being invalid), can implementations detect and reject this instead of corrupting state by pruning forward from the higher version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Gap handling] If there are gaps in version history (missing transactions), can implementations handle non-contiguous version ranges without panicking or entering infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Large range] Can implementations efficiently handle very large version ranges (e.g., billions of versions) without exhausting memory by loading all data into memory at once? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Off-by-one] Can off-by-one errors in implementations cause pruning to include or exclude boundary versions incorrectly, leading to either over-pruning (data loss) or under-pruning (policy violation)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Deterministic pruning] Does the trait guarantee deterministic pruning behavior across all validators, or can non-deterministic implementations cause validators to have different historical data affecting state sync? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [State proof] If implementations prune historical state needed for generating Merkle proofs, can this prevent new validators from syncing properly causing permanent network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Checkpoint data] Can implementations accidentally prune data required for checkpoint generation, preventing fast sync mechanisms and forcing full sync from genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Archive node] For archive nodes that shouldn't prune, can implementations be misconfigured to still prune data, causing loss of historical data required for auditing and compliance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Reconfiguration] During epoch reconfiguration, can pruning interfere with state snapshot creation or validator set updates causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [State divergence] If implementations have bugs causing non-deterministic pruning, can validators end up with different provable states even though they haven't pruned committed transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Error propagation] Does the Result<()> return type ensure that all pruning errors are properly caught and handled, or can implementations suppress errors leading to silent pruning failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Panic safety] Can implementations panic during pruning operations, leaving database writes uncommitted and causing inconsistent state that requires manual recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Retry logic] If prune() returns an error, can retrying the operation cause double-deletion attempts, corrupted indices, or divergent error states across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Disk full] When disk space is exhausted during pruning metadata writes, can implementations leave the database in an inconsistent state where data is deleted but progress isn't recorded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Corruption recovery] If database corruption is detected mid-pruning, do implementations have recovery mechanisms or do they propagate corruption by continuing to prune? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Graceful degradation] Can implementations detect when pruning would violate safety constraints (e.g., pruning active validator data) and gracefully skip those ranges instead of failing entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Initialization order] Can the order in which sub-pruners are initialized cause some to have stale progress while others are caught up, leading to inconsistent historical data views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: name()] [Progress tracking collision] If two implementations return the same name(), can progress metadata get overwritten causing one sub-pruner to skip pruning or re-prune already pruned data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Trait: DBSubPruner] [Dependency ordering] If sub-pruners have implicit dependencies (e.g., transactions must be pruned before events), can parallel execution violate these dependencies causing referential integrity violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/db_sub_pruner.rs] [Method: prune()] [Batch coordination] When LedgerPruner calls all sub-pruners with the same version range, can different batch sizes in implementations cause some to lag behind others creating temporary inconsistency? (Medium)"
