  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs] [Function: run()] [Pruner Ordering] Does the tool verify that different pruner types (Event, Transaction, WriteSet, etc.) maintain consistent relative progress? Could an attacker selectively advance certain pruners to delete evidence of malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs] [Function: run()] [Shard-Level Inconsistency] Within a single pruner type, different shards can have different progress (lines 136-144). Could an attacker exploit this to create inconsistent pruning states that violate storage invariants? (Medium)"
