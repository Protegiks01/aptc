  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Binary Integrity After Download] After update_binary() completes at lines 132, 151, 172, is there any verification that the downloaded binary matches expected hash values before it's used, or could partial downloads or corruption lead to execution of malformed binaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [GitHub API Rate Limiting Bypass] Can an attacker exploit GitHub API authentication or rate limiting weaknesses in update_binary() to cause the installer to download binaries from attacker-controlled GitHub releases or alternative endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: execute()] [Concurrent Installation Race] When execute() calls download_dependency().await at line 217, can multiple concurrent installations of prover dependencies create race conditions where different installation processes interfere with each other, causing corrupted binaries or inconsistent environment variable state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Multi-Binary TOCTOU] Between installing boogie at line 132, z3 at line 152, and cvc5 at line 173, can an attacker exploit the time window to modify previously installed binaries or environment variables, causing inconsistent prover tool versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Async Cancellation Safety] If the async download_dependency() function is cancelled or panics between binary installations (lines 122-173), can this leave the system in an inconsistent state with only some prover tools installed and environment variables partially set? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: install_binary()] [Directory Lock Missing] When creating DependencyInstaller instances at lines 189-199 for multiple tools, is there any locking mechanism to prevent concurrent writes to the same install_dir, potentially causing file corruption or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Constants: BOOGIE_EXE, Z3_EXE] [DLL Hijacking Attack] On Windows, when installing boogie.exe (line 34) or z3.exe (line 43), does the installer validate that no malicious DLLs are present in the installation directory or PATH that could be loaded by these executables through DLL search order hijacking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Constants: *_EXE] [Executable Extension Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the conditional compilation that sets different executable extensions on Windows vs Unix (lines 33-36, 42-45) to bypass security checks by supplying executables without the .exe extension on Windows or with wrong extensions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Windows PATH Pollution] When setting environment variables for boogie.exe and z3.exe on Windows through add_env_var(), can an attacker exploit Windows PATH resolution behavior to cause the system to execute identically-named malicious executables from higher-priority PATH locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Partial Installation State] If install_binary() fails for z3 at line 151 after successfully installing boogie at line 132, does the function rollback the boogie installation, or does it leave the system in an inconsistent state with only partial prover dependencies installed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Error Propagation Weakness] When check_version_is_compatible() returns an error at lines 116, 135, or 156, does the error properly propagate to prevent subsequent installation attempts, or could partial error handling allow installation of incompatible tool versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: install_binary()] [Eprintln Error Hiding] At line 204, critical errors from add_env_var() are only printed with eprintln!() instead of being propagated as errors - can this allow the installation to appear successful while environment variables are incorrectly set, causing silent failures in later prover operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Context Error Information Leak] Do the .with_context() calls at line 111 leak sensitive information about the file system structure or installation paths in error messages that could help an attacker map the system? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Constants: REPO_OWNER, REPO_NAME] [Hardcoded Repository Hijacking] The hardcoded REPO_OWNER='aptos-labs' and REPO_NAME='prover-dependency' at lines 27-28 create a single point of failure - if these values are somehow mutable or can be influenced by environment variables, could an attacker redirect downloads to a malicious repository? (Critical)",
