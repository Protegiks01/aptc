  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Message ordering attack] Can a Byzantine validator send multiple CommitNotification messages out of order with non-monotonic block_timestamps to cause inconsistent state across ProofCoordinator, ProofManager, and BatchGenerator components, potentially leading to batch replay or double-inclusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Batch data manipulation] Can an attacker craft a CommitNotification with malicious BatchInfoExt entries containing manipulated digest, num_txns, or num_bytes fields that pass through to ProofCoordinator, ProofManager, and BatchGenerator without validation, causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Timestamp manipulation] Does the CommitNotification handler validate that block_timestamp is monotonically increasing, or can a malicious validator send decreasing timestamps causing time-travel attacks in ProofManager and BatchGenerator expiration logic? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Batch vector injection] Can an attacker send a CommitNotification with an empty batches vector or extremely large batches vector (millions of entries) to cause resource exhaustion when cloned three times for ProofCoordinator, ProofManager, and BatchGenerator? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Clone amplification DoS] Does the triple cloning of batches.clone() on lines 62, 69, and 77 create memory amplification vulnerabilities where a single large batch vector consumes 3x memory, potentially causing OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Race condition in commit notifications] Can concurrent CommitNotification messages arrive while previous sends are still pending on .await, causing message interleaving where ProofCoordinator receives commit N+1 before ProofManager receives commit N, breaking ordering guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Channel backpressure bypass] Can an attacker flood CommitNotification commands faster than components can process them, causing unbounded queue growth in the mpsc channels before the .expect() panic is triggered? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Partial delivery failure] If proof_coordinator_cmd_tx.send() succeeds but proof_manager_cmd_tx.send() fails with expect panic on line 72, does this create inconsistent state where ProofCoordinator has processed the commit but ProofManager has not? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Byzantine batch injection] Can a Byzantine validator include BatchInfoExt entries in CommitNotification for batches that were never actually committed to storage, causing ProofManager and BatchGenerator to reference non-existent batches? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Epoch confusion attack] Can an attacker send CommitNotification with BatchInfoExt entries from different epochs mixed together, causing cross-epoch batch confusion when distributed to ProofCoordinator, ProofManager, and BatchGenerator? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Duplicate batch entries] Does CommitNotification validation prevent duplicate BatchInfoExt entries in the batches vector, or can an attacker include the same batch multiple times causing double-processing in downstream components? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Async cancellation safety] If the start() future is cancelled/dropped mid-execution between sending to ProofCoordinator and ProofManager, can this leave components in inconsistent states with only partial commit notifications delivered? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Counter manipulation] Can an attacker spam CommitNotification messages to artificially inflate the QUORUM_STORE_MSG_COUNT counter on lines 57-59, potentially masking actual metrics or triggering alert fatigue? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Expiration bypass] Can an attacker send CommitNotification with BatchInfoExt entries that have already expired (expiration < block_timestamp) to cause ProofManager to store expired batches that should have been pruned? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Author spoofing] Does CommitNotification validate that BatchInfoExt.author() matches actual validator identities, or can an attacker include batches attributed to other validators causing reputation/stake slashing issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Shutdown ordering violation] Can an attacker send Shutdown command while CommitNotification messages are still in-flight in component channels, causing components to shutdown before processing critical commits leading to data loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Network listener shutdown race] Can the NetworkListener shutdown on lines 93-107 race with incoming VerifiedEvent messages, causing messages to be dropped or processed after shutdown acknowledgment is sent? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Double shutdown vulnerability] If Shutdown command is received twice (via multiple coordinators or race conditions), can the second shutdown attempt cause panics or deadlocks when trying to send through already-closed channels? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Shutdown deadlock] Can circular dependencies in shutdown ordering cause deadlock where NetworkListener waits for ProofManager acknowledgment but ProofManager is waiting for NetworkListener to close its sender? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Oneshot channel leak] If any component panics during shutdown before sending on its oneshot acknowledgment channel, does the .expect() on await (lines 107, 117, 133, 146, 156) cause the coordinator to hang indefinitely?
