  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: create_non_empty_group_data_view()] [Integer underflow] Can an attacker cause integer underflow when universe_size < 3, since the function accesses key_universe[(universe_size - 3)..universe_size] without validating minimum size, potentially causing panic or memory corruption in test setup that masks production bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: create_non_empty_group_data_view()] [Insufficient test coverage] Does the hardcoded selection of last 3 keys as group_keys adequately test edge cases where group keys appear at different positions in the key universe, potentially missing vulnerabilities in production code related to group key positioning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: create_non_empty_group_data_view()] [Test isolation failure] Does the delayed_field_testing flag being set to false in all test invocations mean critical delayed field vulnerabilities in resource groups could go undetected in production block executor code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: create_non_empty_group_data_view()] [Boundary condition] Are there missing tests for universe_size == 3 (minimum valid size), which could hide off-by-one errors in group key selection logic that could cause state corruption in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: create_non_empty_group_data_view()] [Key collision] Does the test framework verify that group_keys don't collide with regular transaction keys, or could key collisions in production cause resource group corruption that tests don't catch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Race condition] In the parallel execution loop (lines 60-87), can race conditions between block_stm_v2 true/false iterations cause inconsistent test state that masks concurrency bugs in the production block executor? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Gas limit bypass] The special case 'if *maybe_block_gas_limit == Some(0) && i > 0' (line 63) skips execution - could this hide vulnerabilities where zero gas limit causes unexpected behavior in production that only manifests after first iteration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Determinism violation] Does running num_executions_parallel iterations with the same txn_provider truly test for non-determinism, or could subtle state leakage between iterations hide non-deterministic execution bugs that cause state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Thread pool reuse] Does reusing executor_thread_pool across multiple test iterations (lines 68-80) risk state pollution between runs that could mask thread-safety bugs in the production parallel executor?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Sequential execution isolation] The sequential execution loop (lines 90-121) creates a new guard each iteration but reuses executor_thread_pool - could this incomplete isolation hide bugs where sequential execution state leaks affect subsequent runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: run_tests_with_groups()] [Error handling bypass] The sequential execution error handling (lines 113-120) only checks ResourceGroupSerializationError - could other error types be silently ignored, hiding critical vulnerabilities in production error paths?
