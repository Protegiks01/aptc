  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Serialization] [Gas Log Size] Is there a limit on the serialized size of TransactionGasLog, or can attackers create multi-megabyte logs that exceed network message limits or storage quotas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Serialization] [Deterministic Encoding] Do all validators serialize gas logs identically, or can differences in serialization libraries or versions cause divergent state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Enum: FrameName] [Script vs Function] Can attackers craft transactions that appear as Script in the entry point but contain Function calls internally, bypassing script-specific validation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Attack] [Gas Log Poisoning] Can a malicious validator inject false gas events into gas logs during block proposal to cause other validators to calculate different gas totals and reject the block? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Attack] [Selective Event Logging] Can attackers selectively omit certain types of gas events (e.g., CallNative or LoadResource) from the log while still executing the operations, underreporting actual gas usage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Attack] [Retroactive Cost Modification] After gas events are logged, can the cost fields be modified before assert_consistency is called, allowing post-execution gas manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Attack] [Parallel Execution Race] In parallel execution environments, can race conditions cause gas events from different transactions to be interleaved in the same CallFrame, corrupting gas accounting? (High)",
