  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Test code] [Mock network context] The NetworkContext::mock_with_peer_id() at line 192 - if mock functions are accidentally used in production, can this bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Test code] [Test timeout assumptions] The test at lines 210-215 assumes 1-second timeout is sufficient - can this create flaky tests that hide real timing bugs in validator discovery? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Eclipse attack] [Targeted address filtering] Can an attacker who controls a validator's on-chain config selectively provide different addresses to different peers, isolating specific validators from the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Sybil attack] [Unlimited peer creation] Since there's no limit on PeerSet size at line 150, can an attacker add millions of fake validators to exhaust memory and connection resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Replay attack] [Stale ValidatorSet replay] If an attacker can replay old ReconfigNotification messages, can they cause validators to revert to outdated peer sets and disrupt consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] [Config verification gap] Between payload.get() at line 72-74 and actual use of extracted peer_set, can the on-chain state change such that the PeerSet becomes stale or invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Metadata manipulation] [ValidatorInfo field manipulation] The ValidatorInfo at line 118 contains consensus_pubkey, addresses, and voting_power - can attackers manipulate non-address fields to affect validator selection while keeping addresses valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Boundary condition] [Zero validator scenario] If ValidatorSet becomes empty due to mass slashing or governance attack, does extract_validator_set_updates return empty PeerSet causing network halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Boundary condition] [Maximum PeerId size] The peer_id from account_address() at line 119 - can extremely large account addresses cause allocation failures or overflow checks in downstream code? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Cryptographic edge case] [HashSet collision] If x25519::PublicKey hashing in HashSet has collisions, can different keys hash to same value causing contains() at line 47 to false-positive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Cryptographic edge case] [Key encoding variants] If x25519 keys can be encoded in multiple formats (compressed/uncompressed), can validators use different encodings causing comparison failures? (High)",
