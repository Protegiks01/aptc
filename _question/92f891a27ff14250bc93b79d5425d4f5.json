  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Waypoint Constant Hardcoding] Are the hardcoded MAINNET_GENESIS_WAYPOINT and TESTNET_GENESIS_WAYPOINT constants verified against actual network state, or can they become stale/incorrect after network upgrades causing bootstrap failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Local Config Override] Does the check for local_execution_config_yaml['genesis_waypoint'].is_null() properly handle all YAML null representations, or can attackers use alternative null encodings to bypass the override prevention? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Version Check Bypass] Can an attacker set base.waypoint.version() to exactly GENESIS_VERSION (0) to prevent automatic waypoint injection, then later modify it to participate in consensus with incorrect genesis state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Return Value Confusion] Does calling code properly handle the Ok(true) vs Ok(false) return values to detect config modifications, or can silent failures in optimization go unnoticed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: concurrency_level] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker set concurrency_level to u16::MAX (65535) to allocate excessive thread pools causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: concurrency_level] [Zero Concurrency Attack] If concurrency_level is set to 0 (supposed to use default), does the fallback calculation handle edge cases like num_cores=0 or can it result in zero actual concurrency causing transaction processing deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: concurrency_level] [Resource Starvation] Can a malicious validator intentionally set concurrency_level=1 to severely bottleneck transaction execution while still appearing online, degrading network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: concurrency_level] [DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL] Is the constant value of 32 appropriate for all hardware configurations, or can attackers exploit validators with fewer cores to exhaust CPU resources with the default setting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: num_proof_reading_threads] [Thread Exhaustion] Can setting num_proof_reading_threads to u16::MAX cause thread pool exhaustion separate from concurrency_level, creating proof reading bottlenecks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: concurrency_level] [Consensus Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators coordinate to use different concurrency_level values to create subtle timing differences in transaction execution, potentially breaking determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_verification] [Safety Bypass] If paranoid_type_verification is disabled, can attackers craft Move transactions that violate type safety invariants (e.g., treat u64 as address) to corrupt blockchain state or steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: paranoid_hot_potato_verification] [Hot Potato Exploit] Without paranoid_hot_potato_verification, can malicious Move code duplicate or destroy hot potato values improperly, breaking linear type guarantees and causing state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_verification] [Performance Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions with deeply nested type structures that, when paranoid_type_verification is enabled, cause exponential verification time leading to validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: paranoid_hot_potato_verification] [Resource Leak] If hot potato verification fails during transaction execution, does the system properly rollback all state changes, or can partial application of hot potato operations corrupt resource accounting?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: async_runtime_checks] [Check Bypass] If paranoid checks are performed asynchronously after commit, can a validator commit invalid transactions before async checks detect violations, causing irrecoverable state corruption?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: blockstm_v2_enabled] [Version Mismatch Attack] Can validators run with different blockstm_v2_enabled settings (some v1, some v2) causing divergent transaction execution results and chain splits? (Critical)",
