  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Remove Without Upsert] Can an attacker remove all OIDC providers without adding any new ones, completely disabling keyless authentication for the entire Aptos network until another governance proposal adds providers back? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Provider Replacement] When Upserting an existing provider with a new config_url, does the operation properly remove old JWKs and fetch new ones, or can stale JWKs from the old URL remain valid, allowing authentication with revoked keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Remove Timing] If a provider is removed with keep_observed_jwks=false immediately after users have obtained tokens from that provider, does this cause authentication failures for those users even though their tokens were valid at issuance time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Enum: OidcProviderOp] [Operation Ordering] Does the order of operations in the ops vector matter (e.g., Remove then Upsert vs Upsert then Remove for the same issuer), or can operation reordering by attackers or network delays cause unintended state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Conditional Logic] Is the if !keep_observed_jwks condition at line 71 susceptible to boolean logic errors, or can negation bugs cause JWKs to be removed when they should be kept or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Error Context] Does the anyhow::Result provide sufficient error context when generation fails, or can cryptic errors make it difficult to diagnose why proposal generation failed, potentially hiding security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Panic Safety] Can any of the operations (string formatting, vector operations, CodeWriter methods) panic instead of returning errors, causing the release builder tool to crash unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Match Exhaustiveness] Is the match statement at line 51 exhaustive for all OidcProviderOp variants, or can future variants added to the enum cause compilation failures or runtime panics if not handled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Dependencies] Does the function properly pass the jwks module dependency to generate_governance_proposal at line 37, or can missing dependencies cause the generated Move script to fail compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Closure Capture] Does the closure at lines 38-43 properly capture the ops and signer_arg variables, or can ownership/borrowing issues cause compilation failures or incorrect code generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Return Value Usage] Can callers of this function misinterpret the Vec<(String, String)> return value, especially since it only contains one tuple, potentially causing proposal submission failures if multiple proposals are expected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [OIDC Spec Compliance] Does the code enforce that issuer strings are valid OIDC issuer identifiers per RFC 8414, or can non-compliant issuers break interoperability with standard OIDC clients? (Medium)",
