  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Integration: Verification Scope] [Scope Boundary Bypass] When verify_scope is set to exclude certain modules, can attackers exploit scope boundaries to call unverified code from verified modules, bypassing security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Validation: num_instances] [Zero or Negative Instances] Can num_instances be set to 0 or overflow to negative values, causing verification to be skipped or produce undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Validation: borrow_natives Format] [Invalid Native Name Injection] Are strings in borrow_natives validated for proper module::function format, or can malformed entries cause parser exploits or verification bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Validation: report_severity] [Severity Enum Integrity] Can report_severity be deserialized into invalid Severity values that cause the prover to crash or mishandle diagnostic reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Field: resource_wellformed_axiom] [Deprecated Feature Active] Is the deprecated resource_wellformed_axiom field completely ignored in current code, or could legacy code paths still process it and introduce unsound verification assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Backwards Compatibility] [Old Config Migration] When loading old configuration files that don't have new security-critical fields, does deserialization use secure defaults or potentially insecure legacy behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Thread Safety: GlobalEnv] [Concurrent Option Access] Are concurrent reads of ProverOptions through get() safe when another thread might be calling set(), or could this cause data races in the GlobalEnv extension system? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Thread Safety: Rc<ProverOptions>] [Reference Counting Race] Is Rc<ProverOptions> safe for concurrent access across multiple verification threads, or could reference count manipulation cause use-after-free vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Concurrency: sequential_task] [Parallel Verification Race] When sequential_task is false, are all ProverOptions accesses properly synchronized to prevent race conditions during parallel verification of multiple contracts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [State Transition: Option Modification] [Mid-Verification Changes] Can ProverOptions be modified via set() while verification is actively running, causing inconsistent verification state and potentially allowing malicious contracts to pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [State Management: Extension Lifecycle] [Option Persistence] Are ProverOptions properly cleaned up after verification completes, or could stale options persist and affect subsequent verification runs with different security requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Error Handling: unwrap()] [Panic on Missing Options] If get() calls unwrap() on a missing extension, does this cause a panic that could be triggered by malicious code to DoS the verification service? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Error Handling: Deserialization] [Malformed Config Handling] When deserializing invalid ProverOptions from configuration files, does the prover fail safely with clear errors, or could it continue with partially deserialized and insecure settings? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Invariant: AutoTraceLevel Logic] [Boolean Logic Consistency] Do the verified_functions(), functions(), and invariants() methods maintain logical consistency, or could certain AutoTraceLevel values cause contradictory trace settings? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Invariant: Option Independence] [Field Dependency Violations] Are the 21 ProverOptions fields truly independent, or do hidden dependencies exist where changing one field requires corresponding changes to others to maintain verification soundness? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Documentation: Security Implications] [Undocumented Security Impact] Are the security implications of each ProverOptions field adequately documented, or could developers unknowingly configure options that disable critical verification checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Documentation: Deprecation Warning] [Deprecated Field Usage] Is the deprecation of resource_wellformed_axiom clearly communicated to prevent its use, or could legacy documentation lead developers to enable this unsound option? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Dependency: move_model] [Upstream Vulnerability] If VerificationScope from move_model has vulnerabilities in scope determination, could this allow ProverOptions to be configured with scopes that exclude critical security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Dependency: Severity] [Diagnostic Severity Manipulation] Could vulnerabilities in the codespan_reporting::diagnostic::Severity type allow manipulation of report_severity to hide critical verification errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/options.rs] [Testing: stable_test_output] [Production Test Leakage] Are there adequate safeguards to prevent stable_test_output from being enabled in production verification, which could make verification behavior predictable to attackers?
