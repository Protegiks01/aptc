  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Overall architecture] The inspection service has no authentication, rate limiting, or request validation - can this design be exploited by sophisticated attackers to map the entire Aptos validator network, identify targets for consensus attacks, and coordinate multi-validator Byzantine attacks to exceed the 1/3 BFT threshold? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 50-101] [Service exposure] Given that the inspection service exposes configuration, identity, peer information, metrics, and system details without authentication, does this service represent a critical information disclosure vulnerability that violates the security assumptions of the Aptos BFT consensus model by enabling attacker reconnaissance? (Critical)"
