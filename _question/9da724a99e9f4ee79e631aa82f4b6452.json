  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] Does the Result error type properly surface all underlying errors from WorkspaceCommand::run(), or could error information be lost that would help diagnose security issues in the workspace services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async runtime] Is the tokio::main macro configured with appropriate thread pool settings, or could resource exhaustion in the async runtime cause the local test network to hang or behave unpredictably? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command injection] Does clap::Parser properly sanitize command-line arguments passed to WorkspaceCommand::parse(), or could malicious command-line input exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] If WorkspaceCommand::run() panics instead of returning an error, could this leave Docker containers or other resources in an inconsistent state without proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async context] Does the tokio runtime properly handle cancellation and shutdown signals, or could abrupt termination leave test network resources (ports, Docker containers, volumes) orphaned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource leaks] If the async main function is interrupted or killed, are there any resource cleanup handlers, or could this leak system resources across multiple test runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error logging] When WorkspaceCommand::run() returns an error, is the error properly logged with sufficient context, or could security-relevant failures go unnoticed during development? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/main.rs] [Macro: tokio::main] [Runtime configuration] Does the tokio::main macro use default settings, or should it specify custom worker threads, stack sizes, or other parameters to prevent resource exhaustion during intensive testing? (Low)"
