  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Hardware Wallet Detection Bypass] Can the `is_hardware_wallet()` check be bypassed to force software key generation even when a hardware wallet is connected, weakening security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Ledger Downgrade Attack] If `aptos_ledger::get_public_key()` fails with an error, does the fallback logic allow an attacker to force the use of a weaker key derivation method? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Display Verification Bypass] When `false` is passed to `get_public_key(..., false)`, does this skip user verification on the Ledger device, allowing attacks where users don't confirm the displayed address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Derivation Path Persistence] Is the stored `profile_config.derivation_path` validated on subsequent uses, or can an attacker modify the config file to use a different derivation path than what the user selected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Account Enumeration] Does displaying multiple Ledger accounts (index 0-4) leak information about which accounts have been used or funded, enabling targeted attacks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Network Mismatch] If `--rest-url` is provided with a non-custom network, the error check prevents it, but can an attacker bypass this by manipulating the network enum value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: custom_network()] [URL Scheme Attack] Does URL validation enforce HTTPS for mainnet/production endpoints, or can an attacker downgrade to HTTP for easier MITM attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Faucet URL Override] When `self.faucet_options.faucet_url` is provided for non-custom networks, the check rejects it, but can this validation be bypassed through race conditions or option manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: custom_network()] [Empty URL Handling] When user input is empty and there's no existing URL, does `custom_network()` return an error or allow proceeding with a None value that could cause null pointer issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Testnet Faucet Bypass] The code sets `profile_config.faucet_url = None` for testnet unless auth token is set, but can an attacker manually set a malicious faucet URL in the config file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Command Injection via read_line] Can an attacker inject shell commands through `read_line()` input that get executed during profile name processing or other string operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Buffer Overflow in read_line] Does `read_line()` impose length limits on user input, or can an attacker cause buffer overflow or memory exhaustion with extremely long input strings? (High)",
