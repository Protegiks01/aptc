  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: state_root_proof endpoint] [Proof computation] Does state_root_proof(version) for very old versions require traversing the entire Merkle tree history, creating an attack vector for expensive historical queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: BytesSender channel] [Backpressure handling] With MAX_BATCHES=100 and TARGET_BATCH_SIZE=10KB, the max buffered data is ~1MB - is this sufficient to handle network latency spikes, or can it cause premature blocking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: flush_buffer()] [Flush failure] If blocking_send() fails during flush_buffer(), the error is converted to AptosDbError but the original cause might be lost - can this hide critical network or resource issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: abort_on_error()] [Error swallowing] The abort_on_error function ignores errors from finish() and abort() with let _res = - can this hide important error conditions that should propagate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/bytes_sender.rs] [Function: BytesSender::send_res()] [Blocking in async] Using blocking_send() in a potentially async context - can this cause deadlocks if called from within a tokio async context? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: BackupHandler usage] [Arc cloning] BackupHandler is cloned multiple times for each endpoint - does this create memory overhead, and are Arc references properly dropped to avoid leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bytes_sender()] [Handler clone] The BackupHandler clone passed to spawn_blocking() - is the underlying AptosDB reference Arc-based preventing use-after-free issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: state_snapshot_chunk endpoint] [Empty state] If start_idx points beyond the available state items, does the iterator return gracefully empty results or cause an error that could be exploited for information disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: transactions endpoint] [Zero transactions] Requesting transactions(version, 0) with num_transactions=0 - does this cause division by zero, empty iterator issues, or other edge case bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: epoch_ending_ledger_infos endpoint] [Same epoch] Requesting epoch_ending_ledger_infos(N, N) for the same start and end epoch - is this handled correctly, or can it cause off-by-one errors in iteration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: LATENCY_HISTOGRAM] [Failed requests] The latency histogram records all requests including failures - does this create monitoring blind spots where slow failures are hidden by fast successful requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: THROUGHPUT_COUNTER] [Incomplete transfers] The throughput counter increments on send but doesn't track delivery confirmation - can this create false metrics if clients disconnect mid-transfer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/mod.rs] [Function: all endpoints] [BCS version] Are all endpoints using a consistent BCS serialization version, or can upgrades cause backup format incompatibilities breaking restore operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bcs_bytes()] [Deserialization compatibility] If the backup service is upgraded but clients use old versions, can BCS format changes cause silent deserialization failures or data corruption? (Medium)"
