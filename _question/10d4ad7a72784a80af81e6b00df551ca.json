  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft transactions that cause the value field to exceed max_value through concurrent add operations, bypassing the limit check and causing supply inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: set()] [Access control] Does the set() method allow direct manipulation of aggregator values without checking max_value constraints, enabling attackers to arbitrarily set supply values and mint unlimited tokens?
