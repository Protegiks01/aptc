  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Change Set Configs Race] If change_set_configs is modified concurrently between SystemSessionChangeSet::new() (line 73) and UserSession::new() (line 79), can this cause inconsistent validation of prologue vs user changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Non-Deterministic Gas Version] If vm.gas_feature_version() can return different values across validator nodes at line 59, can this cause consensus failures where validators execute different code paths (new vs legacy) for the same transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Change Set Ordering] Does finish_with_squashed_change_set() guarantee deterministic ordering of write operations in the change set, or can different ordering across validators cause state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Resource Group Cache Non-Determinism] Can release_resource_group_cache() produce non-deterministic results across validators (e.g., due to timing, hash map iteration order) causing different gas calculations or state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: new()] [Session ID Determinism] Does SessionId::prologue_meta() guarantee identical session IDs across all validators for the same transaction, or can non-deterministic components (timestamps, random values) cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Storage Write Limit Bypass] Can prologue operations exceed max_bytes_all_write_ops_per_transaction limits defined in ChangeSetConfigs, causing state bloat or storage DoS while bypassing transaction-level limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [State Key Collision] Can prologue change sets contain StateKey collisions with user transaction changes, causing overwrites or lost updates when change sets are merged and committed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Merkle Tree Corruption] If prologue changes modify state that affects Jellyfish Merkle tree structure, can this cause tree corruption or proof verification failures when user transaction changes are applied? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: new()] [Null/Invalid VM Reference] Can an attacker pass a null, dangling, or invalid vm reference to PrologueSession::new() causing memory safety violations or segmentation faults during session creation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: new()] [Malformed Transaction Metadata] If txn_meta contains malformed or oversized fields (e.g., extremely long script_hash, invalid expiration_timestamp_secs), can this cause buffer overflows or integer overflows in session creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Config Parameter Validation] Are change_set_configs validated for consistency (e.g., max_bytes_per_write_op <= max_bytes_all_write_ops_per_transaction), or can invalid configs cause incorrect validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Epilogue Bypass via Prologue] Can malicious prologue changes modify transaction metadata or gas meter state in ways that bypass epilogue execution or allow transactions to commit without proper finalization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/prologue.rs] [Function: into_user_session()] [Authentication Bypass] Can the SystemSessionChangeSet returned at line 78 contain state changes that bypass authentication checks, allowing unauthorized transactions to execute as system operations?
