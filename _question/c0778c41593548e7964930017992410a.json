  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/blocking_txns_provider.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Allocation] In BlockingTxnProvider::new(), can an attacker specify extremely large num_txns values causing vec![OnceCell::new(); num_txns] to allocate massive memory and DoS validator nodes through OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/blocking_txns_provider.rs] [Function: set_txn()] [Panic Exploit] Does the expect() call in set_txn() line 23 expose validators to DoS if an attacker can trigger duplicate set operations on the same index, causing validator crashes during parallel execution? (High)",
