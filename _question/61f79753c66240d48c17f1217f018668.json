  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [FFI boundary violation] At FFI boundaries with C/C++ code, can external functions return zero values that get converted to NonZeroUsize without validation, violating the non-zero invariant? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Lifetime issues] Can lifetime issues cause NonZeroUsize values to be constructed from references to values that get deallocated or zeroed during their lifetime, creating invalid NonZeroUsize instances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Option<NonZeroUsize> confusion] Can code confuse Option<NonZeroUsize> with NonZeroUsize, accidentally extracting None values that get implicitly converted to zero before being passed to the macro? (Medium)"
