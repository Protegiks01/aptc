  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Unwrap panic] All point conversions use .unwrap() - if deserialization fails (e.g., invalid curve points), will this panic crash validator nodes during VK initialization, causing denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Decimal precision] The decimal string coordinates could have precision loss - can rounding errors in string-to-field conversion create slightly different points that break pairing equation consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [VK commitment] The VK points are not cryptographically committed to the circuit - can an attacker replace the circuit without updating the VK, creating a mismatch where proofs verify but represent wrong computations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Trusted setup attack] If the original trusted setup ceremony for this VK was compromised and someone retained the toxic waste, can they forge arbitrary proofs for this verification key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [VK rotation] If the on-chain VK is rotated via governance but code still references this hardcoded test VK, can attackers exploit nodes using stale VK to validate transactions that should be rejected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Pairing precomputation] PreparedVerifyingKey does pairing precomputation - if this precomputation has bugs, can an attacker craft proofs that pass the precomputed checks but fail full verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 32-36] [Alpha_g1 coordinate overflow] The alpha_g1 x-coordinate '20491192805390485299153009773594534940189261866228447918068658471970481763042' is near field modulus - can overflow during arithmetic operations cause the point to wrap and land in a weak subgroup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 38-48] [Beta_g2 Fq2 validation] The beta_g2 point uses Fq2 coordinates with two field elements each - is there validation that these form a valid Fq2 element (i.e., second component isn't zero when it should be)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 50-60] [Gamma_g2 generator] If gamma_g2 is set to the G2 generator or a small multiple of it, can an attacker exploit the known discrete log to break the proof system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 62-72] [Delta_g2 duplicate] If delta_g2 equals beta_g2 or gamma_g2, does this create a degenerate verification key where certain proofs verify incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 74-88] [Gamma_abc_g1 iteration] The for loop iterates over hardcoded point arrays - can an attacker exploit the fact that this creates a fixed-size vector to submit proofs with wrong numbers of public inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Lines 90-96] [VerifyingKey construction] The VerifyingKey struct construction doesn't validate internal consistency (e.g., gamma_abc_g1 length matching circuit) - can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Line 98] [PreparedVerifyingKey conversion] The conversion from VerifyingKey to PreparedVerifyingKey could fail - is there error handling, or will .from() panic on invalid input? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Struct: Groth16TrapdoorSetup] [Trapdoor exposure] The Groth16TrapdoorSetup struct publicly exposes simulation_pk (trapdoor) - if this is ever used in production, can an attacker use the trapdoor to forge proofs for arbitrary JWTs and steal all keyless accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Predictable RNG] The StdRng::seed_from_u64(999) uses a hardcoded, predictable seed - can an attacker reproduce this exact RNG sequence to derive the trapdoor and forge proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Trapdoor leak] The trapdoor is stored in a static variable accessible throughout the codebase - can an attacker trigger code paths that inadvertently log or transmit the simulation_pk, exposing the trapdoor? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Lazy initialization race] The Lazy::new() for TEST_GROTH16_SETUP could have race conditions during first access - can concurrent threads cause double initialization with different trapdoors, leading to verification inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Production usage] If TEST_GROTH16_SETUP is accidentally referenced in production transaction validation code, does this allow attackers to forge signatures using the known trapdoor? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Circuit agnostic setup] The circuit_agnostic_setup_with_trapdoor(&mut rng, 1) creates setup for only 1 constraint - is this correct for the actual keyless circuit which likely has thousands of constraints? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [VK cloning] The vk.clone() operation clones the verification key - can this introduce subtle differences between the original VK and cloned VK due to floating point or precision issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Unwrap panic] The .unwrap() on setup result will panic if RNG or setup fails - can an attacker trigger conditions that cause this panic during static initialization, preventing validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Memory safety] The static Lazy holding trapdoor material stays in memory for process lifetime - can an attacker with memory access exploit this to extract the trapdoor via side channels or memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Line 107] [Seed determinism] Using seed_from_u64(999) means the trapdoor is identical across all nodes/runs - does this violate the assumption that test trapdoors should be unique per test instance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Line 108-109] [Setup parameter mismatch] If the '1' parameter in circuit_agnostic_setup doesn't match the actual circuit complexity, will proofs generated with this setup verify against real circuit VKs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g1_projective_str_to_affine] [String injection] Can an attacker inject malformed decimal strings (e.g., '0x123', '1e10', 'NaN', 'Infinity') to bypass field element parsing and create invalid G1 points? (High)"
