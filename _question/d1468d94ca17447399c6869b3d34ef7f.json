  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Epoch number validation] Does the code verify that new epoch number is exactly old_epoch + 1, or can skipped epochs or epoch rollbacks cause consensus state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Validator set transition] During validator set changes between epochs, can Byzantine validators exploit the transition window to double-sign or equivocate without being caught? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Config change atomicity] Are all config changes (consensus, execution, randomness) applied atomically, or can partial config updates cause consensus to operate with mixed configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Epoch boundary blocks] Can blocks proposed at exact epoch boundary be processed with wrong epoch's configs, causing state divergence between validators and observers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Reconfig notification ordering] If multiple reconfig notifications are queued, can processing them out of order cause observer to skip epochs or apply wrong configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Error logging only] Since config extraction errors are only logged without propagating (lines 159, 171, 185, 199), can critical config failures go unnoticed allowing consensus to proceed with unsafe defaults? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Default config safety] When consensus config fails to load and default is used, are the default values consensus-safe, or can they violate safety invariants like minimum validator count or quorum thresholds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Cascading failures] If validator set extraction succeeds but consensus config fails, can the mismatch between valid validators and default consensus rules cause immediate consensus deadlock? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Execution config corruption] When execution config uses default_if_missing(), can this silently disable critical security features like gas limits or maximum transaction size checks?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Async cancellation] If the async task executing wait_for_epoch_start() is cancelled mid-execution, can partial state updates leave ObserverEpochState in inconsistent state requiring restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Mutex contention] Can high contention on the block_payloads Mutex cause consensus observer performance degradation, delaying block processing and causing observer to fall behind? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Reconfig stream starvation] If reconfig_events stream is slow or blocked, can consensus observer become stuck waiting at await, missing critical epoch transitions and halting observation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Arc clone overhead] With frequent epoch_state() calls cloning Arc, can reference counting overhead cause performance issues in high-throughput scenarios affecting consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Payload store sync] Can block_payloads BTreeMap become desynchronized with actual network state, causing observers to report incorrect payload availability for consensus blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Config propagation delay] Is there delay between extracting configs and them taking effect in payload managers, creating windows where wrong configs are applied to new epoch blocks?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Struct: ObserverEpochState] [NodeConfig mutability] If NodeConfig is mutable and changed externally, can this cause observer configs to drift from actual network configs over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Validator set size] Can extracted ValidatorSet contain zero validators or exceed maximum count, causing verifier creation to fail or voting thresholds to be unachievable?
