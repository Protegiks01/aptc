  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Subscriber cleanup] When subscribers are removed via swap_remove(), are their channels properly closed, or can unclosed channels accumulate and leak memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Partial delivery] If broadcast() fails to send to some subscribers due to TrySendError::Full, can this cause inconsistent view of network state across different applications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Event cloning] Does event.clone() for each subscriber cause performance issues for large ConnectionMetadata, and can this be exploited for DoS during rapid peer churn? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Struct: PeersAndMetadata] [Trust enforcement] Is there enforcement that only trusted peers can be in peers_and_metadata, or can untrusted peers connect and be tracked without validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Trust checking] Does insert_connection_metadata() verify the peer is in trusted_peers before accepting the connection, or is trust checking done elsewhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Metric staleness] How frequently is average_ping_latency_secs updated, and can stale latency data cause persistent mis-routing of consensus messages to slow peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: update_peer_monitoring_metadata()] [Metric bounds] Are there upper/lower bounds on latency values, or can a peer report negative or impossibly large latencies to manipulate sorting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization race] If multiple threads call methods on PeersAndMetadata before new() completes initialization of all networks, can this cause missing_network_metadata_error for valid networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: new()] [Cache initialization] Is the initial cache update at line 83-84 atomic with network initialization, or can concurrent readers observe partially initialized state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Byzantine peer isolation] If up to 1/3 of validators are Byzantine and manipulate their ConnectionMetadata, PeerMonitoringMetadata, and ConnectionState, can the honest nodes detect and isolate them, or will the Byzantine nodes disrupt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Overall Architecture] [State consistency] Under what conditions can peers_and_metadata, cached_peers_and_metadata, and subscriber views diverge, and can this divergence be exploited to cause network partition during epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Notification completeness] If applications rely on NewPeer/LostPeer notifications for security-critical decisions (like validator set membership), what happens when notifications are dropped due to NOTIFICATION_BACKLOG overflow during network storms? (Critical)"
