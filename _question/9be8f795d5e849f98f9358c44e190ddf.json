  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Struct: InspectionServiceConfig] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker exploit the default address binding '0.0.0.0' to expose inspection endpoints to external networks, potentially leaking sensitive validator configuration, identity information, and peer data to unauthorized parties? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_configuration] [Information Disclosure] If expose_configuration is set to true on mainnet validators through configuration manipulation before sanitization runs, could attackers access full node configuration including private keys, consensus secrets, or network topology information? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_identity_information] [Privacy Violation] Can the expose_identity_information flag leak validator private keys, peer IDs, or cryptographic material that could be used to impersonate validators or decrypt encrypted messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_peer_information] [Network Attack] Does expose_peer_information expose the complete validator network topology, allowing attackers to map out all validators and their connections for targeted DDoS, eclipse attacks, or network partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_system_information] [Resource Exhaustion] Can expose_system_information reveal detailed system metrics (CPU, memory, disk) that enable attackers to time resource exhaustion attacks during peak load periods when validators are most vulnerable? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Sanitizer Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the mainnet validator configuration check by manipulating the chain_id parameter to None, allowing them to expose sensitive configuration on production validators without triggering the sanitizer error? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Type Confusion] Does the sanitizer properly validate that node_type.is_validator() cannot be manipulated through NodeType enum variants, or could an attacker register as a different node type (e.g., PublicFullnode) while actually running validator logic to bypass sanitization? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Race Condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where an attacker can pass sanitization with expose_configuration=false, then modify it to true before the service starts, exposing mainnet validator configuration? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Logic Error] The sanitizer only checks mainnet validators - can testnet validators with valuable stakes or mainnet fullnodes with sensitive data expose configuration without restriction, creating information disclosure vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [ChainId Validation] Can an attacker forge or manipulate the ChainId to make it return false for is_mainnet() when actually on mainnet, bypassing the expose_configuration restriction and leaking validator secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Configuration Override] Does the optimizer's automatic enabling of all endpoints for non-mainnet nodes override explicit user-set privacy preferences in local_config_yaml, forcing exposure of sensitive information against operator intent? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [YAML Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious YAML structures into local_config_yaml that exploit serde_yaml parsing to manipulate the is_null() checks, forcing endpoints to be enabled even when explicitly disabled? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Chain Migration Attack] If a testnet node is migrated to mainnet without config regeneration, will the optimizer have already enabled all exposure flags that persist across the chain ID change, exposing mainnet validator data? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Boolean Logic Flaw] The optimizer checks local_inspection_config_yaml['expose_configuration'].is_null() - can an attacker set the value to an empty string or other truthy-but-null-equivalent value to trigger auto-enablement while bypassing intended restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [State Modification] Does the optimizer mutate node_config without proper locking, allowing race conditions where multiple threads read/modify expose_* flags simultaneously, leading to inconsistent security states? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: randomize_ports()] [Port Collision] Can randomize_ports() select a port already in use by another critical service (consensus, mempool, API), causing service failures or creating port binding race conditions that crash validators? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: randomize_ports()] [Predictable Randomness] Does utils::get_available_port() use cryptographically secure randomness, or can attackers predict port assignments to preemptively occupy ports and prevent inspection service startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: randomize_ports()] [Resource Exhaustion] If randomize_ports() is called repeatedly in a loop or during repeated config reloads, can it exhaust available ports or create dangling port reservations that prevent legitimate services from binding? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [Network Exposure] The default address '0.0.0.0' binds to all interfaces - can this expose inspection endpoints to untrusted networks if firewall rules are misconfigured, leaking validator data to attackers? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [Fixed Port Attack] The default port 9101 is predictable - do mainnet deployments change this default, or can attackers scan for validators on this known port to enumerate the network and launch targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Insecure Default] The default configuration sets expose_identity_information, expose_peer_information, and expose_system_information to true - if a validator deploys with defaults on mainnet, does this immediately leak critical information? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Configuration Inheritance] Can the Default implementation be invoked unexpectedly during deserialization errors or missing config fields, reverting to insecure defaults that expose validator information? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Fail-Open Security] If NodeConfig deserialization fails partially, does it fall back to Default values that enable information exposure, creating a fail-open security model rather than fail-closed? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Deserialization Bypass] Can an attacker craft a YAML config with unknown fields that should be rejected by deny_unknown_fields, but exploit serde_yaml parser bugs to inject malicious configuration values? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Type Confusion] Can malformed YAML cause serde to deserialize boolean expose_* fields as non-boolean types (integers, strings), leading to unexpected coercion or parsing errors that enable exposure? (Medium)"
