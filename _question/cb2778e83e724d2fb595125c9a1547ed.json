(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/challenge.rs] [Struct: RotationProofChallenge] [Cryptography] [Weak Randomness] Does the creation of RotationProofChallenge rely on any random values, and can predictable randomness allow attackers to pre-compute valid challenges? (High)",
