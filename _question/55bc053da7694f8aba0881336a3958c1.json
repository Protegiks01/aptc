  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: build_locally_verified_module()] [Verification ordering] Is check_natives() called after or during verify_module_with_config(), and can this ordering be exploited to bypass certain verification checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: build_verified_module_with_linking_checks()] [Link-verify ordering] Does linking verification happen before or after Module::new() constructs internal data structures, and can incorrect ordering cause partially constructed modules to be used? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: flush_all_caches()] [Network-wide cache sync] When one validator flushes caches, do other validators need to flush too for deterministic execution, and what happens if validators have divergent cache states? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Struct: RuntimeEnvironment] [Cache checkpoint] Is there a mechanism to checkpoint and restore cache state at epoch boundaries, and can cache state divergence across epochs cause consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: get_module_bytes_override()] [Feature flag race] Can the enable_enum_option and enable_framework_for_option flags be changed mid-execution, causing some transactions to see one module version and others to see another?
