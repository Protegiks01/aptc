  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Proof: Missing Range] Can gaps in proof ranges allow incomplete state restoration that passes validation but is missing critical data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Proof: Proof Replay] Can old valid proofs be replayed to overwrite newer state, causing state rollback attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Error: Silent Failure] Can Result errors be silently ignored in closures passed to IO_POOL.join(), causing partial failures to go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Error: Panic Recovery] If a panic occurs during add_chunk() within IO_POOL thread, is there recovery logic to prevent the entire restore operation from aborting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Error: Partial Write Recovery] If write_kv_batch() at line 122 partially succeeds then fails, is there rollback logic to prevent inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Error: Error Propagation] Do all Result<()> return types properly propagate errors up the call stack, or can errors be swallowed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Consistency: KV vs Tree Divergence] Can tree_restore and kv_restore become out of sync if one succeeds and the other fails during parallel execution at line 251? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Consistency: Progress Mismatch] Can kv_restore progress and tree_restore progress diverge by more than one chunk, indicating lost data or double-processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Consistency: Version Consistency] Can StateValueRestore and JellyfishMerkleRestore be initialized with different version numbers, breaking state version consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Consistency: Usage vs Actual Storage] Can StateStorageUsage calculations diverge from actual storage space used if key_size() or value_size() return incorrect values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Consistency: Atomic Commit] Are tree and KV commits atomically coordinated, or can crash between commits leave divergent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [RestoreMode: KvOnly Verification Failure] In KvOnly mode, can lack of tree restoration prevent Merkle proof verification for the restored state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [RestoreMode: TreeOnly Query Failure] In TreeOnly mode, can lack of actual KV data prevent state queries even though tree structure exists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [RestoreMode: Mode Change Attack] Can restore_mode be changed mid-restore to create hybrid state where some chunks are KV-only and others are tree-only? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [RestoreMode: Default Mode Overhead] In Default mode, does double-processing of chunks (line 250-251 comment) create opportunities for timing attacks or resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_restore/mod.rs] [Progress: Stale Progress] Can get_progress() return stale progress that hasn't been flushed to disk, causing chunks to be reprocessed after restart? (Medium)"
