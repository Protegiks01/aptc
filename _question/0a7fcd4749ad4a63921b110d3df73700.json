  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Max Gas vs Actual Gas] If max_gas is set much higher than actual gas used, is the excess gas refunded or can attackers waste user funds by setting artificially high limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Struct: TransactionArgs] [Gas Estimation Manipulation] When gas is estimated by server, can an attacker manipulate on-chain state (e.g., deep contract call stacks) to cause underestimation, leading to failed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Multiple Commands] [Command Chaining] Can an attacker chain CreateAccount -> Transfer -> SetOperator in rapid succession to exploit state transitions before on-chain state updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Multiple Commands] [Atomic Execution] Is there a way to ensure multiple commands execute atomically, or can partial execution lead to inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Multiple Commands] [Cross-Command Replay] Can transaction data from one command type be replayed as another type (e.g., Transfer replayed as CreateAccount) to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Currency Symbol Validation] Does the Currency type validate symbol length and character set, or can extremely long or special-character symbols cause buffer overflows or parsing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [Metadata Injection] Can attackers inject additional metadata fields in Currency JSON that get persisted on-chain and later exploited by other systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Non-Native Currency] The comment says 'Only the native coin is allowed for now' (line 131) - is this enforced? Can attackers specify non-native currencies that get incorrectly processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetOperatorCommand::execute()] [Operator Self-Removal] Can an operator use SetOperator to remove themselves, potentially locking the stake pool in an inoperable state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Voter Revocation] Can setting new_voter to a known burn address (e.g., 0x0) be used to permanently revoke voting rights as a griefing attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Negative Commission] While commission_percentage is u64, can it be set to values that overflow when calculated as percentages, causing negative effective commissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [All Commands] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit transactions with extremely long profile names, URLs, or addresses that cause excessive memory allocation in the CLI? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: parse_currency()] [JSON Parsing Memory] Can deeply nested or extremely large JSON currency strings cause memory exhaustion during serde parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [All Commands] [Log Exhaustion] The info! log calls (lines 108, 167, 221, 274, 333) - can verbose logging be exploited to exhaust disk space or cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: private_key_options (all commands)] [Key Material Validation] Does extract_private_key validate that the private key is actually a valid Ed25519 key, or can malformed keys cause crashes or unexpected signing behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: private_key_options (all commands)] [Multi-Sig Bypass] Are multi-signature accounts properly handled, or can single-key commands be used to bypass multi-sig requirements? (Critical)"
