(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Concurrency] [Atomic Operations] Should load_imbalance_tolerance be an AtomicF32 to ensure atomic updates, or could partial writes on some architectures cause corrupt f32 values? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [System Integration] [Block-STM Compatibility] Does the partitioning strategy created by this config interact correctly with Block-STM's optimistic concurrency control, or could it create false conflicts that reduce parallelism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [System Integration] [State Commitment] If different shards process vastly different numbers of transactions due to poor load_imbalance_tolerance settings, could this cause merkle tree computation imbalances that delay state commitment?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [DoS] [Partition Explosion] Can setting load_imbalance_tolerance to very small values (e.g., 0.01) cause the partitioner to create millions of tiny groups, exhausting memory and CPU during partition creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [DoS] [Computational Complexity] Does the partitioner's computational complexity scale with 1/load_imbalance_tolerance, and could adversarial values cause O(n²) or worse behavior? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [DoS] [Cache Thrashing] Could pathological partition sizes created by poor load_imbalance_tolerance values cause CPU cache thrashing that degrades overall validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Consensus] [State Root Divergence] If different validators calculate different group_size_limit values due to floating-point differences, will they produce different state roots for the same block, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/connected_component/config.rs] [Consensus] [Deterministic Execution] Is there any scenario where the same load_imbalance_tolerance value could produce non-deterministic partitioning due to HashMap iteration order or other sources of non-determinism? (Critical)",
