  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Dependency confusion] Can an attacker exploit the dependency on aptos_indexer::runtime::bootstrap to inject malicious code if the dependency resolution is compromised? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Option<Result> conversion] In the pattern match that converts Option<Result<Runtime>> to Result<Option<Runtime>>, can the None => Ok(None) branch hide critical initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Type confusion] Can the Result<Option<Runtime>, anyhow::Error> return type be misinterpreted by calling code, leading to incorrect error handling where Ok(None) is treated as success but indexer failed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Lifetime safety] Are the lifetime relationships between NodeConfig reference and the returned Runtime properly enforced, or can the runtime outlive the config it depends on? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Config race condition] If NodeConfig is modified concurrently while bootstrap_indexer is reading it, can this cause TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities where indexer configuration changes mid-initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Config injection via reference] Since NodeConfig is passed by reference, can modifications to the original config after bootstrap_indexer returns affect the running indexer, causing inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Default config exploitation] If NodeConfig contains uninitialized or default values for critical indexer settings, can this lead to insecure indexer configuration such as open database connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Runtime thread pool exhaustion] Can the Runtime returned by this function have its thread pool exhausted by malicious indexer tasks, preventing legitimate blockchain operations from executing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Async context corruption] If bootstrap_indexer is called from an async context, can this create nested runtime issues or executor conflicts that cause deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Channel overflow] Does the MempoolClientSender have bounded channels, or can an attacker overflow unbounded channels with malicious transactions, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Chain ID mismatch] If the ChainId parameter doesn't match the chain ID stored in the DbReader, can this cause the indexer to process blocks from the wrong chain, corrupting indexed data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Database state inconsistency] Can the indexer runtime start processing transactions before the DbReader is fully synchronized, leading to incomplete or corrupted indexed data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Initialization ordering] If bootstrap_indexer is called before other critical node components are initialized, can this cause the indexer to access uninitialized state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Feature flag runtime check] In the non-indexer build, does the function check if NodeConfig erroneously has indexer settings enabled, or does it silently ignore them creating confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Cross-compilation issues] Can cross-compiling with different feature flags for different platforms cause binary incompatibilities or security vulnerabilities in deployed nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Conditional compilation confusion] If development builds have indexer enabled but production builds don't, can this hide indexer-related bugs that only manifest in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Memory leak on error] If bootstrap_indexer_stream allocates resources before returning an error, can these resources leak when the error is propagated through the Option/Result conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Use after free via Arc] If the DbReader Arc is freed while the indexer runtime is still using it, can this cause use-after-free vulnerabilities despite Arc's reference counting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Double free protection] If the Runtime returned is improperly managed and dropped multiple times by calling code, does Rust's ownership system prevent double-free, or can manual memory management bypass it? (Medium)",
