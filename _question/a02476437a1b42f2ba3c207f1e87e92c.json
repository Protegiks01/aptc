  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Memory safety] [Clone semantics] Does cloning ConsensusNetworkClient create deep copies or shallow references that could lead to use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Memory safety] [Buffer overflow] Can large ConsensusMsg variants cause buffer overflows during serialization or network transmission? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Resource management] [Connection leaks] Can failed send_rpc() calls leave open network connections, eventually exhausting connection limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Resource management] [Message queue] Can unbounded message queuing in send_to_many() cause memory exhaustion under network pressure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Type safety] [Enum exhaustiveness] Are all match statements on ConsensusMsg exhaustive, or can new variants be added without updating all handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Type safety] [Trait bounds] Does the NetworkClientInterface trait properly constrain message types to prevent type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Type safety] [Generic constraints] Can the generic NetworkClient parameter be instantiated with types that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Rust safety] [Unsafe blocks] Are there any unsafe blocks in the implementation that could lead to undefined behavior? (Critical)",
