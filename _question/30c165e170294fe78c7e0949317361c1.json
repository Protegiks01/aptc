  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious BCS-encoded error map file with deeply nested structures or recursive references that causes stack overflow during deserialization at line 67, leading to validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a BCS-encoded file containing billions of error map entries that causes memory exhaustion during bcs::from_bytes() at line 67, allowing DoS of validator nodes during error map loading? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Panic-based DoS] Does the unwrap() at line 66 allow an attacker to panic validator nodes by providing an inaccessible or corrupted file path, causing node crashes and potentially halting consensus if enough validators are affected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Panic-based DoS] Does the unwrap() at line 67 for bcs::from_bytes() allow an attacker to panic validator nodes by providing malformed BCS data, causing deterministic crashes across all validators that load the corrupted error map?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft BCS data that deserializes to an ErrorMapping struct with type-confused fields, causing undefined behavior when error codes are later accessed, potentially leading to incorrect error reporting that masks critical security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Integer Overflow in BCS] Does the BCS deserialization at line 67 properly validate that BTreeMap sizes fit in memory, or can an attacker provide a file claiming to have u64::MAX entries, causing integer overflow in size calculations and heap corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Path Traversal] If the file path passed to from_file() comes from untrusted input, can an attacker use path traversal (../../../etc/passwd) to read arbitrary files from the validator filesystem and leak sensitive configuration data?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [Partial Write Corruption] If write_all() at line 73 fails mid-write but the unwrap() panics before cleanup, can this leave a partially-written corrupted error map file that causes all future from_file() calls to fail, permanently breaking error reporting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [Atomic Write Violation] Does to_file() perform atomic file writes (write-then-rename pattern), or can a crash mid-write leave a corrupted error map that breaks all subsequent error lookups, potentially masking critical consensus failures? (High)",
