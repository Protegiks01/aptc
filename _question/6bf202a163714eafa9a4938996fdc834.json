(Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: build_filter()] [Filter Bypass] Can malicious validator operators manipulate RUST_LOG environment variable (line 399-405) to disable critical security logging, hiding consensus violations or Byzantine behavior from monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: TruncatedLogString::new()] [Integer Overflow] Does the saturating_add at line 68 properly prevent overflow when RUST_LOG_FIELD_MAX_LEN is near usize::MAX, or could an attacker cause wrap-around leading to incorrect truncation that exposes sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: TruncatedLogString::new()] [UTF-8 Boundary] Can truncating at line 69 split a multi-byte UTF-8 character boundary, causing push_str at line 70 to create invalid UTF-8 that panics or corrupts log output when validators synchronize state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: TruncatedLogString::new()] [Information Disclosure] Could an attacker craft log messages where critical security information appears just after the truncation point, allowing them to hide evidence of Byzantine behavior or consensus attacks from monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: TruncatedLogString length check] [Logic Error] If RUST_LOG_FIELD_MAX_LEN is set to usize::MAX-10, does the length comparison at line 68 still work correctly, or could saturating_add cause truncation to be skipped for maliciously large log entries?
