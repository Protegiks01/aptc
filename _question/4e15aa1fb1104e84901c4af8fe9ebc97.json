  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/telemetry_log_sender.rs] [Function: add_to_batch()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow by sending logs that cause current_bytes += log.len() to wrap around usize::MAX, bypassing the max_bytes check and allowing unlimited batch accumulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/telemetry_log_sender.rs] [Function: add_to_batch()] [Off-by-One Error] Is the boundary condition at line 49 using '>' instead of '>=' intentional, allowing batches to grow to max_bytes + (largest_log_size - 1) bytes, potentially causing memory exhaustion?
