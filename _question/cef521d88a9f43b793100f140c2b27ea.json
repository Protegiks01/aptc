  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] [Information Disclosure] Are the private modules (constants, core_metrics, metrics, network_metrics, sender, telemetry_log_sender) correctly scoped, or could making them public expose sensitive telemetry implementation details that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] [Access Control] Should the 'sender' module remain private, or could public exposure allow external code to bypass authentication mechanisms when sending telemetry data to remote services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] [Metrics Manipulation] Could making 'metrics' or 'core_metrics' public allow malicious code to manipulate telemetry counters, potentially hiding validator misbehavior or performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Organization] [Dependency Chain] Does the module import order create any circular dependencies or initialization race conditions that could cause telemetry service failures during node startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Public API Surface] [API Design] Are the four public modules (cli_metrics, service, system_information, utils) the minimal necessary API surface, or do they expose functionality that could be abused for telemetry injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] [Principle of Least Privilege] Should 'telemetry_log_sender' remain private to prevent external manipulation of log transmission to telemetry services, which could be used to suppress evidence of attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Module Organization] [Code Review Gap] Does the lack of implementation in this coordination file make it easy to overlook security issues in the actual implementation modules during security audits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/lib.rs] [Public API] [Attack Surface] Could the public 'service' module expose telemetry service initialization functions that, if called multiple times or with malicious configurations, could cause resource exhaustion? (Low)"
