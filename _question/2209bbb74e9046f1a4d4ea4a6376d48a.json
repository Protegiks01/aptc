  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: minimize()] [Invalid Comparison] Can minimize() compare incompatible resource types if 'other' address contains different data structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - Loop (Arithmetic)] [Gas Exhaustion] Can loop_count near u64::MAX cause arithmetic loop to exceed transaction gas limits, hanging validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - Loop (BcsToBytes)] [Serialization DoS] Can BcsToBytes loop with large len parameter cause repeated BCS serialization to consume excessive gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - Fibonacci (Recursive)] [Exponential Complexity] Can large n values cause exponential recursion depth in fibonacci_recursive, exhausting stack or gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - MoveVmMicroBenchmark (Locals)] [Stack Exhaustion] Can the Locals benchmark create excessive local variables that overflow Move VM stack? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - GetFromConst] [Empty Array] If const_idx is 0 but array is empty, can this cause Move VM array access violation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - Half] [Division by Zero] Can repeated Half operations cause resource size to reach zero, then trigger division by zero in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/move_workloads.rs] [Function: create_payload() - Double] [Size Explosion] Can repeated Double operations cause resource size to exceed storage limits, filling validator disk space? (High)"
