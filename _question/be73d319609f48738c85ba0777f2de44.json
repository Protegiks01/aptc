  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: to_base64()] [Input validation] Does the to_base64() serialization function validate the maximum size of byte arrays before encoding, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by passing extremely large byte arrays through cryptographic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_base64()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker provide maliciously crafted base64 strings that, when decoded by from_base64(), result in unexpectedly large memory allocations that could DoS validator nodes during key deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_base64()] [Error handling] Does from_base64() properly sanitize error messages from base64::decode() to prevent information leakage about internal key storage structure when deserialization fails? (Low)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: to_base64()/from_base64()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the generic serde serialization to pass incompatible types through to_base64/from_base64, causing type confusion when deserializing cryptographic keys? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: from_base64()] [Timing attack] Does the base64 decoding in from_base64() perform constant-time comparison when validating cryptographic material, or can timing differences leak information about private keys stored in secure storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Function: to_base64()] [Canonicalization] Does to_base64() enforce canonical base64 encoding to prevent an attacker from creating multiple representations of the same cryptographic key that could bypass signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: storage] [Storage backend confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the Storage enum dispatch to cause a validator to use InMemoryStorage instead of VaultStorage, resulting in unprotected consensus private keys stored in process memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Trait: CryptoStorage] [Interface enforcement] Does the CryptoStorage trait enforce atomic operations for key rotation, or can concurrent calls to rotate_key() from different threads create inconsistent key versions that break consensus signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Trait: KVStorage] [Permission bypass] Can an attacker exploit the KVStorage abstraction to bypass Policy enforcement by directly calling underlying storage methods instead of going through access-controlled wrappers? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: policy] [Identity verification] Does the Policy system properly validate Identity::User claims before granting Capability permissions, or can an attacker impersonate another service to gain unauthorized access to validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: CryptoStorage] [Method signature confusion] Can the CryptoStorage trait's sign_using_version() method be called with a public key version that doesn't match the named private key, causing signature generation with wrong keys that could result in equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: namespaced] [Namespace injection] Can an attacker craft key names containing the NAMESPACE_SEPARATOR to break out of namespace isolation and access keys from other validators or services? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault] [Token renewal race] Does VaultStorage's automatic token renewal mechanism handle concurrent access safely, or can race conditions cause authentication token expiration during critical consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: Error] [Error enumeration] Do the exported Error types leak sensitive information about key storage structure (e.g., KeyNotSet, KeyVersionNotFound) that could help an attacker enumerate valid key names? (Low)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: crypto_kv_storage] [Key generation entropy] Does new_ed25519_key_pair() in CryptoKVStorage use sufficient entropy from OsRng, or can predictable key generation be exploited if the OS entropy pool is depleted during validator initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: on_disk] [File system race] Does OnDiskStorage protect against TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) attacks where an attacker replaces the key file between read() and write() operations? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: GetResponse] [Timestamp manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the last_update timestamp in GetResponse to cause stale cryptographic keys to be used after rotation, potentially allowing signature forgery with compromised old keys? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: in_memory] [Memory leakage] Does InMemoryStorage securely zero memory when keys are deleted or the storage is cleared, or do private keys remain in process memory where they could be extracted via memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Line 5: forbid(unsafe_code)] [Unsafe dependencies] While lib.rs forbids unsafe code, do the underlying storage implementations (Vault, OnDisk) contain any unsafe blocks in their dependencies that could bypass memory safety guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: crypto_storage] [Key export restrictions] Does the export_private_key() method enforce proper authorization checks, or can any service with read access export validator consensus private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Modules: crypto_kv_storage + namespaced] [Namespace key collision] Can combining Namespaced storage with CryptoKVStorage's get_previous_version_name() function create key collisions where namespace/key_previous accidentally overwrites another service's key? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Modules: storage + vault] [Backend switching attack] Can an attacker force a running validator to switch from VaultStorage to OnDiskStorage through the Storage enum, causing consensus keys to be written to unencrypted disk files? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: PublicKeyResponse] [Version confusion] Does PublicKeyResponse adequately distinguish between key versions to prevent confusion attacks where an old public key is used to verify signatures made with the current private key? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Modules: kv_storage + policy] [Testing feature abuse] Can the reset_and_clear() method guarded by #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'testing'))] be accidentally enabled in production builds, allowing an attacker to wipe all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault] [CAS race condition] Does VaultStorage's use_cas (compare-and-swap) flag properly prevent concurrent modifications to the same key, or can race conditions during validator key rotation cause inconsistent state? (High)"
