  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Struct: NamedAddress] [Address substitution] Can a malicious Move.toml file use specially crafted named addresses that pass validation but get incorrectly resolved to system addresses (0x1, 0x2) during compilation, allowing unauthorized access to framework modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Struct: NamedAddress] [Collision attacks] Can two different valid named addresses hash to the same value in the resolution graph's address mapping, causing incorrect address substitution during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Struct: NamedAddress] [Reserved name bypass] Does the validation check against Move reserved keywords (address, signer, vector), or can an attacker create a named address 'address' that causes parser confusion?
