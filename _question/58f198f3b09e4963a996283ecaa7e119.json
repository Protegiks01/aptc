  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Delegation: restore_utils::confirm_or_save_frozen_subtrees] By delegating to transaction_accumulator_db_raw(), does this bypass any safety checks in the normal accumulator API? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Delegation: restore_utils::save_transactions] Are the parameters validated before delegation, or can invalid combinations of txns/txn_infos/events/write_sets reach restore_utils causing corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Delegation: kv_replay flag] When kv_replay is true vs false, does this create different code paths in restore_utils that could have different security properties or validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Error Handling: All Functions] Do all functions properly propagate errors from underlying storage operations, or can failures be silently ignored leading to partial restore? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Error Handling: save_transactions] If save_transactions fails after partial writes, is there a rollback mechanism or does the database remain in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Error Handling: get_state_restore_receiver] If StateSnapshotRestore::new fails, are any resources properly cleaned up or could leaked resources accumulate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Recovery: Partial Restore] If a restore operation is interrupted (crash, network failure), can the database be recovered to a consistent state or is manual intervention required? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/backup/restore_handler.rs] [Recovery: Idempotency] Are restore operations idempotent, or would retrying a failed restore cause double-writes and corruption? (High)"
