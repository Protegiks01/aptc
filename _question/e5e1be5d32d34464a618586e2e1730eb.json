  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::is_replay()] [Replay attack] Can an attacker exploit the timestamp comparison logic (line 62) to bypass replay protection by sending timestamps at exact millisecond boundaries when multiple handshakes occur concurrently? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::store_timestamp()] [Race condition] Is there a race condition between is_replay() check (line 60-65) and store_timestamp() call (line 454) in upgrade_inbound() that allows two concurrent handshakes with identical timestamps to both succeed, enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::now()] [Integer overflow] Can timestamp conversion from u128 to u64 (line 52) cause overflow issues for timestamps far in the future, potentially wrapping around and allowing old replayed messages to appear valid? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::is_replay()] [Memory exhaustion] Does the HashMap storage (line 42) have unbounded growth potential in MaybeMutual mode if attackers repeatedly connect with new public keys, causing memory exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Struct: AntiReplayTimestamps] [Replay window] Does the strictly-increasing timestamp requirement (line 62) create issues during clock skew or NTP adjustments, potentially causing legitimate validators to be rejected and affecting network liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::store_timestamp()] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent writes to the same public key entry in the HashMap cause lost updates or corrupted timestamp values that break replay protection guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::now()] [Time manipulation] If an attacker controls the system clock on a validator node and sets it far into the future, can they generate timestamps that permanently lock out legitimate peers whose clocks are correct? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: AntiReplayTimestamps::is_replay()] [Timestamp precision] Does the millisecond granularity (line 52) provide sufficient protection against replay attacks, or can attackers exploit sub-millisecond timing to replay messages within the same millisecond window? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Enum: HandshakeAuthMode::Mutual] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker downgrade from Mutual to MaybeMutual authentication mode by manipulating network configuration, allowing unauthenticated connections to validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: HandshakeAuthMode::anti_replay_timestamps()] [Inconsistent protection] Does the anti-replay protection being disabled in MaybeMutual mode (line 130) create attack vectors where public network connections can be replayed indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: HandshakeAuthMode::mutual()] [Shared state] Can concurrent access to the RwLock<AntiReplayTimestamps> (line 105) cause deadlocks or lock contention that degrades handshake performance and affects validator liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Enum: HandshakeAuthMode::MaybeMutual] [Privilege escalation] Can an attacker connecting through MaybeMutual mode exploit incomplete validation to gain trusted peer privileges without proper authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: HandshakeAuthMode::server_only()] [Missing authentication] Does server_only mode (line 114) inadvertently allow any peer to connect to critical network segments by bypassing mutual authentication requirements? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Constant: CLIENT_MESSAGE_SIZE] [Buffer overflow] Can an attacker send messages larger than CLIENT_MESSAGE_SIZE (line 157-158) to trigger buffer overflows in the read_exact() call at line 327? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Constant: SERVER_MESSAGE_SIZE] [Message truncation] If the server response is shorter than SERVER_MESSAGE_SIZE (line 162), does read_exact() (line 244) hang indefinitely or cause validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Constant: PROLOGUE_SIZE] [Protocol confusion] Can mismatched PROLOGUE_SIZE expectations between client and server cause parsing errors that lead to authentication bypass or connection confusion? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Constant: TIMESTAMP_SIZE] [Type confusion] Does hardcoding TIMESTAMP_SIZE to 8 bytes (line 48) create vulnerabilities if future protocol changes require larger timestamps, causing backwards compatibility issues? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [Peer verification] After successful handshake, does the client verify that the server's actual public key matches remote_public_key parameter, or can a man-in-the-middle attack substitute a different server? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [Buffer initialization] Are the client_message buffers (line 196) properly zeroed before use, or could residual memory contents leak sensitive information in the prologue? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [Timestamp injection] Can the time_provider function parameter (line 189) be exploited to inject arbitrary timestamps that bypass anti-replay protection on the server side? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [RNG security] Does the OsRng initialization (line 209) properly seed the random number generator, or can weak randomness lead to predictable ephemeral keys in the Noise handshake? (Critical)",
