  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: CollectionUriMutateEvent] [Size Guarantees] Is there a maximum size guarantee for CollectionUriMutateEvent instances, or can events theoretically grow to gigabytes causing allocation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Filtering Bypass] Can attackers craft CollectionUriMutateEvents that bypass event filtering or access control systems, allowing unauthorized monitoring of private collection mutations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Storage Backend Vulnerability] If events are stored in different backend systems (RocksDB, PostgreSQL), can CollectionUriMutateEvent fields exploit backend-specific vulnerabilities like database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Event Aggregation Attack] Can attackers emit carefully crafted sequences of CollectionUriMutateEvents that, when aggregated by analytics systems, produce incorrect statistics or insights about collection activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_uri_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Backwards Compatibility] If the event format changes in future versions, could old CollectionUriMutateEvents become unprocessable, causing loss of historical data or breaking event replay functionality? (Medium)"
