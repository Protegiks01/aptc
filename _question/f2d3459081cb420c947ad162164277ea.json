  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Function: ClosureMask::format_arguments()] [Panic in Display] The function is used in Display implementation and deliberately doesn't panic on errors - can an attacker craft inputs that cause the unwrap_or_else fallback to hide critical validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Function: ClosureMask::format_arguments_impl()] [Insufficient captured args] If captured.len() is less than the number of set bits in mask, format_arguments_impl() returns None - can this be exploited to cause silent failures that hide closure construction errors? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Function: MoveClosure::serialize()] [Length calculation error] The sequence length is calculated as 5 + captured.len() * 2 - can this calculation overflow for large captured vectors, causing truncated serialization? (Medium)",
