  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: Module Loading] If code_invariant_error() is triggered during Move module loading or linking, can this cause modules to be partially loaded, leading to type confusion or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Determinism] [Non-Deterministic Debug] Since code_invariant_error() uses Debug formatting which may include pointers or non-deterministic data, can this cause different error messages across validators, leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Determinism] [Timing Dependency] Can the timing of when code_invariant_error() is called in parallel execution differ across validators, causing some to accept blocks while others reject them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Determinism] [println! Side Effects] Does the println! in code_invariant_error() cause any non-deterministic side effects (e.g., I/O timing) that could theoretically affect execution timing and create consensus divergence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Consensus] [Byzantine Validators] Can a Byzantine validator deliberately trigger code_invariant_error() selectively to cause their execution to differ from honest validators, enabling them to propose invalid blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Consensus] [Error Recovery] If one validator triggers code_invariant_error() for a block but others don't, will this create a permanent fork or can the network recover through reconfiguration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Gas] [Metering Bypass] When code_invariant_error() is triggered, is gas properly charged for the work done before the error, or can attackers get free computation by deliberately triggering invariant violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Gas] [Error Message Cost] Is the cost of formatting large error messages in code_invariant_error() accounted for in gas metering, or can attackers cause expensive string operations without paying gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Gas] [println! Cost] Does the println! output consume validator resources without being reflected in transaction gas costs, enabling a griefing attack against validator infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [DoS] [Error Flooding] Can an attacker submit many transactions that trigger code_invariant_error(), filling validator logs and forcing sequential execution fallback, causing sustained performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Memory Safety] [String Allocation] Can unbounded string growth in the format! macro at line 12-15 cause memory exhaustion if an attacker controls the Debug output of message M? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Memory Safety] [Drop Safety] If code_invariant_error() is called while holding locks or resources, are they properly dropped/released on the error path, or can this cause deadlocks or resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Type Safety] [Generic Constraints] Are the Debug bounds on M and E sufficient, or should there be additional trait bounds (Send, Sync, 'static) to prevent use-after-free or thread safety issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Type Safety] [Error Conversion] Does the conversion from generic error E to PartialVMError lose type information that could be exploited, such as distinguishing between authentication errors and invariant violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Delayed Fields] [Aggregator Overflow] When delayed field aggregator operations (try_add/try_sub) overflow, should they return speculative errors or trigger code_invariant_error? Can confusion here cause fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Delayed Fields] [Snapshot Consistency] If code_invariant_error() occurs during delayed field snapshot operations, can this leave snapshots in an inconsistent state that breaks future transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Delayed Fields] [Value Replacement] When replacing delayed field values with identifiers and expect_ok() is used, can an attacker craft values that should fail replacement but are incorrectly treated as invariant violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Delayed Fields] [Multi-Version Conflict] In the multi-versioned delayed fields data structure, can code_invariant_error() be triggered by legitimate read-after-write conflicts, incorrectly treating them as bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Delayed Fields] [Materialization] During delayed field materialization at transaction output, if code_invariant_error() occurs, are all transactions in the block discarded or just the failing one? Can this enable censorship? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Error Chain] [Information Loss] As errors propagate from expect_ok() -> code_invariant_error() -> PartialVMError -> VMError -> TransactionStatus, is critical attack information preserved for security auditing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Error Chain] [Context Loss] When code_invariant_error() wraps an error, does it preserve the original error's location, making it difficult to debug genuine bugs versus exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Error Chain] [Panic Conversion] Is there any code path where code_invariant_error() could be used to convert panics into errors, potentially hiding critical security failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Error Chain] [Status Code Confusion] Can other parts of the codebase confuse DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR with SPECULATIVE_EXECUTION_ABORT_ERROR, leading to incorrect handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Testing] [Missing Tests] Are there comprehensive tests that verify code_invariant_error() and expect_ok() behave correctly under all error conditions, or can untested paths hide vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Testing] [Fuzzing] Has fuzzing been applied to the Debug implementations of various error types passed to code_invariant_error() to detect format string vulnerabilities? (Low)"
