  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [DoS via panic] Can an attacker supply a malicious or malformed processor name through the IndexerConfig that triggers the panic! at line 28, causing the entire indexer runtime to crash and resulting in total loss of indexing service availability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Service disruption] Does the panic! in from_string() at line 28 propagate through the runtime.rs spawn context at line 132, potentially crashing the entire indexer thread and preventing transaction indexing recovery without manual restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Configuration injection] Can a malicious operator or compromised configuration file inject arbitrary processor names that bypass validation, triggering the panic and causing repeated indexer crashes in a loop? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Error handling bypass] Why does from_string() use panic! instead of Result<Self, Error> for error handling, preventing callers from gracefully handling invalid processor names and implementing fallback mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Runtime stability] If the processor_name variable in runtime.rs line 132 is populated from untrusted external input or corrupted config files, can this trigger the panic and cause cascading failures across the indexer infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Case sensitivity bypass] Does the string comparison at lines 23-27 use case-sensitive matching, allowing an attacker to bypass validation by supplying processor names with different casing (e.g., 'DefaultProcessor' vs 'defaultprocessor')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Whitespace injection] Can an attacker inject leading/trailing whitespace or Unicode whitespace characters in the processor name to bypass the string matching logic at lines 23-27, causing unexpected behavior or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Unicode normalization] Are Unicode normalization attacks possible where visually identical but byte-different processor names bypass validation, potentially causing security issues in processor selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [String injection] Can special characters, control characters, or escape sequences in the processor name string cause injection vulnerabilities or bypass the match statement at lines 23-27? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Length validation] Is there any maximum length validation for the input_str parameter, or can extremely long processor names cause memory exhaustion or buffer-related issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Unauthorized processor selection] Does from_string() perform any authorization checks to verify that the caller is allowed to instantiate specific processor types, or can any code path select arbitrary processors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Privilege escalation] Can an attacker manipulate the processor selection to use a more privileged processor type (e.g., DefaultProcessor vs TokenProcessor) to gain unauthorized access to different database tables or transaction data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Configuration tampering] If the IndexerConfig at runtime.rs line 108 is sourced from an untrusted location or can be modified by unauthorized users, can this lead to malicious processor selection via from_string()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Processor isolation] Does each processor variant have proper isolation guarantees, or can selecting a specific processor via from_string() grant access to data or operations that should be restricted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Variant exhaustiveness] If new processor types are added to the Processor enum at lines 14-19 but the from_string() match statement at lines 23-27 is not updated, will the default panic branch at line 28 hide missing implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Type confusion] Can the processor enum variants be confused or misused in ways that cause incorrect processor instantiation at runtime.rs lines 133-144, leading to wrong transaction processing logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Pattern matching completeness] Does the match statement at lines 23-27 cover all possible processor types defined in the enum at lines 14-19, or are there missing variants that could cause runtime panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Discriminant manipulation] Could unsafe code or memory corruption cause the Processor enum discriminant to be manipulated, leading to type confusion and undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Thread safety] Is from_string() called concurrently from multiple threads in the indexer runtime, and could race conditions in string comparison or processor instantiation cause data corruption or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Concurrent processor access] If multiple instances of processors are created via from_string() calls in runtime.rs line 132 from concurrent tasks, can this lead to shared state corruption or database connection pool exhaustion? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Atomic selection] Is processor selection via from_string() atomic with respect to configuration changes, or can configuration updates mid-execution cause inconsistent processor behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Cross-processor state] If different processor types selected via from_string() access the same database tables or shared state, can this cause data corruption or inconsistent indexing results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Transaction ordering] Can selecting different processors via from_string() in parallel execution contexts cause transaction processing order to become non-deterministic, breaking indexing consistency? (High)",
