  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: ark_binary_op_internal] [Cast Overflow] When casting u64 handles to usize (handle_1, handle_2), can this overflow on 32-bit systems or cause undefined behavior on systems where usize < u64? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: ark_binary_op_internal] [Double Borrow] Does safe_borrow_element! properly handle the case where handle_1 == handle_2, or can this cause double borrows of the same Rc pointer leading to UB? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: ark_binary_op_internal] [Gas Timing] Gas is charged AFTER borrowing elements but BEFORE multiplication - can attackers cause OOM or panics after gas is charged but before operation completes, keeping gas without providing work? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: ark_binary_op_internal] [Element Lifetime] After calling element_1.mul(element_2), are element_1_ptr and element_2_ptr properly dropped before store_element!, or can this cause reference counting issues?

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: safe_borrow_element] [Out-of-Bounds Access] Can attackers provide handle values >= objs.len() causing get($handle) to return None, and does ok_or_else properly abort without causing panics or undefined behavior?

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: store_element] [Memory Limit Bypass] Does MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES (1MB) check properly account for Rc overhead and Vec capacity growth, or can attackers exceed 1MB through allocation overhead? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: store_element] [Size Calculation] Does std::mem::size_of_val(&$obj) correctly measure all memory including nested allocations in arkworks types, or does it undercount allowing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Macro: store_element] [Integer Overflow] Can context.bytes_used + size_of_val overflow before comparison with MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES, bypassing the memory limit check? (High)",
