  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Documentation] [Calling Convention Enforcement] The documentation states CallFunction requires matching type signatures - if this isn't enforced, can it be exploited for type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Documentation] [Paranoid Mode Bypass] Documentation mentions 'paranoid mode' validation - can attackers exploit differences between paranoid and normal modes? (Medium)",
