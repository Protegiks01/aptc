  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Clone safety] The Clone derive could allow multiple references to the same key data - can this cause use-after-free or double-free if the underlying HexEncodedBytes is modified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [PartialEq bypass] Can the PartialEq implementation be exploited if two semantically different keys compare as equal due to hex encoding normalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [JSON injection] Can special characters in the hex string (quotes, backslashes, null bytes) cause JSON injection when the request is logged or reflected in responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Poem OpenAPI] Does the Object derive from poem_openapi properly validate the schema, or can malformed OpenAPI requests bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [State version] Does the request include ledger version synchronization to ensure consistent reads, or can race conditions return stale/inconsistent state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Concurrent access] If multiple requests with the same key are processed concurrently, can race conditions in the state view cause inconsistent responses or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between deserializing the key and fetching the state value, can the state change due to committed transactions, causing time-of-check-to-time-of-use bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Atomic read] Is the state value read atomic, or can partial writes from concurrent transactions be observed, violating state consistency guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Cache poisoning] If state values are cached, can an attacker poison the cache by submitting malicious keys that map to incorrect state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Memory amplification] Can the hex-encoded key be crafted such that its in-memory representation (after decoding to bytes) is orders of magnitude larger than the input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Computational DoS] Does BCS deserialization of complex nested StateKey structures consume excessive CPU, allowing attackers to slow down API servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Storage amplification] Can repeated requests with slightly different keys force the system to load and cache many large state values, exhausting server memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Disk I/O DoS] Can an attacker craft keys targeting cold storage or pruned data, forcing expensive disk seeks and degrading API performance for legitimate users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Database query bomb] Can the StateKey deserialization trigger expensive database queries (e.g., Merkle tree traversal) without proper query cost limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Hash collision] If StateKey hashing is used for indexing, can an attacker craft colliding keys to access unintended state values or cause cache collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Merkle proof bypass] Can a malicious key skip Merkle proof verification when fetching state values, returning unverified data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Cryptographic downgrade] If the hex-encoded key includes cryptographic parameters, can an attacker force weaker algorithms or bypass signature checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Move type bypass] Can the raw key access give an attacker the ability to read Move resources without going through the type system, violating resource safety? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Panic on invalid input] Does invalid hex decoding cause unwrap() panics rather than graceful error returns, crashing the API server thread? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Empty key handling] How does the system handle an empty key field (0x), and can this cause null pointer dereferences or index out of bounds? (Medium)",
