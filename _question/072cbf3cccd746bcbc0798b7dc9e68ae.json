  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Capacity Limits] Is there an upper bound check on capacity to prevent integer overflow in Semaphore or excessive memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Handle Validation] Does new() validate that the provided tokio Handle is valid and connected to a running runtime, or can invalid handles cause panics later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Runtime Compatibility] Can BoundedExecutor work correctly with different tokio runtime configurations (single-threaded, multi-threaded), or are there compatibility issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Capacity Zero] If capacity=0, does the executor deadlock permanently, or is there graceful handling of this edge case? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Capacity One] With capacity=1, can race conditions in concurrent spawn attempts cause unexpected behavior or permit leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Maximum Capacity] Can setting capacity to usize::MAX cause overflow in semaphore operations or excessive memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Empty Futures] Can spawning zero-duration futures that complete immediately cause permit thrashing and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Never-Completing Futures] If spawned futures never complete, can they permanently consume permits, gradually reducing available capacity to zero? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Immediate Cancellation] If a spawned task is cancelled immediately after being spawned, are there race conditions in permit release? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Generic Bounds] Are the 'static bounds on futures too restrictive, preventing legitimate use cases with borrowed data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Output Type Bounds] Do the Send + 'static bounds on F::Output prevent returning references or non-Send types that might be needed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Closure Bounds] In spawn_blocking(), are the FnOnce bounds appropriate, or can FnMut closures cause issues if mistakenly used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Return Types] Should spawn() and try_spawn() return Result types to force error handling, or is returning JoinHandle sufficient? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Test Coverage] Do the existing tests in executor.rs adequately cover permit leak scenarios, or are there untested edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Stress Testing] Have the tests validated behavior under extreme load (thousands of concurrent tasks), which might reveal race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Panic Testing] Do tests verify that panicking tasks properly release permits without corrupting executor state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Cancellation Testing] Are there tests for task cancellation scenarios to ensure permits are not leaked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Semaphore Implementation] Does the underlying tokio Semaphore use appropriate memory ordering for permit operations, or can weak ordering cause race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Arc Reference Counting] Can concurrent Arc::clone() and Arc::drop() operations cause reference count races that lead to use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Permit Count Accuracy] Is the semaphore permit count accurately maintained under high concurrency, or can atomic operation races cause count drift? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Graceful Shutdown] When a validator node shuts down, are all BoundedExecutor instances properly cleaned up, or can pending tasks prevent graceful shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Runtime Shutdown] If the tokio runtime is shut down while tasks are pending, does this cause panics or resource leaks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Permit Release on Shutdown] During shutdown, are all acquired permits properly released back to the semaphore? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Task Abortion] Can forcefully aborting tasks during shutdown leave the executor in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
