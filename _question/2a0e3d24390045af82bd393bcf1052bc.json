  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Cryptography] [Hash collision] Can attackers craft collection_name strings that produce hash collisions with legitimate collections, causing event misattribution in hash-indexed databases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Concurrency] [Data race] In parallel execution environments, can concurrent reads of CollectionMaximumMutateEvent fields through getter methods race with event emission, returning partially constructed event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock-free exploit] Since there are no synchronization primitives, can lock-free event access patterns in multi-threaded indexers read torn values where old_maximum and new_maximum come from different events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Arithmetic] [Overflow in delta] Can computing the mutation delta (new_maximum - old_maximum) overflow when old_maximum > new_maximum, causing incorrect supply change calculations in analytics systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Arithmetic] [Underflow attack] Can setting old_maximum to u64::MAX and new_maximum to 0 cause underflow in systems tracking cumulative maximum increases across all collection mutations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Stream poisoning] [Event flooding] Can high-frequency emission of maximum mutation events (e.g., toggling between two values every block) overwhelm event processing pipelines and cause indexer lag? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Governance] [Breaking changes] If governance upgrades the token_event_store module to fix the typo in struct name, will all historical CollectionMaximumMutateEvent instances become undeserializable, losing mutation history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Upgrade] [Type migration] When migrating to a corrected struct name, can events exist with both old and new type tags causing duplicate or inconsistent mutation records in indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum boundary] Can setting new_maximum to u64::MAX cause overflow in downstream logic that increments beyond the maximum (e.g., maximum + 1 for checks), resulting in wrap-around to 0? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Edge case] [Empty collection name] Can events with empty collection_name strings bypass indexer filters that assume non-empty names, allowing invisible collections to mutate without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Boundary] [Identical values] When old_maximum == new_maximum, should the event still be emitted, or does this create meaningless log entries that bloat storage without recording actual changes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Code maintenance] [Typo propagation] Can the typo in STRUCT_NAME propagate to other parts of the codebase, creating inconsistencies where some code references the correct spelling and others use the typo, causing event filtering failures?
