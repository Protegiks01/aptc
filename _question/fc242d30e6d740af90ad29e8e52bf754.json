  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Gas Parameter Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the gas_feature_version parameter by providing an extremely high version number that causes integer overflow or accesses uninitialized gas parameter arrays, leading to incorrect gas metering and potential DoS through zero-cost native calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Gas Bypass] Can malicious code pass NativeGasParameters::zeros() in production to disable all gas metering for native functions, allowing unlimited computation and storage operations that could halt the network or cause state explosion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Gas Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate MiscGasParameters::zeros() to bypass storage gas costs, memory expansion costs, or other miscellaneous charges, enabling them to perform resource-intensive operations without payment and causing validator resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Feature Flag Bypass] Can TimedFeaturesBuilder::enable_all() be exploited in production builds to activate test-only or experimental features that were never intended for mainnet, potentially enabling unsafe operations or bypassing security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Feature Flag Manipulation] Can the Features::default() configuration be manipulated at runtime to enable disabled features or disable security-critical features, allowing attackers to bypass consensus rules, gas metering, or Move VM safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Builder Configuration] Does SafeNativeBuilder::new() properly validate that gas_feature_version matches the expected network version, or can version mismatch lead to incorrect gas calculations, enabling attackers to exploit gas estimation differences between validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Builder Configuration] Can the None parameter passed to SafeNativeBuilder::new() for gas_hook be exploited by injecting a malicious hook in a fork or modified build that logs sensitive data, manipulates gas calculations, or causes side effects during native execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Native Table Injection] Does aptos_natives_with_builder() properly validate the inject_create_signer_for_gov_sim parameter is false in production, or can a race condition, configuration error, or binary patching enable test natives in production nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Return Value Integrity] Can the NativeFunctionTable returned by aptos_natives() be modified after construction but before use by the Move VM, allowing an attacker to inject malicious native functions or replace legitimate ones with backdoored implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives()] [Thread Safety] Is the NativeFunctionTable construction thread-safe, or can concurrent calls to aptos_natives() from multiple threads lead to race conditions where one thread's gas parameters affect another thread's native function table? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Can an attacker bypass the create_signers_for_testing detection by registering the function under a different module name but with the same functionality, allowing unauthorized signer creation in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Does the validation properly check for ed25519::generate_keys_internal in all possible name variations (capitalization, unicode equivalents, or namespace injection), or can attackers register this dangerous key generation function under a similar but undetected name? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Can ed25519::sign_internal be registered under a different address (not CORE_CODE_ADDRESS) to bypass detection, allowing attackers to create arbitrary signatures without private keys and forge transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Does the multi_ed25519::generate_keys_internal check cover all multi-signature schemes, or can attackers register test key generation for other signature schemes (secp256k1, schnorr) that aren't checked? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Can multi_ed25519::sign_internal bypass detection through function pointer manipulation, dynamic registration, or JIT compilation that registers the function after assert_no_test_natives() completes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Does the bls12381::generate_keys_internal check prevent all BLS key generation methods, or can attackers use alternative BLS implementations, curves, or parameter sets to generate keys in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Can bls12381::sign_internal be replaced with a wrapper function that internally calls the test native but presents a different external name, bypassing the string matching validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Does bls12381::generate_proof_of_possession_internal check prevent forged proofs of possession that could allow attackers to register validators with keys they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Test Native Leak] Can event::emitted_events_internal bypass detection to allow attackers to query or manipulate event logs, potentially exposing sensitive transaction data or allowing event replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Validation Logic] Does the all() iterator properly validate every native function, or can short-circuit evaluation or early termination cause some natives to skip validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [String Comparison] Are the string comparisons for module_name.as_str() and func_name.as_str() vulnerable to unicode normalization attacks where visually identical but byte-different strings bypass the checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Assertion Timing] Is assert_no_test_natives() called early enough in the node startup sequence, or can native functions be executed before validation completes, allowing brief windows where test natives are accessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Error Handling] Does the assertion provide sufficient diagnostic information in err_msg to debug why test natives are present, or could vague error messages delay incident response during a security breach? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Runtime Validation] Can assert_no_test_natives() be disabled via feature flags, environment variables, or runtime configuration that could be manipulated by attackers with node access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: assert_no_test_natives()] [Incomplete Coverage] Does the function check for all possible test natives, or are there additional test-only functions in other modules (randomness, cryptography, state) that aren't validated? (High)"
