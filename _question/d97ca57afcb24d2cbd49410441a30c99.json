  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide a backing_string() that returns extremely long strings causing the split('\\\\n').map().collect() operation to consume excessive memory, potentially causing OOM crashes in the development environment? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the bytecode_text Vec<String> have any size limits, or can maliciously crafted bytecode with millions of lines cause unbounded memory allocation during initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: new()] [Line ending handling] The split('\\\\n') operation only handles Unix line endings - can bytecode with Windows-style \\\\r\\\\n or mixed line endings cause incorrect line indexing that leads to out-of-bounds access in bound_column()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: new()] [String allocation] When converting each line to String via to_string(), can extremely long individual lines (e.g., 1GB single line) cause allocation failures or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty string handling] If backing_string() returns an empty string, will split('\\\\n') create a vector with one empty string element, potentially causing issues in bound_line() when it tries to subtract 1? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Type conversion overflow] The line_number parameter is u16 (max 65,535) but is cast to usize - can bytecode files with more than 65,535 lines cause line numbers to wrap around, accessing wrong lines or causing out-of-bounds access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Type conversion overflow] The column_number parameter is u16 but cast to usize - can extremely wide lines (>65,535 characters) cause column wrapping that accesses incorrect positions in the source code highlighting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Unchecked unwrap] Line 60 calls source_for_code_location().unwrap() without checking if the Result is Ok - can malformed source maps or invalid bytecode info cause this to panic and crash the viewer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Option handling] When get_source_index_for_line() returns None (line 54), the code falls back to displaying the entire source - but does this bypass security checks in source_for_code_location() that might prevent displaying unauthorized files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Memory allocation] The TextBuilder operations create new strings by concatenating source_context.left, highlight, and remainder - can an attacker craft bytecode that causes these strings to be gigabytes in size, exhausting memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Clone operations] Line 74 clones every string in bytecode_text - for large bytecode files, can repeated redraws cause excessive memory allocation and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Highlighting injection] The highlight text (line 64) is rendered with red background - can special terminal escape sequences in the source code break out of the highlighting and execute arbitrary terminal commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: on_redraw()] [Iterator safety] The iter().map().collect() chain on line 72-75 assumes bytecode_text hasn't been modified - can concurrent modifications to bytecode_text cause iterator invalidation or data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_line()] [Integer underflow] Line 83 calls checked_sub(1).unwrap() - if bytecode_text.len() is 0 (empty bytecode), this will panic and crash the viewer, potentially during automated testing or fuzzing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_line()] [Panic on empty input] If bytecode_text is empty, checked_sub(1) returns None and unwrap() panics - can malformed bytecode files with no content trigger this panic condition during initialization or viewing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_line()] [Type conversion] Converting bytecode_text.len() (usize) to u16 can overflow if there are more than 65,535 lines - will this cause bound_line to return incorrect maximum line numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_line()] [Overflow truncation] If bytecode_text.len() exceeds u16::MAX (65,535), the 'as u16' cast will truncate the value - can this cause bound_line to allow accessing line numbers that don't exist, leading to out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_line()] [std::cmp::min edge case] If line_number is u16::MAX and bytecode_text is shorter, the min() comparison works correctly, but does the subtraction handle the case where len() is exactly 1? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [Array indexing] Line 90 directly indexes bytecode_text[line_number as usize] without bounds checking - if line_number hasn't been properly bounded by bound_line(), can this cause an out-of-bounds panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [Race condition] If bytecode_text is modified between the bound_line() call and bound_column() call, the line_number might be valid in bound_line() but out of bounds in bound_column() - is this possible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [Type conversion overflow] Converting the string length (usize) to u16 can overflow for lines longer than 65,535 characters - will this cause bound_column to return truncated column bounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [Empty line handling] If the line at bytecode_text[line_number] is an empty string (length 0), does the min() comparison correctly bound column_number to 0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [UTF-8 character boundaries] The .len() method returns byte length, not character count - for lines with multi-byte UTF-8 characters, can column_number point to the middle of a character causing rendering issues or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Function: bound_column()] [Unchecked indexing] Since bound_column() is called after on_redraw() uses the column number, if bound_column() has a bug, can it cause source_for_code_location() to receive invalid column numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Struct: Viewer] [Clone trait] The Viewer struct derives Clone - can deep cloning of large bytecode_text vectors cause memory exhaustion or performance issues during viewer operations? (Low)"
