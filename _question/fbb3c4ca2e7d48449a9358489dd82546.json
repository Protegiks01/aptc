  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_dashboard_link()] [URL Parsing] Can invalid DASHBOARD_BASE_URL values cause unwrap() to panic in Url::parse(), crashing the validator node during startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push_metrics_extra_labels()] [String Injection] Are there length limits on chain_name and namespace parameters to prevent excessively long strings from causing memory issues or protocol violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: start()] [Duplicate Pushers] Can multiple MetricsPusher instances be created simultaneously, causing duplicate metric submissions and confusion in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: worker()] [Metric Staleness] If the worker thread fails silently, can stale metrics persist in the monitoring system, hiding ongoing attacks or performance issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push()] [Request Ordering] Are metrics pushed in a consistent order, or can reordering cause confusion in time-series analysis and anomaly detection systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push()] [Memory Leak] If ureq::post() allocates resources that aren't properly freed on error paths, can repeated failures cause memory leaks in long-running validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: worker()] [Stack Overflow] Can deep recursion in metric gathering or encoding cause stack overflow, especially if metrics contain circular references or deeply nested structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: worker()] [Zero Duration] If push_metrics_frequency_secs is parsed as 0 through integer underflow, can Duration::from_secs(0) cause immediate continuous pushing in a tight loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_dashboard_link()] [Time Precision] Does the 600-second lookback window capture relevant attack activity, or can attackers exploit timing gaps to hide malicious behavior between monitoring windows? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_worker_thread()] [Configuration Injection] Can environment variables be modified after process start to dynamically change metrics behavior, potentially allowing runtime attacks on monitoring infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push()] [Content-Type Header] Is the correct Content-Type header set for Prometheus metrics format, or can incorrect headers cause pushgateway to reject or misinterpret metrics data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push_metrics_extra_labels()] [Label Cardinality] Can an attacker cause cardinality explosion in the time-series database by generating unique run_uuid values for each push, exhausting storage and query performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: worker()] [Thread Name] Is the worker thread given an identifiable name for debugging, or can unnamed threads cause confusion during incident response and forensic analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push()] [Retry Logic] Does the code implement retry logic for failed pushes, or can transient network issues cause permanent metric loss and monitoring blind spots? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: join()] [Timeout] Does join() wait indefinitely for the worker thread, or can hung threads prevent validator node shutdown during emergency procedures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: push()] [Request Method] Is POST the appropriate HTTP method for pushing metrics, or should PUT or other methods be used to ensure idempotency and prevent duplicate data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: worker()] [Panic Handling] If panic occurs in the worker thread, does it crash the entire process or is it properly caught to prevent validator node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-push-metrics/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_dashboard_link()] [Time Zone] Are timestamps in UTC or local time, and can time zone confusion cause incorrect dashboard time ranges or monitoring gaps? (Low)",
