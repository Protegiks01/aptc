  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: crypto_kv_storage + OsRng] [RNG reseeding] Does new_ed25519_key_pair() properly reseed the RNG between key generations, or can entropy pool depletion cause correlated keys across multiple validators? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: Storage enum] [Default backend security] What is the default Storage backend if not explicitly configured, and does it meet security requirements for production validator deployments? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: namespaced] [Namespace isolation guarantees] Does the Namespaced wrapper provide strong cryptographic isolation between namespaces, or is it merely a string prefix that could be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Module: vault + renewal] [Token expiration handling] What happens if VaultStorage's automatic token renewal fails during critical consensus operations - does it cause key access failures and validator halts? (High)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Modules: in_memory + testing] [Test key leakage] Can deterministic test keys from import_private_key() accidentally be used in production if testing code paths are enabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: secure/storage/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: KVStorage::available()] [Availability check failures] Do all critical operations properly check available() before accessing storage, or can operations proceed with unavailable storage leading to undefined behavior? (High)"
