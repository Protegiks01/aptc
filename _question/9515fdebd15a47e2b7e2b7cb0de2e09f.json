  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/interface.rs] [Memory] [Arc cycle] Can the Arc<PeersAndMetadata> returned by get_peers_and_metadata() create reference cycles with network_client that prevent proper cleanup when the health checker is dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/interface.rs] [Memory] [Unbounded queue] If the receiver field is backed by an unbounded channel, can Byzantine peers flood it with health check events causing unbounded memory growth and validator OOM crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/interface.rs] [Testing] [Race condition testing] Are there comprehensive concurrency tests that verify health_check_data consistency under high contention with multiple threads calling increment/reset/create/remove operations simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/interface.rs] [Testing] [Fuzz testing] Has the round number comparison logic been fuzz-tested with random round values including u64::MAX, 0, and near-overflow values to ensure no arithmetic errors exist? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/interface.rs] [Testing] [Byzantine adversary simulation] Are there tests simulating coordinated Byzantine peer attacks on the health check system to verify the system maintains liveness and safety under adversarial conditions? (Critical)"
