  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Value validation] Are interned values validated before insertion? Can an attacker intern invalid or malformed values (e.g., invalid UTF-8 in strings) that later cause crashes during Move bytecode processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Flush validation] Is there any validation that flush() should only be called at safe points? Can it be called during active transaction execution, corrupting in-flight operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern()] [Duplicate validation] The double-check pattern ensures no duplicates, but are duplicates truly harmful? Can an attacker exploit the assumption of uniqueness in calling code if duplicates somehow slip through? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Buffer capacity validation] Is there a maximum limit on buffer capacity? Can next_size grow so large that Vec::with_capacity fails to allocate, causing OOM crashes on validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentBTreeInterner] [RwLock fairness] Does parking_lot's RwLock provide fairness guarantees? Can writer starvation prevent new values from being interned, or reader starvation prevent lookups, affecting Move transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Critical section size] The write lock is held during alloc, vec.push, and map.insert - can this large critical section cause unacceptable lock contention during parallel Move transaction execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: lookup()] [Read lock duration] Lookup acquires a read lock and clones the index - can this be optimized to reduce lock hold time, or is the current implementation optimal for Move VM's access patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: len()] [Unnecessary locking] Does len() need to acquire a read lock? Could an atomic counter provide better performance without sacrificing correctness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Memory ordering] Are the memory operations within the locked sections properly ordered with respect to happens-before relationships? Can reordering cause a thread to see an updated vec but stale map data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Visibility after flush] After flush() completes, are all threads guaranteed to see the cleared state immediately, or can cached reads cause threads to use old indices that are now invalid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Publication safety] When a newly interned value is made visible by inserting into map and vec, is the value's memory guaranteed to be visible to other threads, or can CPU cache effects cause them to see uninitialized data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentBTreeInterner] [Data race freedom] Are all accesses to shared state properly synchronized through the RwLock? Can any data races occur through the 'static references stored in external data structures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_by_ref()] [Ownership semantics] Does intern_by_ref correctly handle the case where the borrowed value becomes owned? Can the original reference be invalidated while being cloned, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Cow optimization] The Cow pattern defers cloning until necessary, but can this optimization be bypassed by adversarial access patterns, causing unnecessary clones and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern()] [Move semantics] Does intern() properly move the value into the interner without making unnecessary copies? Can any double-free or use-after-move issues occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Resource cleanup] Does flush() properly release all allocated resources, or can it leak file descriptors, network connections, or other resources if T contains such resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Test: test_many_unique_values] [Scale testing] The test only goes up to 1000 values - can issues occur at larger scales (millions of values) that would be encountered on mainnet, such as buffer allocation failures or index exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Test: test_interner_consistency] [Proptest coverage] Does the property test adequately cover concurrent access patterns? Can race conditions occur in production that aren't exercised by the sequential test harness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: get()] [Test-only annotation] Why is get() marked test-only? Does this indicate a known safety issue, and could removing the annotation expose vulnerabilities in production use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Test: test_intern_duplicate] [Equality testing] Does the test properly verify that indices are stable across duplicate interns, or could hash collisions or BTreeMap rebalancing cause different indices for equal values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Usage context] [Module name interning] If used for Move module names, can namespace confusion occur where 'A::B::C' and 'A::B' share prefixes, causing module resolution errors or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Usage context] [Type parameter interning] If used for generic type parameters, can malicious type instantiations cause index collisions that allow one generic function to access another's specialized code, breaking type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Usage context] [Function name interning] If used for function names, can attackers craft function names that collide with system functions, allowing unauthorized calls to privileged Move functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Usage context] [Struct field interning] If used for struct field names, can field name confusion cause transactions to read/write wrong fields, violating Move's resource safety guarantees? (High)",
