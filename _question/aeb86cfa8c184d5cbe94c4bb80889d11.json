  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [my_peer_id confusion] Does the shutdown sequence validate that the VerifiedEvent::Shutdown is sent with correct my_peer_id on line 98, or can identity confusion cause shutdown messages to target wrong validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/quorum_store_coordinator.rs] [Function: start()] [Component shutdown timeout] Are there timeouts on the oneshot channel await operations, or can a frozen/crashed component cause the entire shutdown sequence to hang indefinitely blocking validator restart?
