  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Concurrency] [Future polling order] Can the order in which futures are polled by tokio affect consensus ordering, causing validators to process blocks in different sequences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Concurrency] [Channel buffer overflow] If channel buffers overflow due to slow processing, are messages dropped or does backpressure propagate correctly to prevent data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Integrity] [Response tampering] Can responses be tampered with after process() returns but before tx.send() completes at line 103, allowing attackers to modify consensus decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Integrity] [Request authentication] Are CountedRequests authenticated before processing, or can an attacker inject unauthenticated requests into rx from external sources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/pipeline_phase.rs] [Integrity] [Channel encryption] Are channels between phases encrypted or authenticated, or can network-level attackers intercept and modify messages in transit? (High)"
