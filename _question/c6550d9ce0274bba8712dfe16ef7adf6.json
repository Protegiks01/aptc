  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: get_local_framework_path()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker manipulate CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR environment variable at compile time to cause the framework path resolution to point to a malicious directory containing backdoored Move framework code, leading to deployment of compromised contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: get_local_framework_path()] [Path traversal] Does the parent().and_then(|p| p.parent()) chain properly validate that the resulting path exists and is within expected boundaries, or can symlink attacks cause it to resolve to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: get_local_framework_path()] [Panic condition] If CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR is set to a path without sufficient parent directories (e.g., '/'), will the .expect('framework path') panic crash the build process, causing denial of service during package generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: get_local_framework_path()] [Path injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or path components into CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR to bypass the .join('aptos-move').join('framework') logic and load framework code from an unintended location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: get_local_framework_path()] [Race condition] Between the time get_local_framework_path() computes the path and when it's used by StdVersion::Local, can an attacker replace the framework directory with malicious code via filesystem race condition (TOCTOU)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackagesBundle::get_package()] [Panic condition] The unwrap_or_else with panic! will crash the entire node if a requested package doesn't exist - can an attacker trigger this by requesting non-existent package names to cause denial of service during transaction generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackagesBundle::get_package()] [Logic error] Does get_package perform any validation on the returned PrebuiltPackage data structure, or can corrupted/malicious package data be returned without checks, leading to execution of invalid Move bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackagesBundle::get_package()] [Memory safety] If the BTreeMap contains a package with extremely large modules or scripts vectors, can calling get_package cause memory exhaustion when the reference is used by downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::new()] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker pass arbitrary strings in the experiments vector to enable dangerous compiler optimizations or experimental features that bypass Move safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::new()] [Validation bypass] Does the experiments parameter undergo any validation, or can malformed/malicious experiment names be injected to cause compiler crashes or unexpected behavior during package building? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::build_options()] [Feature flag abuse] When latest_language is true, does it enable unstable language features that could introduce security vulnerabilities not present in stable Move, potentially allowing type confusion or resource safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::build_options()] [Override vulnerability] When use_local_std is true, does the StdVersion::Local override completely bypass the verified standard library, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious framework with backdoors or safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::build_options()] [Dev mode risk] The build_options.dev = true unconditionally enables development mode - does this disable critical security checks or enable debugging features that could leak sensitive information or bypass safety validations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: PrebuiltPackageConfig::build_options()] [Experiment injection] The for loop adding experiments via with_experiment() performs no validation - can an attacker inject compiler directives that disable safety checks, enable unsafe optimizations, or alter bytecode generation in exploitable ways?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Malicious package] Does BuiltPackage::build perform sufficient validation of the Move source code in package_path, or can an attacker provide a package with bytecode that violates Move VM safety properties but passes compilation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Path traversal] The package_path parameter from packages_to_build is passed directly to BuiltPackage::build - can an attacker provide paths containing '..' or symlinks to build packages from outside intended directories, including system directories?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Resource exhaustion] If packages_to_build contains many packages or very large packages, can building them all simultaneously cause memory exhaustion or CPU starvation, leading to denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Package name collision] The BTreeMap insert uses package.name() as the key - if two packages have identical names, will the later package silently overwrite the earlier one, potentially replacing legitimate packages with malicious versions?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Module validation] The package.module_code_iter().collect() gathers all module bytecode - are these modules validated for correctness, safety, and compliance with Move VM constraints, or can invalid bytecode be included?
