  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: test_transaction()] [Authentication bypass] Can the use of Ed25519Signature::dummy_signature() at line 77 allow attackers to bypass signature validation in production code if test utilities are accidentally imported, enabling unauthorized transaction execution and fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: test_transaction()] [Key generation weakness] Does the Ed25519PrivateKey::generate_for_testing() at line 61 use weak randomness that could be predictable in test environments, potentially allowing attackers to derive private keys and sign fraudulent transactions? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: FaData::create_change()] [Balance manipulation] Can attackers craft transactions with self.amount = 0 to manipulate state without actual value transfer, bypassing economic security checks or triggering unexpected behavior in balance tracking?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: FaData::create_change()] [Negative amount bypass] Can attackers pass negative values cast as u64 for self.amount to reverse the intended operation (e.g., withdraw becomes deposit), stealing funds or minting tokens? (Critical)",
