  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Incomplete Shutdown] Does executor_service.shutdown() properly wait for all in-flight transactions to complete, or can premature shutdown cause partially executed blocks and state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Network Controller Shutdown Race] If shutdown() is called while ExecutorService is processing a block, can the NetworkController shutdown (line 70 in remote_executor_service.rs) cause in-flight RPC calls to fail, corrupting execution results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Thread Join Timeout] Does the shutdown process wait for the executor thread (spawned at line 62-66 in remote_executor_service.rs) to terminate, or can the thread be orphaned and continue executing after shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Channel Cleanup] When NetworkController shuts down, are all crossbeam channels properly closed, or can blocked receivers cause deadlocks preventing clean shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [State Persistence] Does shutdown() ensure that all execution results are persisted and acknowledged before terminating, or can sudden shutdown cause loss of transaction outputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: drop()] [Drop Order Dependency] At lines 52-56, Drop calls shutdown() - if shutdown() expects certain resources to still be valid, can the automatic drop order of struct fields cause use-after-free or double-free? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: drop()] [Panic in Drop] If shutdown() panics during drop (e.g., due to already-dropped resources), does this cause std::terminate() to be called, crashing the entire process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: drop()] [Resource Leak on Panic] If an earlier panic prevented Drop from running, are executor_service resources (threads, network sockets, memory) leaked permanently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: drop()] [Concurrent Drop] Can multiple threads trigger Drop simultaneously (e.g., through Arc::drop), causing race conditions in the shutdown sequence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard ID Spoofing] Can a malicious process claim to be a different shard_id than assigned, causing it to receive/execute the wrong transactions and break cross-shard dependency chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Coordinator Impersonation] If the coordinator_address is compromised or spoofed, can an attacker send malicious ExecuteBlockCommand requests to shards, causing them to execute invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Cross-Shard Message Authentication] Is there authentication/encryption on messages between coordinator and shards, or can an attacker intercept and modify execution commands in transit? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard Address Mismatch] If remote_shard_addresses[i] doesn't match the actual address of shard i, can this cause cross-shard state reads to fail or return incorrect data, breaking execution determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Partition Handling] If some shards in remote_shard_addresses become unreachable, does the system detect this and halt execution, or does it proceed with partial results causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Byzantine Shard Detection] Can a malicious shard return incorrect execution results to the coordinator, and does the coordinator have mechanisms to detect and reject invalid shard outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Cross-Shard Deadlock] If shards wait for each other in circular dependency (shard 0 waits for 1, 1 waits for 0), can this create deadlock halting all execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard Synchronization] Are shards synchronized to process the same block at the same time, or can timing skew cause shards to execute different blocks, leading to state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Unencrypted Network Communication] Does the NetworkController use TLS/encryption, or are execution commands and state data transmitted in plaintext, allowing eavesdropping and tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Man-in-the-Middle Attack] Can an attacker positioned between coordinator and shards intercept ExecuteBlockCommand messages and inject malicious transactions or dependencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Port Binding Failure] At line 24, self_address is used to bind a network listener - if the port is already in use, does initialization fail gracefully or create silent errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Socket Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause the shard to create excessive socket connections through repeated connection attempts, exhausting file descriptors and preventing legitimate communication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Timeout Exploitation] The NetworkController uses a 5000ms timeout (line 158 in remote_executor_client.rs) - can an attacker deliberately delay responses to trigger timeouts and cause execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Message Size Limits] Are there limits on the size of messages sent between coordinator and shards, or can an attacker send extremely large ExecuteBlockCommand messages causing OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker capture and replay old ExecuteBlockCommand messages to cause shards to re-execute old blocks, creating confusion or state corruption? (High)",
