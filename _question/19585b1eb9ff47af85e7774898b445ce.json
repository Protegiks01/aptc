  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Resource: CPU] [Expensive Field Access] Are the accessor methods (get_sender, get_replay_protector, etc.) called in hot loops without caching, causing excessive CPU usage from repeated field extraction that degrades mempool throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Consistency: timeline_state] [State Desynchronization] If timeline_state transitions don't properly synchronize with the actual timeline index structures, can transactions be in Ready state in MempoolTransaction but not exist in the timeline, causing consensus to fail to find broadcastable transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Consistency: ranking_score] [Score Update Lag] If ranking_score becomes stale after gas price updates but MempoolTransaction isn't updated, can this cause priority queue inconsistencies where transactions are ordered by outdated scores? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Consistency: submitted_by] [Classification Drift] Can the submitted_by classification in InsertionInfo become inconsistent with the transaction's actual source if peer relationships change after insertion, causing incorrect latency attribution? (Low)"
