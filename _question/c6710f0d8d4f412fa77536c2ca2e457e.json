(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Path Traversal] Does the function check if the path resolves to a location within the expected test directory, or could absolute paths (e.g., '/etc/shadow') be used to read system files?
