  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Unicode handling] Do the String fields properly handle all Unicode code points including those in supplementary planes, or could invalid Unicode cause issues in event processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Verification gap] Since events are separate from state mutations, can the blockchain state and event log become inconsistent if a transaction partially succeeds (state changes but event emission fails)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Rollback handling] If a transaction is rolled back, are emitted TokenMutationEvents properly discarded, or could they persist in event logs despite the mutation never occurring? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Proof generation] Can validators generate compact proofs that a specific TokenMutationEvent was emitted, or does the lack of cryptographic commitment in the struct make fraud proofs impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: mutated_field_name()] [API exposure] If this getter is exposed through REST APIs, could attackers query mutation events to extract sensitive information about token operations they shouldn't have access to? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [JSON serialization] When TokenMutationEvent is serialized to JSON for API responses, are the String fields properly escaped to prevent injection attacks in client applications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Schema evolution] If the struct needs additional fields in the future (e.g., token_id, mutation_type), can old TokenMutationEvents be deserialized into the new format without breaking historical data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [Address migration] If TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS changes in a network upgrade, would existing events become unqueryable or would the type mismatch cause validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV1Type] [Event version] Does implementing MoveEventV1Type prevent this event from being used in newer event systems, or could version conflicts cause events to be dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Indexer parsing] Can indexers reliably parse TokenMutationEvent without access to the Move module source, or does the lack of schema information make off-chain processing error-prone? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Mutation ordering] If multiple fields are mutated in a single transaction, can the ordering of TokenMutationEvents be manipulated to hide critical changes among noise? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: mutated_field_name] [Reserved fields] Are there any field names that should never appear in mutation events (e.g., system-only fields), and is there enforcement to prevent their inclusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Mutation completeness] Can a transaction emit a TokenMutationEvent for only some of multiple related field changes, creating incomplete audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Fuzz testing] Has try_from_bytes() been fuzz-tested with randomized byte sequences to ensure it handles all possible malformed inputs gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Property testing] Are there property-based tests verifying that round-trip serialization/deserialization preserves all event data exactly? (Low)"
