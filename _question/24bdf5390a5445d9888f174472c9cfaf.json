  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Function: PackageMetadata::default()] [Default package name] The default PackageMetadata creates a package named 'some_package' - could this collide with an actual package in a registry? Could default values mask missing required fields in validation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Function: Version::default()] [Version 0.0.0 handling] The default version is 0.0.0 - is this treated specially by version comparison logic? Could packages with version 0.0.0 bypass version checks or be incorrectly considered as 'pre-release' or 'unversioned'? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Function: PackageManifest::default()] [Empty manifest security] Default() creates a valid but minimal manifest - could build systems accidentally use default manifests for critical packages if parsing fails silently, causing dependency confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/util.rs] [Function: render_error()] [Span information leak] The error renderer displays source spans from the manifest - could error messages reveal sensitive information like file paths, internal package names, or structural details that aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/util.rs] [Function: render_error()] [Snippet context leak] annotate_snippets shows source context around errors - could this leak portions of proprietary manifest files or internal dependency structures in public error logs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/util.rs] [Function: render_error()] [Write trait DoS] The function writes to an impl Write - if the writer is a network socket or slow device, could an attacker trigger parsing errors to cause blocking I/O and DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/util.rs] [Function: render_error()] [Error message injection] The err.message() is displayed directly - if TOML parsing errors contain unsanitized user input, could this lead to log injection or terminal escape sequence attacks when errors are displayed? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Impl: DerefMut for NamedAddress] [Mutable deref bypass] DerefMut allows mutation of the inner String - can code that obtains &mut NamedAddress bypass validation by directly modifying the string to an invalid value? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/named_address.rs] [Impl: AsMut for NamedAddress] [Validation bypass via AsMut] AsMut<str> provides mutable access to the inner string - does this allow external code to violate validation invariants by modifying a NamedAddress after construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Impl: DerefMut for PackageName] [Mutable deref bypass] Similar to NamedAddress, DerefMut could allow validation bypass - can critical package names be mutated to invalid or malicious values after validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Impl: AsMut for PackageName] [Package name mutation attack] If PackageName is mutated after validation, could this allow an attacker to change a dependency from 'aptos-framework' to 'malicious-framework' mid-build? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageManifest] [Public field mutation] All fields of PackageManifest are public - can external code bypass validation by directly constructing PackageManifest with invalid data instead of deserializing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Version field access] The version field is private but location is public - could inconsistent access control allow partial validation bypass where location is manipulated without re-validating version compatibility? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_package_manifest()] [Concurrent parsing safety] If multiple threads parse manifests concurrently, are there any shared mutable state or global caches in toml::from_str() that could cause race conditions or data races? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageManifest] [BTreeMap concurrent access] If a PackageManifest is shared across threads (via Arc), can concurrent reads of the BTreeMaps cause issues, or could iterators be invalidated by concurrent modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: dependencies] [Transitive dependency attack] Can an attacker register a package with no direct malicious code but malicious transitive dependencies that get pulled in automatically, bypassing security reviews that only check direct dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: dependencies] [Circular dependency DoS] Is there protection against circular dependencies (A depends on B, B depends on A)? Could an attacker create circular dependency chains that cause infinite loops in dependency resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: dependencies] [Dependency count limit] Is there a limit on the number of dependencies? Can an attacker create a package with thousands of dependencies to cause memory exhaustion or DoS during dependency resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Enum: PackageLocation] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] For Git and Aptos dependencies, is there protection against TOCTOU attacks where a dependency is validated as safe but replaced with malicious code between validation and actual use? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Enum: PackageLocation] [Dependency pinning bypass] Git dependencies with 'rev' provide pinning, but local dependencies are by path - can an attacker exploit the difference to swap local dependencies after validation but before build? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: addresses] [Address assignment timing] Are named addresses resolved at parse time or compile time? If compile time, could an attacker exploit late binding to change address meanings between manifest parsing and actual compilation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: addresses] [Framework address shadowing] Can a malicious package define named addresses that shadow critical framework addresses (like 'aptos_framework' or 'std'), causing user code to accidentally call malicious contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Field: dev_addresses] [Test-to-production leak] Dev addresses are supposed to be test-only - is there robust enforcement preventing dev_addresses from being used in production builds? Could a build system misconfiguration cause test addresses to leak into production? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Enum: AddressAssignment::Numerical] [Address validation] When a numerical address is provided, is it validated to be a valid AccountAddress format for the target network? Could invalid addresses pass parsing but fail at deployment time, causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_package_manifest()] [TOML bomb - array expansion] Can an attacker create a TOML with thousands of duplicate entries in authors[] or dependencies{} to cause memory exhaustion during deserialization? (Medium)"
