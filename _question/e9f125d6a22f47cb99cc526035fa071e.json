  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SENDER] [Sender address spoofing] Can manipulation of the SENDER flag during compilation allow an attacker to compile Move code that appears to originate from a privileged address (like governance or framework address), bypassing access control checks when deployed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SENDER_SHORT] [Flag parsing vulnerability] Are short flags properly validated to prevent an attacker from using '-s' with carefully crafted values that could be misinterpreted as multiple flags, potentially enabling unauthorized compilation options or bypassing security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: Multiple flags] [Flag combination attack] Can combining SKIP_ATTRIBUTE_CHECKS + SHADOW + disabled VERIFY flags create a compilation mode where malicious Move code bypasses all safety checks, allowing deployment of modules that violate resource safety and enable double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: DEBUG_FLAG + MOVE_COMPILER_DUMP_ENV_VAR] [Debug dump combination] If both DEBUG_FLAG and MOVE_COMPILER_DUMP_ENV_VAR are enabled simultaneously, does this create excessive logging that leaks validator state, consensus round details, or cryptographic parameters that could aid in attacking the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: OUT_DIR + MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR] [Path traversal combination] Can combining relative paths in OUT_DIR with MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR create path traversal vulnerabilities that write compiled bytecode outside the intended sandbox, potentially overwriting critical Aptos validator binaries or configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: TEST + LANGUAGE_VERSION] [Test version mismatch] If TEST mode is enabled with a mismatched LANGUAGE_VERSION, could this cause test-only code to be compiled using incompatible language semantics, leading to deployment of modules that behave differently in production than in testing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Function: get_move_compiler_backtrace_from_env()] [Boolean parsing ambiguity] Does read_bool_env_var properly handle malformed boolean values like '0xTrue', 'yes', '2', or empty strings, and can ambiguous parsing be exploited to enable backtrace logging when it should be disabled, leaking sensitive validator internals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Function: get_move_compiler_backtrace_from_env()] [OR logic vulnerability] The function uses OR logic between two environment variables - if one variable is controlled by a restricted user and another by root, can the attacker-controlled variable override security settings to force backtrace exposure regardless of admin configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Function: get_move_compiler_backtrace_from_env()] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerability where environment variables can be modified between when get_move_compiler_backtrace_from_env() reads them and when backtrace logging actually occurs, allowing temporary privilege escalation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR] [Non-deterministic compilation] If validators use different DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR values due to environment differences, could this cause compilation artifacts to differ across nodes, leading to validators producing different bytecode for the same governance proposal and causing consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SOURCE_MAP] [Determinism violation] Does SOURCE_MAP generation include non-deterministic elements like timestamps, filesystem paths, or user information that could cause validators to produce different source maps for identical Move code, breaking consensus on compilation outputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: Environment variables] [Environmental non-determinism] If different validators have different environment variable settings (DEBUG, DUMP, COLOR_MODE), could this cause them to produce different diagnostic outputs or compilation behavior that leads to state divergence and network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: MOVE_COMPILER_DUMP_ENV_VAR] [Resource exhaustion] Can enabling MOVE_COMPILER_DUMP_ENV_VAR cause excessive disk writes of bytecode dumps during compilation of large governance proposals, exhausting validator storage and causing them to fall behind consensus, triggering liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: DEBUG_FLAG] [CPU exhaustion] Does enabling DEBUG_FLAG with verbose output cause significant CPU overhead during Move compilation that could slow down validator block processing, allowing an attacker to degrade network performance by submitting complex modules for compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SOURCE_MAP] [Memory exhaustion] Can requesting SOURCE_MAP generation for extremely large Move modules cause excessive memory consumption during compilation, potentially triggering OOM conditions on validators and causing them to crash during critical governance proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR] [Interface cache poisoning] If MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR points to a shared or network-mounted directory, can an attacker poison the interface cache with malicious type definitions that affect all subsequent compilations, causing validators to accept invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR] [Symlink attack] Can the MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR path be a symlink to sensitive directories, causing interface generation to read from or write to unauthorized locations, potentially exposing private keys or validator configuration?
