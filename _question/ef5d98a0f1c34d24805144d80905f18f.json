  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_named_addresses()] [Case Sensitivity] Does the parsing handle case variations in hex addresses (0x1 vs 0X1) consistently, or can case manipulation lead to address collisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_files()] [Extension Spoofing] Can files with doubled extensions like '.move.txt' or '.move\\x00.rs' bypass the extension_equals check and inject non-Move content into compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_nursery_files()] [Case Sensitivity] Does extension_equals perform case-insensitive matching on all platforms, or can attackers use '.Move' or '.MOVE' files to bypass filtering on case-sensitive filesystems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: error_descriptions()] [Data Tampering] Can runtime memory corruption or code injection modify the static ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS byte array, causing validators to use compromised error mappings? (High)",
