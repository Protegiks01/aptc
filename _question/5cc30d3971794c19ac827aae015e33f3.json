  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: Token] [Enum Serialization] Does the serde rename_all='snake_case' at line 102 create any ambiguity between FromConfig and FromDisk that could lead to type confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Field Ordering] Can the order of fields during deserialization affect security, such as token being read before validation of other fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Enum: SecureBackend] [Backend Selection] Can misconfigurations cause production validators to accidentally use InMemoryStorage, resulting in permanent loss of validator keys and inability to participate in consensus after restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: Token] [Production Token Storage] Does using Token::FromConfig in production environments expose tokens in configuration management systems, backups, or version control, allowing mass compromise of validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Migration Safety] When migrating from one backend type to another (e.g., OnDisk to Vault), is there validation that keys exist in the new backend before switching, or can migrations cause validators to lose access to keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Sensitive Field Logging] Are server URLs with embedded credentials ever logged when VaultConfig is serialized for debugging or monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Token Logging] If token reading fails, do error messages avoid including the token value or file contents in debug output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Empty Namespace] What happens if namespace is Some('') (empty string) rather than None - does this create an effective namespace or bypass namespace isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::clear_namespace()] [Security Impact] When clear_namespace() removes namespace isolation, are there any access control checks to prevent unauthorized namespace removal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Error Context Loss] When File::open() fails at line 156, does wrapping in Error::IO preserve the original error code (EACCES vs ENOENT), or could permission errors be misinterpreted as missing files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Path Unwrapping] At line 156, does path.to_str().unwrap() properly handle non-UTF8 paths, or can this panic with malicious filesystem paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [OnDiskStorage Security] When creating OnDiskStorage at line 168, does the underlying implementation ensure atomic writes and secure file permissions for validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [VaultStorage Retry] If VaultStorage initialization fails at line 176-187, is there retry logic that could amplify DoS attacks or cause validator startup delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Windows Path Handling] On Windows systems, are UNC paths, drive letters, and path separators handled correctly, or can path resolution differ from Unix systems causing security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [URL Scheme Validation] Does VaultConfig validate that the server URL uses HTTPS rather than HTTP, preventing cleartext transmission of validator keys and tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [File Handle Leaks] If read_token() is called repeatedly, are file handles properly closed, or can file descriptor exhaustion occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: OnDiskStorageConfig] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems, can variations in path casing cause validators to access different storage locations than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Panic Safety] If any of the expect()/unwrap() calls panic during Storage conversion, is the panic handler configured to avoid leaking sensitive configuration data in crash reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Token Renewal Race] If renew_ttl_secs is set but token renewal fails partway through validator operation, can the validator continue operating with an expired token, causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Large File DoS] Can providing paths to extremely large files (e.g., /dev/sda) cause memory exhaustion when read_to_string() attempts to load the entire file? (High)",
