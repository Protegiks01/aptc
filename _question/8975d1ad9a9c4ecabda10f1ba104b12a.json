  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/secp256k1_ecdsa.rs] [Feature: fuzzing] [Test code in production] The sign_arbitrary_message() function at lines 54-60 is only available with 'test' or 'fuzzing' features - can attackers enable fuzzing in production to bypass message hashing and sign arbitrary raw messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/secp256k1_ecdsa.rs] [Feature: fuzzing] [Bypassing CryptoHash] If fuzzing features are enabled, can attackers use sign_arbitrary_message() at line 55 to sign messages without proper domain separation, enabling cross-context signature reuse attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/secp256k1_ecdsa.rs] [Trait: Signature] [Verify generic] The verify<T: CryptoHash>() method at line 267 accepts any CryptoHash type - can this enable signature reuse across different transaction types or protocol messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/secp256k1_ecdsa.rs] [Trait: Length] [Length consistency] Do all Length trait implementations return consistent values with the actual serialization length, or can mismatches cause buffer overflows in calling code? (Medium)",
