  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new()] [Error swallowing] serde_json::to_vec() errors are propagated via Result - but what if upstream callers ignore these errors? Can serialization failures go undetected, causing incomplete responses to be sent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Silent header insertion failures] HeaderValue::from() conversions could fail - but there's no error handling. Can failed header insertions cause responses to be missing critical metadata without errors being raised? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new()] [Unbounded serialization] Generic type T: Serialize has no size bounds - can attackers instantiate T with recursive or infinite types that cause serialization to loop forever? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new_bcs()] [BCS size limits] bcs::to_bytes() has no explicit size limit - can extremely large structures cause multi-gigabyte allocations that OOM the server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response struct] [Body vector capacity] Vec<u8> body has no maximum capacity - can this lead to memory exhaustion if serialization produces unbounded output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Missing integrity checks] Response body has no MAC or signature - can man-in-the-middle attackers modify responses in transit without detection? (Note: likely handled at TLS layer, but worth verifying) (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response struct] [No version correlation] There's no cryptographic proof that body matches the ledger_version in headers - can attackers serve body from version N with headers claiming version M? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new()] [Validator DoS] If this webserver runs on validator nodes, can attackers flood requests triggering expensive new() serialization calls, degrading consensus performance below liveness thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Header manipulation by Byzantine validators] Can Byzantine validators craft malicious ledger_info with incorrect epoch/block_height values to confuse clients or other validators about chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Zero values handling] What happens if ledger_version, epoch, or block_height are 0 (genesis state)? Can special handling of zero values cause edge case bugs in header parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Negative timestamp] While timestamps are u64, can wraparound or incorrect conversions elsewhere cause timestamps that appear negative when cast, breaking time-based security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Oldest > Current paradox] If oldest_ledger_version > ledger_version or oldest_block_height > block_height due to bugs, can this cause integer underflows or logic errors in clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response struct] [Immutability] Response fields are all public - can external code mutate Response after creation but before into_response(), causing inconsistent responses to be sent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Non-idempotent consumption] into_response() consumes self - can code incorrectly try to reuse Response instances, causing panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [HTTP spec compliance] Are custom X-Aptos-* headers compliant with HTTP specifications? Can non-compliant headers cause proxies or CDNs to drop requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Header ordering] Does header insertion order matter? Can different ordering cause parsing issues in strict HTTP clients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: new_bcs()] [BCS version skew] If different validator versions use different BCS serialization implementations, can this cause deserialization failures or consensus disagreements? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Epoch confusion] X-Aptos-Epoch header could be from old epoch while body is from new epoch - can epoch boundaries cause timing attacks or state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Block height manipulation] Can attackers provide fake block_height values to make clients think chain is longer/shorter than reality, affecting finality assumptions? (High)",
