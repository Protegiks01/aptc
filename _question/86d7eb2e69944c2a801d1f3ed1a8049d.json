  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [Multisig Filtering] When filtering Multisig transactions, are both the multisig_address and inner transaction payload properly filtered, or can attackers hide malicious payloads inside multisig wrappers? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [FeePayer Transactions] Can FeePayer transactions bypass filters by distributing suspicious addresses across sender, secondary_signers, and fee_payer fields, with no single field triggering filters? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [MultiAgent Transactions] Can MultiAgent transactions with many secondary_signers cause performance issues during filtering if each signer must be checked against PublicKey or AccountAddress filters? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [Abstract Authenticator] Can Abstract authenticator's function_info.module_address be used to impersonate filtered addresses, or is it properly validated by AccountAddress matchers? (Medium)",

  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [EncryptedPayload Decryption Failure] If EncryptedPayload.executable_ref() returns an error during filtering, are these transactions rejected or allowed by default, potentially bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [Payload V1 Filtering] Are TransactionPayload::Payload(TransactionPayloadInner::V1) transactions properly filtered, or can future payload versions bypass current filter implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [Script Transactions] Can Script transactions bypass EntryFunction and ModuleAddress filters since they don't call specific modules, potentially executing arbitrary bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 24] [ModuleBundle Transactions] Are ModuleBundle transactions (publishing multiple modules) filtered, or can attackers publish malicious modules that bypass module address filters? (High)",

  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 59] [Batch-Transaction Mismatch] If BatchTransactionFilter has both batch-level and transaction-level matchers, can attackers exploit rule ordering to make batch matchers override transaction matchers or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 70-72] [Batch Filter is_enabled()] If batch filter is disabled during batch voting, can malicious batches be certified by validators, even though they would be rejected during block execution? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 59] [Empty Batch Handling] How are empty batches handled by BatchTransactionFilter - are they allowed or denied by default, and can this be exploited for resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [Block Author Filtering] When filtering by block Author, does None author (for genesis or special blocks) bypass Author filters, potentially allowing malicious genesis transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 94] [Block ID Prediction] Can attackers predict future BlockIds to craft transactions that will match BlockId filters at specific future blocks? (Low)",
