(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the version <= ledger_version check at line 48 by manipulating ledger_version to return future transactions that haven't been fully committed, causing state inconsistency across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Race condition] Is there a TOCTOU race between retrieving version from OrderedTransactionByAccountSchema and checking version <= ledger_version, where ledger_version could be updated concurrently causing inconsistent reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Replay attack] Does this function properly validate that sequence numbers are unique per account, or can an attacker exploit missing validation to query duplicate sequence numbers causing transaction replay vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [State inconsistency] If OrderedTransactionByAccountSchema returns a version but that transaction is being pruned concurrently, can this create inconsistent state where the version exists in the index but not in the transaction store? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Access control] Can an attacker query versions for system accounts or validator accounts to extract sensitive transaction patterns that could be exploited for MEV or front-running attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Database error handling] If ledger_db.transaction_db_raw().get() fails with a database corruption error, does error propagation properly halt operations, or can partial results be returned causing state divergence?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Optional handling] Does the Option<Version> return properly distinguish between 'transaction not found' vs 'transaction exists but version > ledger_version', or can this ambiguity be exploited to hide transaction existence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction_version()] [Consensus impact] If this function returns inconsistent versions across validators due to timing differences in ledger_version updates, could this cause consensus failures or block proposal rejections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions_iter()] [Integer overflow] The checked_add at line 77 prevents overflow, but does the error message in AptosDbError::TooManyRequested properly prevent attackers from using u64::MAX as num_versions to cause denial of service or resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions_iter()] [Sequence gap exploitation] The function guarantees sequential sequence numbers, but can an attacker exploit missing sequence numbers in the database to cause the iterator to return incomplete transaction sets, hiding critical transactions from API consumers?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions_iter()] [Iterator positioning] If iter.seek() at line 72 fails or positions incorrectly, can this cause the iterator to return transactions from wrong accounts, violating account isolation and leaking transaction data?
