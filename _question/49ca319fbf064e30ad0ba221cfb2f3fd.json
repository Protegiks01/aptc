  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: is_terminated()] [Stream termination race] Can consensus continue sending notifications after the listener stream is terminated, causing lost commits and state desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationListener] [Channel closure attack] If notification_receiver is closed prematurely, do all pending notifications in the channel get dropped, potentially losing committed transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Send after close] Does the notification_sender.send operation check if the receiver is closed before queuing messages, or can it queue messages that will never be processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Polling after termination] Can calling poll_next after is_terminated returns true cause undefined behavior or panics in the stream implementation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotifier] [Sender drop behavior] If all ConsensusNotifier instances are dropped, does the channel close gracefully, or can state sync hang waiting for notifications that will never come? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_consensus_notifier_listener_pair()] [Channel lifetime mismatch] Can the notifier outlive the listener or vice versa, causing one side to block indefinitely waiting for the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Commit ordering violation] Can out-of-order commit notifications cause different validators to apply the same transactions in different orders, leading to state divergence and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Reorg attack] Can a malicious consensus force state sync to sync to an old target repeatedly, causing state sync to constantly revert and preventing the node from catching up to the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Partial commit attack] If consensus crashes after sending part of a batch of transactions, can state sync be left in an inconsistent state with only some transactions committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Duration manipulation] Can an attacker repeatedly call sync_for_duration with zero duration to force state sync into a tight loop, causing CPU exhaustion and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Conflicting sync targets] Can consensus send multiple sync_to_target notifications with conflicting targets simultaneously, causing state sync to fork or sync to the wrong chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Event-transaction mismatch] Can subscribable_events reference transactions that aren't in the transactions vec, causing event processors to fail or process events incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Sync progress tracking] If multiple sync_for_duration operations overlap, can the returned ledger info be from a different sync operation, confusing consensus about actual sync progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Commit replay] Is there any mechanism preventing consensus from sending the same commit notification twice, potentially causing double-application of transactions and state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ConsensusNotificationSender] [No authentication] Does the interface verify that notifications actually come from legitimate consensus components, or can any component with access to ConsensusNotifier send arbitrary commit notifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_consensus_notifier_listener_pair()] [Channel hijacking] Can a malicious component obtain the notification_sender handle and impersonate consensus, sending fake commits to trick state sync into applying invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Sender verification] Is there any cryptographic verification that commit notifications are signed by authorized validators, or can any holder of ConsensusNotifier send commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Target authority check] Does sync_to_target verify that the target LedgerInfoWithSignatures has valid validator signatures, or does it blindly trust whatever consensus provides? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotifier] [Clone permission] Can unauthorized components clone the ConsensusNotifier and gain ability to send notifications, bypassing any intended access controls? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ConsensusNotificationSender] [Implementation substitution] Can an attacker provide a malicious implementation of ConsensusNotificationSender that bypasses security checks while appearing legitimate? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusCommitNotification] [Field tampering] Can the internal fields (transactions, subscribable_events, callback) be modified after construction but before state sync processes them, leading to inconsistent data? (Medium)",
