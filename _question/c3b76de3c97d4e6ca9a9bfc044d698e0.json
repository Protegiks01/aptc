  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Secret leakage] Can the SilentDebug and SilentDisplay derives be bypassed through reflection, unsafe code, or serialization to leak the secret field 'a' during logging or debugging operations, allowing an attacker to compromise the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory safety] Does the InputSecret struct properly zero its memory when dropped, or can secret values persist in memory after deallocation, allowing memory scraping attacks to recover secret keys from validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Side-channel] Are field operations on the secret 'a' constant-time, or can timing attacks during arithmetic operations leak information about the secret value through observable execution time differences?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Function: generate()] [Weak RNG] Can the generate() function be called with a weak or compromised RNG (violating the CryptoRng bound), allowing attackers to predict future secret values and break the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG state] If multiple validators call generate() with the same RNG state or seed, can this lead to secret collisions where multiple participants generate identical secrets, compromising threshold security?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Zero detection] Does the DKG protocol properly validate that input secrets are non-zero before using them in dealing, or can zero secrets bypass validation and compromise threshold cryptography? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Function: zero()] [Identity element abuse] Can the zero() constructor be misused to create neutral elements that, when aggregated with other secrets, effectively nullify contributions from honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Timing attack] Does is_zero() perform constant-time comparison, or can timing differences reveal whether a secret is zero, leaking sensitive information during DKG verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Zero] [Aggregation bypass] Can malicious validators exploit the Zero trait implementation to inject zero contributions during secret aggregation, effectively removing honest participants from the final shared secret?
