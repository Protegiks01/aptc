  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Transaction Ordering] Does the method guarantee strict ordering by sequence number, or can implementors return transactions out-of-order breaking transaction replay determinism and causing consensus divergence if used for state sync? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Proof Completeness] Can the proofs in AccountOrderedTransactionsWithProof be incomplete or malformed, allowing clients to accept invalid transactions as valid, potentially accepting double-spends or forged transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Iterator Invalidation] Can the returned iterator become invalid if the underlying state changes during iteration due to concurrent ledger updates, causing iterator to return inconsistent snapshots or panic with poisoned locks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Prefix Injection] Can malicious StateKeyPrefix values containing special characters or escape sequences exploit implementor string handling to bypass prefix filtering and iterate over unrelated state entries, leaking sensitive state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Cursor Manipulation] Can the cursor parameter be crafted to skip state entries, repeat entries, or jump to arbitrary state positions breaking iteration consistency and allowing attackers to enumerate state in exploitable patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does the iterator load all matching state values into memory at once, or can implementors stream lazily? If eager, can attackers provide broad prefixes matching millions of entries to exhaust node memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Version Inconsistency] Is the version parameter enforced throughout iteration, or can some StateValue entries come from different versions if implementors don't properly snapshot the state, causing inconsistent state reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Lifetime Violation] The iterator borrows self with lifetime '_, but can this lead to dangling references if implementors incorrectly manage internal buffers or caches that outlive the IndexerReader instance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Error Propagation] Iterator items are Result types - can implementors mask critical errors (like corruption or auth failures) as Ok values, or conversely emit spurious errors that cause clients to retry infinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Prefix Overlaps] When multiple prefixes overlap (e.g., '0x1' and '0x1a'), can implementors return entries multiple times or in undefined order breaking iteration determinism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version()] [Stale Version] Can implementors cache this value and return stale versions, causing queries to operate on outdated indexed data and missing recent transactions that have already committed to the ledger? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version()] [None Handling] When this returns None, do callers properly handle the unindexed state, or can this cause null pointer dereferences or unwrap panics in downstream code that assumes indexer is always available? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version()] [Version Regression] Can this method ever return a version lower than a previously returned version due to indexer rollbacks or race conditions, violating monotonicity assumptions and causing clients to re-process already-seen transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version()] [Cross-Method Inconsistency] Can this method return version V while other query methods still operate on version V-N due to indexing lag, causing visible inconsistencies where latest version claims data is indexed but queries return empty results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_table_info_ledger_version()] [Indexer Lag] Can this return a version far behind get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version(), causing table info queries to fail for recently created tables even though general indexing appears current? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_latest_table_info_ledger_version()] [Table Info Corruption] If table info indexing becomes corrupted, can this method still return Ok(Some(version)) masking the corruption and causing get_table_info() to return invalid or missing data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: wait_for_internal_indexer()] [Infinite Loop] In the busy-wait loop (lines 67-72), if get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version() always returns Err or Some(v) where v never reaches the target version due to indexer failure, can this method hang forever blocking the calling thread indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: wait_for_internal_indexer()] [Resource Exhaustion] The 200ms sleep interval between checks can cause CPU spinning if the indexer is far behind - can an attacker trigger scenarios where many threads wait simultaneously exhausting thread pools and degrading node performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: wait_for_internal_indexer()] [Error Handling] The method propagates errors from get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version() with ?, but can transient errors cause premature termination of legitimate waits, breaking test synchronization or causing flakey test failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: wait_for_internal_indexer()] [Version Equality] The condition 'v < version' means it waits while indexed version is strictly less than target, but what if version overflows or wraps, can this create off-by-one errors where it returns prematurely before target version is actually indexed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: wait_for_internal_indexer()] [Test-Only Exposure] This method is only available under test/fuzzing features, but can production code accidentally depend on it via feature flag misconfiguration, or can fuzzing expose implementation-specific timing vulnerabilities that exist in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_translated_v1_event_by_version_and_index()] [Index Out of Bounds] Can the index parameter exceed the actual number of events at the given version, causing implementors to panic, return wrong events, or fabricate events rather than returning proper errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_translated_v1_event_by_version_and_index()] [Version Validation] Is there validation that the version parameter refers to a committed transaction version, or can queries for non-existent/future versions cause implementors to return arbitrary data or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_translated_v1_event_by_version_and_index()] [Translation Correctness] Does the translation from V2 to V1 event format preserve all semantic information, or can the conversion lose critical event data causing downstream consumers to misinterpret event effects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_translated_v1_event_by_version_and_index()] [Event Type Confusion] Can implementors return a V1 event of a different type than expected, breaking type safety assumptions in callers who expect specific event schemas and potentially causing deserialization failures or logic errors? (Medium)"
