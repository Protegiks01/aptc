  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information disclosure] Can the optional 'author' field expose validator identity information in logs that could be correlated across different consensus events to map validator behavior patterns and enable targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information disclosure] Does the 'remote_peer' field log Byzantine validator identities in a way that could leak sensitive network topology information to attackers monitoring log outputs? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Information disclosure] Do the 40+ distinct LogEvent types expose sufficient internal consensus state machine details that an attacker could reconstruct safety-critical protocol flows? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Serialization vulnerability] Does the Serialize derive macro for LogEvent properly sanitize enum variant names to prevent log injection attacks through crafted event names? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log injection] Can malicious validators craft Author, HashValue, or other field values containing newline characters or ANSI escape sequences to inject forged log entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Deserialization attack] If logs are ever re-parsed or ingested by monitoring systems, could crafted field values trigger deserialization vulnerabilities in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Derive macro: Schema] [Code generation vulnerability] Does the Schema derive macro generate builder methods that properly validate input types, or can type confusion attacks bypass expected constraints? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Data integrity] Are there any runtime checks ensuring that author, remote_peer, epoch, round, and id fields are set consistently for each LogEvent type? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Integrity violation] Can a malicious component log a ReceiveVote event with mismatched author and remote_peer fields to create false audit trails implicating honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Round manipulation] Is there validation preventing epoch/round values from being logged with impossible combinations (e.g., round > max_round for epoch) that could hide consensus violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Missing events] Are there critical consensus safety events (double-signing, equivocation detection, safety rule violations) that are NOT represented in the 40+ LogEvent variants? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Audit trail gap] Does the absence of 'VerifyProposal', 'ValidateVote', or 'CheckSafetyRules' events create audit trail gaps that prevent detection of Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Missing slashing events] Are validator slashing, penalty, or ejection events logged, or could malicious validators be penalized without auditable log evidence? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::ReceiveMessageFromDifferentEpoch] [Epoch attack detection] Does this single event provide sufficient detail to audit epoch confusion attacks, or are additional epoch validation events needed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent::Vote] [Equivocation logging] When Vote events are logged, is there sufficient context (block hash, round, validator signature) to detect double-voting attacks in log analysis? (High)",
