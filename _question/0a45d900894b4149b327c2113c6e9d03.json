  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing cross-module attacks] Does SecurityEvent fail to capture complex attacks spanning multiple components (e.g., mempool + consensus collusion, state-sync + network layer exploits)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing epoch transition events] Are critical epoch transition security events (validator set rotation attacks, reconfiguration exploits, epoch boundary race conditions) missing from the enum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing cryptographic events] Does SecurityEvent omit cryptographic security events (signature aggregation failures, VRF manipulation, hash collision attempts, key rotation exploits)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Enforcement vs logging] Is there a systemic risk that components log SecurityEvents but fail to ENFORCE security policies, creating a false sense of security while attacks succeed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Log flooding] Can a Byzantine validator or malicious peer trigger excessive SecurityEvent logging (e.g., sending thousands of invalid messages) to flood logs and hide real attacks or cause disk exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Race conditions] In concurrent scenarios where multiple threads detect the same security violation, could race conditions lead to duplicate or missing SecurityEvent logs affecting attack detection accuracy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Incomplete context] Do SecurityEvent logs lack critical context fields (timestamp, peer ID, transaction hash, block height) needed to correlate attacks and build evidence for slashing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Sampling bias] If security event logging uses sampling or rate limiting to reduce overhead, could attackers exploit low-frequency attacks that fall below the sampling threshold? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Ambiguous naming] Do similar-sounding variants (InvalidNetworkEvent vs InvalidNetworkEventMempool vs InvalidNetworkEventHC) cause confusion in security response, potentially routing incidents to wrong teams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing documentation] Do enum variants lack detailed doc comments explaining WHEN they should be logged, what data to include, and expected security response actions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [TODO comment] Does the TODO comment 'This likely belongs outside of the logging crate' indicate incomplete security architecture, suggesting this event system may be improperly integrated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Impl: Schema for SecurityEvent] [Visitor failures] What happens if visitor.visit_pair() fails during security event logging - is the failure silently ignored, potentially losing critical security events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization failures] If serde serialization of a SecurityEvent fails (e.g., due to invalid UTF-8 in attached data), could security events be silently dropped during high-severity attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing slashing integration] Do SecurityEvents lack direct integration with the slashing system, requiring manual analysis to punish Byzantine validators detected through these logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing reputation events] Are validator reputation changes (peer scoring, connection bans, temporary exclusions) missing from SecurityEvent, making it impossible to audit reputation system decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Severity levels] Do SecurityEvents lack severity classifications (Critical/High/Medium/Low), forcing security teams to manually triage which events require immediate response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing performance attacks] Does SecurityEvent fail to capture performance-based attacks (CPU exhaustion, memory overflow, disk I/O saturation) that could degrade consensus or cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing resource exhaustion] Are resource exhaustion attacks (connection flooding, large message attacks, state query abuse) missing from SecurityEvent variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Non-deterministic logging] Could non-deterministic logging behavior (different validators logging different SecurityEvents for the same attack) cause consensus issues or make attack correlation impossible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing state divergence events] Does SecurityEvent lack variants for state root mismatches between validators, preventing detection of execution non-determinism or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Alert integration] Is there a defined integration between SecurityEvent logs and real-time alerting systems, or could critical attacks go unnoticed until manual log review? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Metrics export] Are SecurityEvent occurrences exported as metrics (Prometheus, etc.) for monitoring dashboards, or is security visibility limited to log file analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [False positive rate] Is there tracking of false positive rates for each SecurityEvent variant to prevent alert fatigue and ensure real attacks are investigated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing finality events] Are finality-related attacks (finality reversals, checkpoint manipulation, last committed block exploits) missing from SecurityEvent coverage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing reconfiguration events] Does SecurityEvent fail to capture on-chain reconfiguration attacks that could modify consensus parameters, validator set, or protocol features maliciously? (Critical)"
