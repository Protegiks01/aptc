  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Edge Case] [Event Iterator Exhaustion] If the boxed iterator in map_id_to_values_events is already partially consumed before function call, can this cause events to be skipped or processed out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Serialization] [BCS Non-Determinism] Can the BTreeMap serialization in serialize_groups (line 150) produce non-deterministic byte representations if keys have unusual comparison behavior, causing state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Serialization] [Tag Collision] Can duplicate T::Tag values in the BTreeMap (lines 140-148) cause serialization to overwrite entries, leading to resource loss and fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Serialization] [Bytes Extraction Failure] Does the expect('Deletions should already be applied') on line 145 guarantee extract_raw_bytes never returns None, or can edge cases cause panics during group serialization? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Memory] [Vec Capacity Attack] Can attackers trigger excessive memory allocation through Vec::with_capacity calls (lines 211, 214) by providing inflated capacity hints from finalized_groups length? (Medium)",

(Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Error] [Expect Panic] Do the expect() calls on lines 145 and 339 have proper upstream validation to guarantee they never panic, or can edge cases cause unexpected validator crashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Error] [Unwrap Safety] Does the unwrap_or_else(Bytes::new) call on line 67 properly handle all None cases, or can unexpected None values indicate deeper state corruption that should halt execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Type Safety] [Layout Mismatch Attack] Can attackers provide mismatched MoveTypeLayout that passes randomly_check_layout_matches (line 64) but causes type confusion during actual value deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Type Safety] [ValueWithLayout Variant Confusion] Can the three variants of ValueWithLayout (RawFromStorage, Exchanged with/without layout) be confused through type manipulation, causing values to bypass ID replacement?
