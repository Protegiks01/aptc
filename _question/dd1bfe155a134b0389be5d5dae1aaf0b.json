  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: DIRECT_SEND] [DIRECT_SEND Usage] Are DIRECT_SEND protocols actually used for DKG, and if so, can message loss in DIRECT_SEND (vs reliable RPC) break DKG threshold requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Protocol Fallback] If primary RPC protocol fails, does send_rpc() have fallback logic, or does a single protocol failure abort the entire DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [HashMap Collision] Can PeerId hash collisions in the returned HashMap cause transcript data to be overwritten or lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Vector Capacity] Does to_bytes_by_protocol() pre-allocate HashMap capacity based on peers vector length, or can this cause multiple reallocations for large validator sets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timing Side-Channel] Can timing differences in send_rpc() reveal information about DKG transcript content or validator set composition? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization Timing] Can serialization time variations in to_bytes_by_protocol() leak information about DKG message structure to network observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout Configuration] Are rpc_timeout values properly bounded by configuration, or can misconfigured timeouts cause all DKG RPCs to fail immediately or hang indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: RPC] [Protocol Configuration] Can the RPC protocol list be modified at runtime, and if so, can this cause inconsistent protocol usage across validator restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [EpochManager Integration] Does send_rpc() coordinate with EpochManager to ensure DKG messages are only sent during valid DKG windows, or can off-schedule messages break protocol invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Transcript Aggregation] Does to_bytes_by_protocol() coordinate with transcript aggregation logic to ensure consistent serialization for threshold signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Bytes Ownership] Does send_rpc_raw() take ownership of the Bytes parameter or clone it, and can this cause use-after-free if the bytes are modified concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Slice Mutation] Does sort_peers_by_latency() use safe Rust sorting, or could unsafe optimizations cause memory corruption in the peers slice? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Request-Response Binding] Does send_rpc() cryptographically bind responses to requests preventing response substitution attacks where validator A's response is claimed as validator B's? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent Epoch DKG] If DKG for epoch N+1 starts before epoch N completes, can send_rpc() calls for different epochs interfere with each other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Broadcast Consistency] When to_bytes_by_protocol() serializes for multiple peers, does it guarantee all peers receive byte-identical messages for reliable broadcast properties? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Partial Network Failure] If send_rpc() fails for f+1 validators (exceeding Byzantine threshold), does this cause total DKG failure, or can it continue with remaining validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency Metric Freshness] Does sort_peers_by_latency() use fresh latency measurements, or can stale metrics cause suboptimal peer ordering affecting DKG performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [Network Context Isolation] Does hardcoding NetworkId::Validator prevent DKG from being used in non-validator contexts (e.g., light clients), and is this a security feature or limitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw vs Typed Safety] What are the security implications of having both typed (send_rpc) and untyped (send_rpc_raw) APIs - can confusion between them cause type safety bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Error Recovery] If to_bytes_by_protocol() fails partway through serializing for multiple peers, is the error immediately returned or does it attempt to serialize remaining peers? (Medium)"
