  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: EventV2TranslationEngine::new()] [Missing Translator Attack] Can an attacker emit V2 events with types not registered in the translators HashMap, causing the system to silently drop critical events or panic, leading to incomplete indexing and potential fund tracking loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: EventV2TranslationEngine::new()] [Type Collision] Can two different event types hash to the same TypeTag in the translators HashMap, allowing one event type to be translated using the wrong translator and producing corrupted V1 events that misrepresent token transfers or coin operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: EventV2TranslationEngine::new()] [Initialization Race] If multiple threads call new() concurrently during node startup, can race conditions in the HashMap initialization cause some translators to be overwritten or missing, leading to event translation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: load_cache_from_db()] [Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate the EventSequenceNumberSchema table in the internal_indexer_db before load_cache_from_db() is called, poisoning the in-memory cache with incorrect sequence numbers that cause event replay or sequence number collisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: load_cache_from_db()] [Iterator Exhaustion DoS] If the EventSequenceNumberSchema table contains millions of entries, can the unbounded iteration in load_cache_from_db() cause memory exhaustion or startup delays that prevent node initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: load_cache_from_db()] [Transaction Ordering] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use race between loading the cache and processing new events, where events processed during cache loading could have incorrect sequence numbers due to stale cache data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: cache_sequence_number()] [Concurrent Write Race] Can concurrent calls to cache_sequence_number() for the same EventKey from different threads cause DashMap corruption or lost updates, resulting in duplicate sequence numbers being assigned to different events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: cache_sequence_number()] [Sequence Number Rollback] If a transaction fails after cache_sequence_number() is called but before DB commit, can the cached sequence number become desynchronized from the DB, causing gaps or duplicates in event sequences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_cached_sequence_number()] [Stale Cache Read] Can an attacker exploit the time window between cache updates and DB writes to observe stale sequence numbers, potentially front-running event processing or manipulating event ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_next_sequence_number()] [Integer Overflow] Can the sequence number increment (seq + 1) overflow when approaching u64::MAX, causing sequence numbers to wrap around to 0 and overwrite historical events with the same key and sequence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_next_sequence_number()] [Default Value Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the fallback to the 'default' parameter when both cache and DB are empty, providing a malicious default that causes sequence number conflicts with legitimate historical events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_next_sequence_number()] [Cache-DB Divergence] If the cache contains a higher sequence number than the DB due to uncommitted transactions, can get_next_sequence_number() return incorrect values that violate monotonic sequence number invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_resource()] [State View Timing] Does latest_state_checkpoint_view() return a consistent snapshot, or can concurrent state changes cause translators to read partially committed state, producing V1 events with inconsistent resource data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_resource()] [Panic on View Creation] Can the expect() call on latest_state_checkpoint_view() panic if the DB is in an inconsistent state, crashing the indexer thread and halting event translation indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_resource()] [StateKey Construction Error] Can malformed AccountAddress or StructTag inputs cause StateKey::resource() to return an error that propagates and crashes the translator, allowing attackers to DoS event indexing by emitting malformed events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_resource()] [Missing Resource Handling] When a resource is not found (None returned), do all callers properly handle this case, or can some translators proceed with null/default values causing incorrect event translation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource()] [ObjectGroup Missing Error] Can an attacker delete the ObjectGroup resource while events are being processed, causing the ok_or_else() to return an error that halts translation for all subsequent events in the batch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource()] [BCS Deserialization Vulnerability] Can maliciously crafted state_value bytes cause bcs::from_bytes<ObjectGroupResource> to panic or return corrupted data, allowing attackers to inject fake resources into the translation process? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource()] [Group Member Missing] When object_group_resource.group.get(struct_tag) returns None, does the caller handle this gracefully or can it cause unwrap() panics downstream that crash the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource()] [OBJECT_GROUP_TAG Lazy Init Race] Can concurrent access to the static Lazy<StructTag> OBJECT_GROUP_TAG during initialization cause race conditions or multiple initializations that violate the once-only semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: CoinDepositTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Coin Type Injection] Can an attacker emit CoinDeposit events with a malicious coin_type string that injects SQL-like syntax or path traversal into the struct_tag_str format string, corrupting the StructTag::from_str() parsing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: CoinDepositTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [DummyCoinType Type Confusion] Does using DummyCoinType for all CoinStoreResource deserialization hide type mismatches that could allow attackers to deserialize non-coin resources as CoinStore, extracting wrong event keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: CoinDepositTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Hardcoded Creation Number Collision] Can the hardcoded DEPOSIT_EVENT_CREATION_NUMBER (2) collide with user-created event streams at the same account, causing deposit events to be mixed with unrelated events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: CoinDepositTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Missing CoinStore Branch] When get_state_value_bytes_for_resource() returns None, does the else branch (using creation number 2, sequence 0) correctly handle accounts that legitimately have no CoinStore, or can this create phantom events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/event_v2_translator.rs] [Function: CoinDepositTranslator::translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Sequence Number Race] If get_next_sequence_number() is called after the CoinStore resource is fetched but before DB commit, can another transaction increment the real count, causing sequence number conflicts?
