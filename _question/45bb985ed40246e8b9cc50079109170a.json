  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: as_str()] [String representation injection] The function returns 'validator' or 'full_node' strings - if these are used in filesystem paths or commands, can attackers exploit this for path traversal or command injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: as_str()] [Log injection] If role strings are logged without sanitization, can specially crafted display values exploit log parsing systems or monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Case sensitivity] The from_str() implementation is case-sensitive - can attackers bypass role validation by using 'VALIDATOR' or 'Validator' (uppercase) to create unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Whitespace handling] Does from_str() handle leading/trailing whitespace, or can ' validator ' (with spaces) bypass validation and cause parsing failures at critical moments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Error information] ParseRoleError includes the invalid input string - if logged, can attackers inject malicious strings to exploit log parsing or create confusion during incident investigation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Limited variants] Only 'validator' and 'full_node' are accepted - are there undocumented role types in other parts of the codebase that should be supported here, potentially causing inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Trait: Display for RoleType] [Format string safety] The Display implementation uses write!(f, '{}', self.as_str()) - are there any scenarios where format string vulnerabilities could be introduced through this implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Trait: Debug for RoleType] [Information disclosure] The Debug implementation displays role type - if debug output is exposed through APIs or logs, can attackers use this to identify validators and plan targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Field addition attack] The deny_unknown_fields attribute prevents extra fields during deserialization - but can attackers exploit this to cause DoS by repeatedly sending configs with invalid fields, exhausting parser resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Serde: Default trait] [Partial deserialization] If deserialization fails partway through BaseConfig, does serde::default() create a partially-valid config that could bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Serde: Clone trait] [Deep cloning security] BaseConfig derives Clone - if configs containing SecureBackend are cloned, are cryptographic secrets or storage handles properly deep-copied or can they create shared state vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Serde: PartialEq] [Timing attacks] The PartialEq implementation compares all fields including waypoints - can timing attacks on equality comparisons leak waypoint values or path information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: PathBuf for data_dir] [Unicode normalization] Does PathBuf handle Unicode normalization consistently across platforms? Can attackers use equivalent Unicode representations to bypass path validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: PathBuf for data_dir] [Platform differences] PathBuf behavior differs on Windows vs Unix - can attackers exploit platform-specific path handling (e.g., UNC paths, drive letters) to access unintended locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: PathBuf for working_dir] [Null bytes] Can PathBuf fields contain null bytes or other special characters that could cause truncation or unexpected behavior in filesystem operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: PathBuf] [Absolute vs relative] Are data_dir and working_dir validated to be absolute paths? Can relative paths cause unexpected behavior when the process working directory changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: SecureBackend] [Backend type confusion] WaypointConfig::FromStorage takes SecureBackend - can attackers deserialize configs with unexpected backend types (file, vault, github) to exploit backend-specific vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: SecureBackend conversion] [Authentication bypass] When SecureBackend is converted to Storage (line 100), is authentication re-validated, or can pre-authenticated backends from untrusted sources bypass access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: SecureBackend] [Credential exposure] If SecureBackend contains credentials or tokens, are these properly redacted in Debug/Display output or can they leak through logs and error messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: SecureBackend] [Concurrent access] If multiple threads access the same SecureBackend storage simultaneously, can race conditions corrupt waypoint data or cause inconsistent reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: Waypoint] [Waypoint validation] When Waypoint is deserialized in FromConfig variant, is cryptographic validation performed to ensure it's a valid Aptos waypoint, or can arbitrary values be injected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Type: Waypoint] [Version compatibility] Can waypoints from incompatible blockchain versions or forks be deserialized successfully, causing nodes to follow wrong chains? (Critical)",
