  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: setup_staking()] [Missing validation] Does setup_staking() validate that initial_stake_amount meets minimum stake requirements before calling initialize_staking(), or could tests pass with insufficient stake amounts that would fail in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: setup_staking()] [State inconsistency] Can setup_staking() leave the validator in an inconsistent state if rotate_consensus_key() succeeds but join_validator_set() fails, potentially masking bugs in partial state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: setup_staking()] [Transaction ordering] Does setup_staking() enforce proper transaction ordering between initialize_staking(), rotate_consensus_key(), and join_validator_set(), or could race conditions in concurrent test execution cause state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: setup_staking()] [Error handling] Does setup_staking() properly propagate TransactionStatus errors from each step, or could it silently ignore initialization failures that would break subsequent validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: setup_staking()] [Address reuse] Can setup_staking() be called with address as both operator and voter when they should be distinct, potentially hiding bugs in multi-role validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Integer overflow] Does initialize_staking() validate that initial_stake_amount doesn't exceed u64::MAX or cause overflow when added to existing stakes, potentially masking stake manipulation vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Zero stake] Can initialize_staking() be called with initial_stake_amount=0, and if so, does this bypass minimum stake requirements that should be enforced in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Address validation] Does initialize_staking() validate that operator_address and voter_address are not zero addresses (0x0) before calling stake_initialize_stake_owner(), potentially hiding address validation bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Duplicate initialization] Can initialize_staking() be called multiple times for the same account, and if it succeeds in tests, does this mask bugs in the underlying staking contract's duplicate initialization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Self-delegation] Does initialize_staking() allow operator_address == voter_address == account.address(), and could this hide bugs in role separation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: initialize_staking()] [Balance check] Does initialize_staking() verify that account has sufficient balance to cover initial_stake_amount plus transaction gas, or could insufficient balance tests hide balance underflow bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: add_stake()] [Integer overflow] Can add_stake() be called with amount values that cause u64 overflow when added to existing stake pools, potentially masking critical arithmetic overflow vulnerabilities in stake accumulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: add_stake()] [Zero amount] Does add_stake() allow amount=0, and if so, does this bypass validation that should prevent no-op staking transactions that waste gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: add_stake()] [Maximum stake] Can add_stake() be called repeatedly to exceed maximum stake limits per validator, potentially hiding stake concentration vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: add_stake()] [Uninitialized pool] Does add_stake() validate that a stake pool exists for the account, or could calling it on uninitialized accounts mask missing initialization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: add_stake()] [Balance validation] Does add_stake() check that account balance >= amount before attempting to stake, or could tests with unlimited test coins hide real balance underflow bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: unlock_stake()] [Partial unlock] Can unlock_stake() be called with amount greater than active stake, and does the test properly validate the error condition or silently allow partial unlocking? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Function: unlock_stake()] [Active validator] Can unlock_stake() be called while validator is in active set, and should this be blocked to prevent validator set instability? (High)",
