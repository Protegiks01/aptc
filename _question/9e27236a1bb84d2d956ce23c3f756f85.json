(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Struct: Error, Field: message] [Information Disclosure] Does the String message field have unbounded length, allowing attackers to craft error responses that leak sensitive internal state, file paths, or validator information through verbose error messages?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: new()] [Type Conversion] Does the StatusCode::as_u16() conversion in new() handle all possible StatusCode values safely, or can invalid status codes cause undefined behavior when later converted back via from_u16()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker pass arbitrarily large message strings to new(), causing memory exhaustion or DoS by accumulating massive error objects in the system without any length validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: new()] [Null Byte Injection] Can an attacker inject null bytes in the message parameter to new(), causing string truncation vulnerabilities when error messages are logged or displayed, potentially hiding malicious activity?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: from_anyhow_error()] [Format String] Can anyhow::Error objects containing format string specifiers be converted unsafely via to_string(), potentially causing format string vulnerabilities if the error message is later used in formatting operations? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: bad_request()] [Message Injection] Can an attacker control the Display parameter msg in bad_request() to inject malicious content into error responses, such as CRLF characters for HTTP response splitting or XSS payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: bad_request()] [Unicode Exploitation] Does the msg.to_string() call in bad_request() properly handle malicious Unicode characters like zero-width spaces, right-to-left overrides, or homoglyphs that could confuse logging systems or hide attack indicators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: bad_request()] [Error Message Enumeration] Can attackers enumerate valid vs invalid inputs by analyzing detailed error messages from bad_request(), potentially revealing information about valid account addresses, transaction formats, or API parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: not_found()] [Ledger Version Oracle] Does the not_found() function expose the exact ledger_version parameter, allowing attackers to perform oracle attacks to determine when specific resources appear or disappear from the blockchain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: not_found()] [Resource Enumeration] Can the formatted error message in not_found() leak information about valid resource types and identifier formats, enabling attackers to enumerate existing accounts, modules, or resources on the blockchain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: not_found()] [Parameter Injection] Can an attacker control the resource or identifier parameters in not_found() to inject malicious content into the formatted error string, potentially causing log injection or breaking error parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: not_found()] [Timing Side Channel] Does returning not_found() errors with ledger_version information create timing side channels where attackers can infer blockchain state by measuring response times for different version numbers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: invalid_param()] [Parameter Name Disclosure] Does invalid_param() expose internal parameter names that could reveal API implementation details, database schema, or internal variable names useful for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: invalid_param()] [Value Reflection Attack] Can attackers inject malicious values via the value parameter in invalid_param() that get reflected in error responses, enabling XSS or injection attacks when error messages are rendered in web interfaces?
