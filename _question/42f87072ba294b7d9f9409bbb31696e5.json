(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [Post-validation Mutation] After validate_module_natives() returns Ok(()), are the validated modules used directly for deployment, or could they be swapped/modified before actual storage, bypassing validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [Concurrent Validation] If multiple transactions attempt to deploy modules concurrently, does each call to validate_module_natives() on line 12 operate on isolated state, or could race conditions allow one transaction's validation to affect another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [CompiledModule Parsing] Line 13 assumes modules contains valid CompiledModule instances - if parsing/deserialization has bugs, could malformed modules bypass validation by causing is_native() or self_addr() to return incorrect values?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [Resource Safety Violation] Since natives can manipulate resources directly, if validate_module_natives() has a bypass, could an attacker violate Move's resource safety guarantees to double-spend or mint unlimited tokens? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [Short-circuit Evaluation] If multiple modules contain invalid natives, does the early return on line 17 prevent detection of all violations, allowing an attacker to probe which modules failed by observing error messages? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/verifier/native_validation.rs] [Function: validate_module_natives()] [Address Hash Collision] If module_address.is_special() on line 16 uses hash-based comparison, could an attacker find a collision where a non-special address hashes to the same value as 0x0-0xf, bypassing validation?
