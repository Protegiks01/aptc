  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::new()] [Information disclosure] Can an attacker trigger verbose error messages through malformed requests that expose internal system state, file paths, or stack traces leading to information leakage about Aptos node configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::from_anyhow_error()] [Information disclosure] Does the conversion from anyhow::Error to API Error sanitize sensitive information, or can internal error details (database paths, memory addresses, validator keys) leak through to external clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::internal()] [Information disclosure] Can attackers deliberately trigger internal server errors to extract sensitive debugging information about the node's internal state, consensus status, or validator configuration through error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::status_code()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft an Error with an invalid u16 code value that causes unwrap_or fallback behavior, potentially masking the true nature of security-critical errors by always returning 500 status codes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::not_found()] [Ledger version manipulation] Can an attacker provide an arbitrary ledger_version parameter to not_found() that doesn't match the actual ledger state, causing clients to make incorrect assumptions about blockchain state and potentially leading to double-spend attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::aptos_ledger_version()] [Type confusion] Can the conversion from u64 to U64 wrapper type in aptos_ledger_version() cause integer overflow or truncation issues when handling extremely large ledger version numbers near u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::invalid_param()] [Format string injection] Can an attacker inject format string specifiers in the 'name' or 'value' parameters that could potentially exploit Display trait implementations to cause panics or information disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: Error::invalid_request_body()] [Log injection] Can attackers inject newline characters or ANSI escape codes in error messages that pollute logs, making it harder to detect real attacks or causing log parsing tools to misinterpret security events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Struct: Error serialization] [State inconsistency] Can the optional aptos_ledger_version field being skipped during serialization cause clients to receive error responses without ledger context, leading to incorrect retry logic or stale state assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Panic propagation] Can panic-inducing errors from underlying systems propagate through the From trait implementation causing node crashes or service disruption when processing malicious API requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response::new()] [Serialization failure] Can an attacker provide input that causes serde_json::to_vec() to fail or panic after state has been committed, leading to inconsistent responses where ledger_info headers don't match the actual returned data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: Response::new_bcs()] [Panic on serialization] Does bcs::to_bytes() using unwrap() create a panic vector where maliciously crafted data structures can crash the API server, causing denial of service for API consumers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Header injection] Can an attacker manipulate LedgerInfo fields (chain_id, ledger_version, epoch, etc.) to inject malicious HTTP headers that could exploit downstream proxies or client-side parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Integer truncation] Can chain_id being cast from a larger type to u16 cause truncation of legitimate chain ID values, potentially allowing cross-chain replay attacks if clients rely on this header for validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Type conversion] Can the conversion of U64 types to HeaderValue using .into() cause unexpected behavior or panics for extremely large version numbers, disrupting API availability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [State inconsistency] Can ledger_version and ledger_timestamp headers be out of sync with the actual response body content, causing clients to process data from one ledger version while believing it's from another, enabling front-running attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Epoch confusion] Can the epoch header being inconsistent with the ledger version cause clients to incorrectly cache validator sets, potentially accepting invalid signatures during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Block height manipulation] Can oldest_block_height being greater than block_height due to race conditions cause clients to make invalid assumptions about data availability and prune their local state incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Struct: Response] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker request responses that generate extremely large body Vec<u8> allocations causing out-of-memory conditions and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Function: into_response()] [Content-Type confusion] Can the is_bcs_response flag being incorrectly set cause clients to parse BCS data as JSON or vice versa, potentially leading to type confusion vulnerabilities in client applications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Information disclosure] Can the HttpRequestLog capturing full request paths with query parameters expose sensitive data like private keys, authentication tokens, or account addresses in logs that might be transmitted to external monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Log injection] Can attackers inject malicious content in referer or user_agent headers that corrupt log files with ANSI escape codes, newlines, or control characters to hide attack patterns or inject false log entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Sampling bypass] Can attackers deliberately trigger 500 errors at a rate slightly below the 1-second sample rate to evade detection while conducting sustained attacks against the API? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Privacy violation] Does logging remote_addr expose client IP addresses in violation of privacy regulations, and can this information be used to correlate validator operators with their node IP addresses for targeted attacks?
