  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Enum: CommitNotification] [Single Variant] Why does CommitNotification enum have only one variant CommittedStateSnapshot - is this future-proofing or can it be simplified? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: poll_next() implementations] [Poll Correctness] Do all poll_next implementations correctly register wakers and handle Poll::Pending to avoid lost wakeups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: is_terminated() implementations] [Termination Race] Can stream termination checks race with final message delivery, causing the last notification to be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [General] [Channel Backpressure] Do unbounded channels lack backpressure mechanisms that could prevent sender overload detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Async Cancellation] Can the async function be cancelled between storage notification and mempool notification, creating inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: notify_mempool_of_committed_transactions()] [Await Point] Can the await point at line 530-531 be exploited to introduce delays in mempool notifications affecting transaction ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: notify_storage_service_of_committed_transactions()] [Async Timeout] Does the async notify_new_commit at line 566-567 have timeout protection to prevent indefinite blocking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: initialize_sync_target_request()] [Version Gap] Can a large gap between sync_target_version and latest_committed_version cause resource exhaustion during catch-up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_satisfied_sync_request()] [Version Jump] Does detecting latest_synced_version > sync_target_version at line 347 indicate a double-commit bug or legitimate parallel sync paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [General] [Version Wraparound] What happens if version numbers approach u64::MAX - are there protections against version wraparound? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationHandler] [Time Service Trust] Is time_service at line 221 from a trusted source, or can it be manipulated to affect sync duration satisfaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: sync_request_satisfied()] [Time Monotonicity] Does time_service guarantee monotonic time, or can backwards time jumps cause sync requests to never be satisfied? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: initialize_sync_duration_request()] [Time Capture] Is start_time captured at line 252 atomic with request creation, or can time drift between capture and use? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Zero Version] What happens if latest_synced_version is 0 (genesis) - are all notification handlers prepared for this edge case? (Medium)",
