  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Canonical encoding] Does serialize() produce a canonical encoding for Vec<Vec<u8>>, or can multiple different serializations represent the same data enabling signature malleability or state commitment divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [UTF-8 validation bypass] If Vec<Vec<u8>> is later interpreted as UTF-8 strings in Move code, can deserialize() allow invalid UTF-8 sequences through, causing panics or security issues in string processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Timing side channel] Does serialization time vary based on Vec<Vec<u8>> contents in ways that leak sensitive information about transaction arguments through timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Speculative execution] Can branch prediction or speculative execution during deserialization leak information about Vec<Vec<u8>> contents through side channels? (Low)"
