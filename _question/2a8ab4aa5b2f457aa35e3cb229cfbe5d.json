  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Integration: BufferManager] [Epoch boundaries] During epoch transitions, can ExecutionWaitPhase return execution results for blocks from the old epoch, causing BufferManager to commit them with incorrect epoch_state validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Integration: BufferManager] [Timestamp reconciliation] Does ExecutionWaitPhase's response preserve reconfiguration timestamp information, or can timestamp mismatches after execution cause commit_info validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Channel: execution_wait_phase_tx] [Channel flooding] Can a Byzantine component flood execution_wait_phase_tx with ExecutionWaitRequest objects faster than they can be processed, causing unbounded channel growth and memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Channel: execution_wait_phase_rx] [Response ordering] Does the unbounded channel guarantee FIFO ordering of ExecutionResponse messages, or could reordering cause BufferManager to process responses out of sequence? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Channel: Reset behavior] When reset_flag is set during process(), does ExecutionWaitPhase properly cancel in-flight futures, or can stale execution results be returned after reset? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Async: Future polling] Can the BoxFuture in ExecutionWaitRequest be polled multiple times or from multiple threads, causing undefined behavior or non-deterministic execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Async: Panic safety] If the execution future panics during await, does process() catch the panic or will it crash the entire pipeline phase task? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Async: Cancellation safety] If the PipelinePhase task is cancelled while process() is awaiting the future, can this leave partial execution state in the executor causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Async: Tokio runtime] Can ExecutionWaitPhase's process() method block the tokio runtime thread pool, preventing other critical consensus tasks from making progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Async: Future wake] If the execution future's waker is never called (buggy future), will process() detect this deadlock or hang forever? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Error: ExecutorError::BlockNotFound] When process() returns BlockNotFound error, can this be exploited to skip block execution by a Byzantine validator who provides futures that intentionally fail with this error? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Error: ExecutorError::EmptyBlocks] If ExecutionSchedulePhase creates ExecutionWaitRequest with empty block list, does the error returned by process() get properly handled or cause consensus to stall? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Error: ExecutorError::InternalError] Can generic InternalError from execution hide critical issues like state corruption, allowing consensus to continue with invalid state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Error: ExecutorError::BadNumTxnsToCommit] If execution returns BadNumTxnsToCommit, does this cause permanent divergence between validators or can they recover? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Error: ExecutorError::CouldNotGetData] If process() returns CouldNotGetData timeout error, does the block get re-executed or is it permanently dropped, causing liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [State: Ordered to Executed] Does ExecutionWaitPhase guarantee atomic transition from Ordered to Executed state in BufferManager, or can partial transitions cause state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [State: Execution root] If multiple ExecutionResponse objects arrive concurrently, can race conditions in updating execution_root cause BufferManager to skip blocks or process them twice? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [State: Aggregated fast path] Can ExecutionWaitPhase return execution results that bypass the Executed state and jump directly to Aggregated, violating state machine invariants? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [State: Buffer consistency] If ExecutionWaitPhase returns results for a block that's already been reset from the buffer, can this cause use-after-free or invalid memory access? (Critical)",
