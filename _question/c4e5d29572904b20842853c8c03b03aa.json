  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Input: Unicode names] Are Unicode characters in key names properly handled, or can they cause encoding issues in KVStorage backend? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Input: Name length limits] Are there length limits on key names, or can extremely long names cause buffer overflows in storage backend? (Medium)",
