  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: DbDir] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), can different case variations of db_dir cause multiple database instances to conflict, corrupting data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: DbDir] [Long Path Names] Can excessively long db_dir paths exceed OS limits (260 chars on Windows), causing database open failures that leave the debugger in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: ShardingConfig] [Shard Count Mismatch] Does enable_storage_sharding=true always assume 16 shards, or can database instances with different shard counts cause queries to fail or return wrong data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: ShardingConfig] [Migration Attack] Can an attacker exploit the sharding config during database migration from non-sharded to sharded layout, causing data to be lost or placed in wrong shards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Struct: ShardingConfig] [Feature Flag Bypass] Can enable_storage_sharding be used to bypass AIP-97 enforcement that requires sharding on mainnet, allowing validators to run with legacy non-sharded databases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All open_*_db() Functions] [Shard Distribution] Can imbalanced shard distribution caused by incorrect sharding_config cause some shards to grow much larger than others, degrading query performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: open_state_kv_db()] [Metadata Corruption] Can concurrent access to leger_db.metadata_db_arc() from multiple StateKvDb instances cause metadata corruption when write operations occur? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Lock Contention] Can multiple debugger processes opening the same database with readonly=true cause lock contention that prevents the main validator from writing new transactions? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: open_state_kv_db()] [Error Shadowing] If open_ledger_db() returns an error, does it get properly propagated or can StateKvDb::new() succeed with invalid metadata_db_arc causing silent corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Panic Recovery] Do any database open operations use panic instead of Result for error handling, causing the entire debugger process to crash rather than gracefully failing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [Error Context Loss] Does the map operation in parse_nibble_path() preserve error context showing which character failed to parse, or is critical debugging information lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Resource Cleanup] If database opening fails after allocating resources (env, block_cache), are these resources properly cleaned up or leaked? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [All Functions] [Unsafe Code] Are there any hidden unsafe blocks in the called functions (StateMerkleDb::new, StateKvDb::new, LedgerDb::new) that could cause memory safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/common/mod.rs] [Function: parse_nibble_path()] [String Allocation] Can parsing extremely long nibble path strings cause heap fragmentation or allocation failures that crash the debugger? (Medium)",
