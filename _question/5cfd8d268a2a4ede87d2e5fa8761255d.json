  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the version increment logic (on_chain_version() + 1) by manipulating on_chain state to cause integer overflow, wrapping version numbers back to 0? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Signature Forgery] Is the consensus_key.sign(&observed) call properly protected against side-channel attacks or timing attacks that could leak the private key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [State Inconsistency] When comparing state.observed with state.on_chain.jwks(), can an attacker craft JWKMoveStruct values that are semantically identical but have different binary representations, causing unnecessary consensus rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call process_new_observation concurrently for the same issuer, can race conditions in states_by_issuer.entry() cause lost updates or incorrect state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Abort Handle Leak] If start_produce() succeeds but the function returns an error later, is the abort_handle properly cleaned up to prevent background consensus processes from continuing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Channel Overflow] Can the qc_update_tx channel (buffer size 1) drop quorum-certified updates if process_new_observation is called rapidly for different issuers, causing consensus completion to be missed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [State Machine Violation] Can process_new_observation be called when consensus_state is already InProgress or Finished, and if so, does it properly abort the old session before starting a new one? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [JWK Validation] Are the jwks parameter values validated for correctness (e.g., valid key types, sizes, exponents) before signing, or can malformed JWKs be signed and propagated to peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Epoch Mismatch] Does the function validate that self.epoch_state matches the current epoch before starting consensus, or can stale observations be signed with old epoch keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Author Verification] Is self.my_addr properly authenticated as a valid validator in the current epoch before signing observations, or can unauthorized nodes participate in JWK consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Clone Overhead] Does cloning issuer, jwks, and observed multiple times cause performance issues that could be exploited for DoS by triggering excessive allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [State Rollback] Can a malicious actor trigger reset_with_on_chain_state with an old AllProvidersJWKs snapshot to rollback local consensus progress, causing validators to re-propose already committed updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [Consensus Abort] When states_by_issuer.retain() removes issuers, are their in-progress consensus sessions (with abort_handle_wrapper) properly aborted, or do they continue consuming resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [Race Condition] If reset_with_on_chain_state is called while process_new_observation is executing for an issuer being removed, can this cause use-after-free or dangling reference issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [State Desync] Can the comparison locally_cached == Some(&on_chain_provider_jwks) fail to detect actual changes due to non-deterministic serialization of ProviderJWKs, causing missed updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [HashSet Collision] Can an attacker craft issuer names with hash collisions to cause incorrect issuer retention/deletion during the difference operation? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [Issuer Injection] Does the function validate that issuer names in on_chain_state are properly formatted and don't contain special characters that could exploit string handling bugs elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [State Atomicity] If the function panics or returns an error after partially updating states_by_issuer, can this leave the manager in an inconsistent state with some issuers updated and others stale? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [Duplicate Issuers] Can on_chain_state.entries contain duplicate issuers, and if so, which one takes precedence - could this be exploited to override legitimate JWKs? (High)",
