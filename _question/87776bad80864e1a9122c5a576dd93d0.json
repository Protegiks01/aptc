  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Event ordering guarantees] When multiple peer events happen rapidly, does broadcast() guarantee delivery order across all subscribers, or can out-of-order events cause state inconsistencies in applications? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: subscribe()] [Initial state race] Between reading initial peer state and subscribing, can new connections/disconnections occur that aren't captured, leaving subscribers with incomplete peer views? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: subscribe()] [Backlog overflow] If there are more than NOTIFICATION_BACKLOG (1000) connected peers during subscribe(), initial NewPeer events are silently dropped, can this cause applications to miss critical validator connections? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_trusted_peers()] [Trusted peer set race] Can updates to the trusted peer set via set_trusted_peers() race with reads from get_trusted_peers(), causing inconsistent trusted peer views across concurrent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: set_trusted_peers()] [Unauthorized trust updates] Is there access control on set_trusted_peers() to prevent malicious code from arbitrarily modifying the trusted peer set and adding compromised validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_trusted_peer_state()] [Trust state spoofing] Can an attacker exploit gaps in trusted peer validation to make untrusted peers appear as trusted, bypassing security checks for validator-only operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency NaN exploitation] While the code expects latency is never NaN, can malicious peers inject NaN values through peer_monitoring_metadata causing panics in the comparison function? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Sort stability] Does sort_unstable_by guarantee consistent ordering for peers with equal latency, or can unstable sorting cause non-deterministic peer selection affecting consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Struct: PeersAndMetadata] [HashMap contention] Can heavy concurrent read/write operations on peers_and_metadata RwLock cause lock contention leading to message delivery delays and consensus timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Struct: PeersAndMetadata] [Memory exhaustion] Is there a limit on the number of peer entries that can be stored, or can an attacker register unlimited peers causing unbounded memory growth and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Constant: NOTIFICATION_BACKLOG] [Backlog sizing] Is NOTIFICATION_BACKLOG=1000 sufficient for networks with >1000 validators, or can burst connection events overflow the channel causing missed notifications during epoch changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Enum: ConnectionState] [Disconnected state unused] The comment says ConnectionState::Disconnected is 'Currently unused', can this cause peers to remain in Disconnecting state indefinitely, preventing proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: is_connected()] [State check bypass] Does is_connected() only check ConnectionState::Connected, or can peers in Disconnecting state still receive messages creating a window for race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: supports_protocol()] [Protocol set tampering] Can connection_metadata.application_protocols be modified after initial handshake, allowing attackers to claim support for protocols they don't actually implement? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: supports_any_protocol()] [Empty protocol set] What happens if a peer has an empty application_protocols set - will supports_any_protocol() incorrectly allow messages to be sent despite no protocol support? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Struct: PeerMetadata] [Monitoring metadata trust] Is peer_monitoring_metadata validated before use, or can malicious peers report fake health metrics to manipulate routing decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: new()] [Default connection state] PeerMetadata::new() defaults to ConnectionState::Connected, can this be exploited by inserting metadata before the connection is fully established, allowing premature message delivery? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Error handling] If get_sender_for_network_id() fails, is the error properly propagated, or can silent failures cause messages to be lost without notification to the application? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Atomicity violation] When send_to_peers() sends to multiple networks/protocols, if one network_sender fails, are prior sends rolled back, or can partial delivery cause inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc_raw()] [Response type mismatch] Does send_to_peer_rpc_raw() validate that the response Message type matches the expected type, or can type confusion lead to deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Trait: NetworkClientInterface] [Unimplemented methods] The add_peers_to_discovery() method is unimplemented with unimplemented!() macro - can calling this from production code cause validator panics? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Protocol union logic] Does get_available_peers() correctly handle peers that support both direct_send and rpc protocols, or can protocol set overlap cause peers to be counted multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization order] If network_ids contains duplicates, does the initialization loop in new() handle this correctly, or can duplicate entries cause inconsistent initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_all_peers()] [Inclusion of disconnected peers] The comment warns get_all_peers() returns disconnected peers - can applications that ignore this warning send critical data to offline peers causing security issues? (Medium)",
