  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: fake_socket] [Memory socket wrapping] ReadWriteTestSocket wraps MemorySocket - does this in-memory transport properly simulate network delays, packet loss, and reordering that attackers could exploit in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: fake_socket] [Write recording] The save_writing() functionality stores written bytes - could this memory accumulation cause test OOM conditions that hide DoS vulnerabilities in production message handling? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Connection metadata] The connect() function creates ConnectionMetadata with ConnectionOrigin::Outbound - does this properly test authorization logic that might differ for inbound vs outbound connections in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Disconnect handling] The disconnect() function only updates ConnectionState to Disconnected - does this properly test cleanup of resources and state that production must perform to prevent resource leaks from malicious disconnect/reconnect attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Network type matching] The find_common_network() logic determines which networks can communicate - does this properly test network isolation violations where attackers might bridge Validator and Public networks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Protocol negotiation] The conn_metadata() function uses default_protocols() or provided protocol_ids - does this properly test protocol downgrade attacks where byzantine nodes negotiate to weaker protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Message ordering] The send_next_network_msg() sends messages with hardcoded values (request_id: 0, priority: 0, receive_timestamp_micros: 0) - does this hide production bugs related to message ordering, priority handling, or timestamp validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [RPC channel handling] The drop_next_network_msg() forcefully drops res_tx oneshot channels - does this properly test timeout and cancellation scenarios where attackers might intentionally not respond to RPCs? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Peer role validation] Mock connection helpers create connections with specific PeerRoles - does this properly test role-based access control where attackers might misrepresent their validator status? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_framework] [Node construction] The build_node trait method allows application-specific node creation - does this ensure consistent security initialization across different test scenarios, or could missing security setup in tests hide production vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_framework] [Node ownership] The take_node() method removes nodes from the framework - does this properly test scenarios where nodes leave the network, ensuring production code handles validator departures and prevents use-after-free of network resources? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Test-production boundary] Are there any code paths where test utilities from this module could accidentally be called by production code, potentially bypassing security checks designed only for test environments? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Configuration mismatch] Do test-generated NodeConfigs (in builder.rs) match production configuration schemas exactly, or could schema differences hide bugs where attackers craft configs that pass tests but exploit production validators? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Async executor] The test code uses block_on for async operations - does this properly test async cancellation and timeout scenarios that production code must handle to prevent resource exhaustion from slow or unresponsive peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Channel capacity] Test channels might have different capacities than production - does this hide back-pressure and queue overflow vulnerabilities where attackers flood validators with messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Peer ID collision] The random PeerId generation in tests uses potentially weak randomness - does this properly test production logic that must handle actual peer ID collisions or byzantine nodes that deliberately generate conflicting IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Network context mocking] NetworkContext::mock_with_peer_id might skip validation that production performs - does this create blind spots where security bugs pass tests but fail in production when Byzantine nodes provide malicious contexts? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: mod.rs] [Deterministic testing] The hardcoded RNG seed ensures deterministic tests - but does this hide non-deterministic bugs in production like race conditions in peer discovery or consensus message handling that only appear under adversarial timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Function: create_client_server_network_context()] [None handling] When both client_public_key and server_public_key are None, random peer IDs are used - does this properly test production behavior when validators join with newly generated keys? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Function: create_context_for_public_key()] [Match exhaustion] The match on public_key only handles Some and None - but does this ensure all production code paths for key handling (including invalid keys) are properly tested? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: builder] [Phantom type] The _framework_marker: PhantomData ensures type safety - but does this prevent tests from accidentally mixing incompatible node types that could hide type confusion vulnerabilities in production? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: fake_socket] [EOF handling] ReadOnlyTestSocket returns Ok(0) for EOF - does this properly test production code's handling of unexpected connection closures that Byzantine nodes might use to disrupt consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/testutils/mod.rs] [Module: test_node] [Panic on missing network] The peer_network_id() method panics if the network doesn't exist - could this hide production bugs where nodes attempt to communicate on non-configured networks, potentially bypassing access controls? (Medium)"
