  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/lib.rs] [Module visibility] Does exposing all storage submodules (backup, schema, state_restore, etc.) as public modules create an unnecessarily broad API surface that could be exploited by malicious code importing this crate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/lib.rs] [Re-export security] The re-export 'pub use crate::db::AptosDB;' makes the core database struct publicly accessible - could this allow external crates to instantiate AptosDB instances in unsafe ways, bypassing initialization checks in the actual implementation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/lib.rs] [Unsafe code prohibition] The '#![forbid(unsafe_code)]' directive prevents unsafe Rust in this crate - but does this guarantee extend to all submodules, or could submodules like db, state_store, or ledger_db contain unsafe blocks that bypass this protection? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/lib.rs] [API exposure] By making 'backup', 'schema', 'state_restore', and 'utils' public modules, does this inadvertently expose internal database schemas or restore mechanisms that could be abused to corrupt state or bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/lib.rs] [Module dependencies] The module declaration structure doesn't show explicit dependencies between modules - could circular dependencies or improper module initialization order lead to race conditions during AptosDB startup? (Low)"
