  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Ord, PartialOrd for EventKey] [Ordering ambiguity] Does the derived ordering compare creation_number before account_address consistently, or can ordering inconsistencies cause event streams to be processed in different orders across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq for EventKey] [Equality bypass] Can floating point precision issues or field padding cause two EventKeys that should be equal to be treated as different, breaking event deduplication logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy for EventKey] [Deep copy issues] Does the Copy trait guarantee independent copies, or can shared references between copied EventKeys cause mutation issues if underlying data structures change? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize for EventKey] [Version compatibility] Is there versioning in the serialization format to handle EventKey structure changes across protocol upgrades, or can old serialized data cause deserialization failures and consensus splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize for EventKey] [Integer encoding vulnerabilities] Does BCS encoding protect against varint compression attacks where malformed integers cause deserialization to read far more bytes than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize for EventKey] [Recursive deserialization] Can nested or recursive EventKey structures be created through deserialization to cause stack overflows during parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::new()] [Count initialization] Can EventHandle be created with inconsistent count values that don't match the actual number of events in the stream, causing event replay or gaps in event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::new()] [Key reuse] Is there validation preventing the same EventKey from being used in multiple EventHandles, which could cause event stream conflicts and data corruption in storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::new()] [Count overflow initialization] Can an attacker initialize EventHandle with count close to u64::MAX to cause immediate overflow on the next event emission, potentially crashing the VM or causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::new()] [Uninitialized handles] Can EventHandles be created without proper initialization in Move code, leading to handles with default/zero values that conflict with actual event streams? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::key()] [Reference lifetime] Does returning a reference to EventKey create lifetime issues where the reference outlives the EventHandle, potentially causing use-after-free bugs in Rust code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::key()] [Immutability bypass] Can the returned reference be unsafely cast to mutable, allowing modification of the EventKey after EventHandle creation and breaking immutability guarantees? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count()] [Count rollback] If a transaction aborts after reading count(), can the count value be rolled back incorrectly leading to duplicate event sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count()] [Off-by-one] Does count represent events emitted or the next sequence number, and can confusion about this semantic lead to off-by-one errors in event stream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count_mut()] [Race condition] Can multiple threads or transactions concurrently access count_mut() to modify the counter without proper synchronization, causing event sequence numbers to be reused or skipped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count_mut()] [Unchecked increment] When incrementing the count through the mutable reference, is there overflow checking, or can count wrap from u64::MAX to 0 causing duplicate event sequence numbers and replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count_mut()] [Transaction atomicity] If a transaction increments count via count_mut() but then aborts, is the increment properly rolled back, or can failed transactions leave the counter in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/event.rs] [Function: EventHandle::count_mut()] [Unauthorized mutation] Can Move code from untrusted modules gain mutable access to EventHandle counters they don't own, allowing them to manipulate event sequences of other accounts? (Critical)",
