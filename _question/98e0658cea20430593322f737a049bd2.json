  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Display] [Stack Traces] When errors are logged or transmitted over the network, can stack traces or debug information expose internal validator architecture, library versions, or code paths useful for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Propagation] [Remote Exploitation] If configuration errors are returned through RPC APIs or P2P network protocols, can remote attackers trigger specific errors to probe for vulnerabilities or gather system information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: BCS] [Genesis Tampering] Can attackers craft malicious genesis files with invalid BCS encoding that trigger BCS errors during node initialization, causing nodes to fail to start and preventing network bootstrapping? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: BCS] [Cryptographic Key Corruption] When BCS deserialization of validator keys or cryptographic material fails, are the partially deserialized bytes securely wiped from memory, or can they be extracted through memory dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Yaml] [Parser Exploits] Does the YAML error handling protect against YAML parser vulnerabilities (billion laughs, recursive references) that could cause DoS during configuration loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Variant: Yaml] [Type Confusion] Can YAML type confusion (parsing numbers as strings, booleans as integers) bypass sanitization checks and cause validators to operate with incorrect security-critical parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Insecure Defaults] When configuration loading fails with IO, BCS, or Yaml errors, do fallback code paths use insecure default values instead of failing safely, potentially allowing validators to start in degraded security modes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Partial Config Load] Can errors during configuration loading cause partial configuration states where some security settings are applied but others are not, creating inconsistent security postures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Config Rollback] When sanitization fails, are there rollback mechanisms to prevent corrupted or partially-applied configurations from persisting, or can nodes remain in insecure states across restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Cross-Module] [Consensus-Storage Mismatch] Can mismatched error handling between consensus config and storage config sanitizers cause validators to start with incompatible consensus and storage settings, leading to data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Cross-Module] [Network-Consensus Gap] If network configuration errors are handled differently than consensus configuration errors, can this create scenarios where nodes have valid network configs but invalid consensus configs, participating in P2P but not consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Cross-Module] [API-Execution Inconsistency] Can errors in API configuration sanitization allow REST APIs to start while execution config has errors, enabling external parties to submit transactions that will fail deterministically creating DoS conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Concurrency] [TOCTOU Config Changes] During the window between config sanitization returning Ok and the node actually starting, can configuration files be modified on disk, bypassing the sanitization that already passed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Error State Races] When multiple threads are loading different configuration components, can concurrent errors leave the system in an inconsistent state where some configs are loaded but others have failed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Signal Handling] If the node receives termination signals during configuration loading and error handling, can this cause corrupted configuration files to be written or security-critical initialization to be skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Validator Attack] [Config Injection] Can a compromised operator inject malicious configurations that produce specific error patterns designed to bypass sanitization checks through error handling gaps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Validator Attack] [Error-Based Fingerprinting] Can attackers probe validator nodes with malformed configuration-related requests to trigger specific errors that reveal validator software versions, config structures, or security settings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Validator Attack] [Log Injection] Can crafted configuration values that trigger errors be used to inject false log entries that could mislead security monitoring or incident response teams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Mainnet] [Production Safeguards] Are all ConfigSanitizerFailed errors for mainnet-incompatible configurations (failpoints, in-memory storage, test mode) guaranteed to be fatal and prevent node startup? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Mainnet] [Chain ID Validation] When InvariantViolation errors occur during chain ID extraction from genesis, can this allow validators to accidentally participate in testnet consensus while configured for mainnet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Mainnet] [Upgrade Safety] During protocol upgrades, can error handling changes in configuration loading introduce backward-incompatible behavior that causes validator divergence or network splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Logging] [Log Flooding] Can attackers trigger rapid configuration errors that flood logs, hiding evidence of actual attacks or causing log aggregation systems to drop critical security events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Logging] [Monitoring Evasion] Are configuration errors properly categorized with severity levels, or can critical security errors be logged as warnings that don't trigger alerting systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Logging] [Audit Trail] When configuration errors occur, is sufficient context logged (user, timestamp, attempted values) to support security audits and forensic analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Context] [Attack Attribution] Do errors preserve sufficient context to trace configuration problems back to their source (which config file, which field, which value), or is this information lost during error propagation? (Low)"
