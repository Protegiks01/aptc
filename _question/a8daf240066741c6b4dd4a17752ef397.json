  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [Compilation Determinism] Does the module organization ensure deterministic compilation across different environments, or could differences in module loading order lead to non-deterministic bytecode that breaks consensus among Aptos validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Public API] [Version Compatibility] Are there proper versioning guarantees for the exported public API, or could breaking changes in FullyCompiledProgram or Compiler structs cause existing Move code to be recompiled with different semantics, breaking deployed contracts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: parser] [AST Corruption] Could the parser module's AST structures be corrupted through malicious input, leading to incorrect expansion or verification that allows unsafe operations in the final bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: expansion] [Type Confusion] Does the expansion module properly maintain type information during macro expansion, or could generic instantiation create type confusion that violates Move's resource safety model? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: verification] [Incomplete Verification] Are all Move safety properties (resource uniqueness, reference safety, global storage invariants) completely verified by the verification module, or could some properties be left unchecked? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Module] [State Consistency] Do the modules (parser, expansion, verification, ir_translation) properly maintain consistent state when passed between compilation stages, or could state corruption lead to bytecode that violates Move invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Export Chain] [Privilege Escalation] Could the public exports create an attack chain where an attacker uses Compiler → SteppedCompiler → bypass verification → generate malicious bytecode that steals funds from Aptos accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: ir_translation] [Optimization Bugs] Could optimization passes in ir_translation introduce subtle bugs that change program semantics, such as reordering operations that should be atomic or eliminating necessary safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: compiled_unit] [Module Loading] Does the compiled_unit module validate that loaded modules have correct signatures and access controls, preventing attackers from deploying modules that impersonate system accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Compiler Pipeline] [Gas Metering] Is gas metering validation performed during compilation, or could malicious Move code be compiled that executes infinite loops or consumes excessive resources without proper gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Information Leakage] Could diagnostic messages leak sensitive information about the compilation environment, deployed module internals, or private keys that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: unit_test] [Test Isolation] Are unit tests properly isolated from production compilation, or could test code paths be activated in production builds leading to undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Public Exports] [API Misuse] Could the combination of exported functions (generate_interface_files + output_compiled_units) be misused to overwrite legitimate compiled modules with malicious versions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: interface_generator] [Signature Forgery] Can interface files be generated with forged function signatures that allow calls to privileged functions with incorrect types, bypassing access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Legacy Compiler] [Compatibility Issues] As a legacy compiler, are there known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in move-compiler-v2 but remain in this version, and could attackers exploit the legacy version if it's still used? (High)"
