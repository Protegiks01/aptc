  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Error code bypass] At line 30-32, can an attacker manipulate the process to set an error_code other than WebFrameworkError, potentially bypassing rate limiting or error monitoring that keys on specific error codes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Hardcoded error code] Is the hardcoded AptosTapErrorCode::WebFrameworkError at line 32 appropriate for all framework errors, or can critical security errors (auth failures, rate limiting) be masked with this generic code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Configuration bypass] Since build_error_response() creates AptosTapError which respects USE_HELPFUL_ERRORS flag, can an attacker manipulate this flag or exploit race conditions during flag changes to force detailed error messages to be shown when they should be hidden? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Information disclosure timing] If USE_HELPFUL_ERRORS flag changes between line 17 (error detection) and line 21 (error response building), can an attacker observe timing differences to infer sensitive system state or bypass security controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Fund exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly trigger framework errors that consume faucet funds or resources before convert_error() properly handles them, leading to faucet account drainage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Rate limit bypass] Can framework errors be triggered in a way that bypasses rate limiting checks, allowing an attacker to exhaust the faucet by making unlimited requests that fail but still consume resources before error conversion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Transaction manipulation] If framework errors occur during transaction submission to fund accounts, can convert_error() inadvertently mark failed transactions as successful or vice versa, leading to double-funding or missed funding? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Audit log bypass] Does convert_error() log all errors appropriately before conversion, or can attackers trigger framework errors that bypass security monitoring and audit logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Metrics manipulation] Can the error conversion at lines 18-26 be exploited to report incorrect error metrics or monitoring data, masking attack attempts or system issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [Silent failure] If build_error_response() fails internally, is the failure logged and monitored, or can silent failures allow errors to go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Panic safety] Can error.has_source() at line 17 or error.to_string() at line 21 panic on certain malformed error types, causing the faucet service to crash? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Lifetime issues] Does the async lifetime of convert_error() properly handle error object lifetimes, or can use-after-free or dangling reference issues occur if the error is accessed after being consumed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [OpenAPI spec violation] The comment at line 8-12 states every response should be JSON AptosTapError format - can framework errors with different content-types or formats bypass this contract and break client parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Response format inconsistency] Can the response returned at line 23 have a different structure than the response at line 25, violating the API contract and causing client-side errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_error_response()] [JSON serialization] Can the AptosTapErrorResponse created at line 30-33 fail to serialize to JSON for certain error_string values (e.g., invalid UTF-8, control characters), leading to 500 errors on top of original errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Error chain manipulation] If the error parameter has a long chain of source errors, can the has_source() check at line 17 traverse the entire chain safely, or can circular error chains cause infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Error context loss] Does converting framework errors to generic WebFrameworkError at line 32 lose critical error context needed for debugging security incidents or investigating attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Framework version vulnerability] Does the error.has_source() check at line 17 work correctly across all poem framework versions, or can version-specific bugs in poem error handling bypass the conversion logic? (Medium)",
