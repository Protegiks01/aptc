  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Concurrency] [Metrics Counter] If multiple threads concurrently update compression metrics for the same client label, are atomic operations used to prevent counter corruption or underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Concurrency] [Client Switching] Can concurrent operations with different CompressionClient values lead to non-deterministic compression behavior that violates consensus determinism requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Serialization] [Binary Format] If CompressionClient is serialized for RPC or storage, could an attacker craft malicious serialized data to create invalid enum variants outside the defined 6 variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Serialization] [Version Compatibility] If new client variants are added in future versions, could deserialization of old data cause panics or undefined behavior in the match statement within get_label()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Serialization] [Endianness] If CompressionClient is transmitted over network in binary form, are there endianness issues that could cause client misidentification between nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Metrics] [Compression Ratio] Can an attacker manipulate compression ratios for specific client types to trigger false alarms in monitoring systems and cause operational disruptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Metrics] [Traffic Analysis] Do compression metrics per client type leak information about network topology, validator behavior, or transaction patterns that could be exploited by attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Metrics] [Label Cardinality] Could an attacker cause metric explosion by rapidly creating and destroying compression sessions with different client types, overwhelming monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Metrics] [Alerting Bypass] If compression anomaly detection relies on per-client metrics, could an attacker distribute malicious traffic evenly across all 6 client types to stay under detection thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Consensus] [Proposal Compression] Can malicious validators use CompressionClient::Consensus to compress invalid proposals that bypass size limits when decompressed, potentially causing consensus crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Consensus] [Vote Amplification] Could compression of consensus votes be exploited to amplify vote messages beyond protocol limits, potentially causing Byzantine validators to appear to control more voting power? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Consensus] [Compression Bombs] Can attackers submit consensus messages that are small when compressed but decompress to gigabytes, exhausting validator memory and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Consensus] [Timeout Manipulation] Could compression overhead for consensus messages be exploited to cause timeout violations in AptosBFT, triggering unnecessary view changes and degrading performance? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [Mempool] [Fee Bypass] If transaction size fees are calculated before compression, could attackers use compression to submit oversized transactions that bypass fee requirements? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [StateSync] [Bandwidth Exhaustion] Could attackers request excessive state sync operations with CompressionClient::StateSync to exhaust network bandwidth and prevent validators from synchronizing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-compression/src/client.rs] [StateSync] [Version Skew] Can compression format differences between state sync clients cause new validators to receive incompatible state data and fail to join the network? (High)",
