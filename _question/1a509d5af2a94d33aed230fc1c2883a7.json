  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/file_store_operator_v2/local.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on invalid input] Can an attacker cause a panic-based denial of service by passing a non-existent path to LocalFileStore::new(), which unconditionally panics at line 22 instead of returning a Result, potentially crashing the indexer service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/file_store_operator_v2/local.rs] [Function: new()] [Unwrap panic] Does the .unwrap() call on path.to_str() at line 18 panic when given a path containing invalid UTF-8 sequences, allowing an attacker to crash the indexer by providing malformed path bytes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/file_store_operator_v2/local.rs] [Function: new()] [TOCTOU race condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between the path.exists() check at line 21 and actual file operations, where an attacker could delete the directory after validation but before use, causing subsequent operations to fail?
