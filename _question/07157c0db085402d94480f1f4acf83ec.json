  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: ROCKSDB_PROPERTIES] [Metric Name Collision] The metric names are generated by replacing dots with underscores (line 69) - could this cause name collisions if different RocksDB properties map to the same Prometheus metric name, causing one property to overwrite another? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: ROCKSDB_PROPERTIES] [Label Cardinality] The ROCKSDB_PROPERTIES metric uses cf_name and property_name labels (line 77) - with many CFs and properties, could this create excessive label cardinality that degrades Prometheus query performance or causes metric drops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: ROCKSDB_SHARD_PROPERTIES] [Triple Label Cardinality] ROCKSDB_SHARD_PROPERTIES adds a shard dimension (lines 91-96) creating 3-dimensional metrics - with 16 shards × multiple CFs × 31 properties, could this create thousands of time series causing metrics system overload? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: OTHER_TIMERS_SECONDS] [Timer Overhead] The timer on line 108 measures update_rocksdb_properties() duration - if this timer itself has bugs or the timing code introduces overhead, could this skew performance measurements or affect the 10-second collection interval? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Property: rocksdb.background-errors] [Error Counter] The background-errors property (line 38) accumulates errors - if this counter overflows or wraps around after many errors, could it reset to zero causing operators to miss ongoing database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Property: rocksdb.is-write-stopped] [Boolean Property] Properties like is-write-stopped (line 63) are likely boolean - if RocksDB returns non-standard values (e.g., -1 vs 0/1), could the i64 conversion misinterpret the state, causing alerts to miss write stalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Property: rocksdb.oldest-snapshot-time] [Timestamp Property] The oldest-snapshot-time property (line 50) is likely a Unix timestamp - converting this to i64 and exposing as a gauge could cause confusion or incorrect alerting if monitoring systems expect a duration instead of an absolute time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Property: rocksdb.actual-delayed-write-rate] [Rate Property] The actual-delayed-write-rate (line 62) represents a rate - if RocksDB returns this in unexpected units or if the property changes meaning across RocksDB versions, could this cause misinterpretation of write throttling severity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Constant: TIMEOUT_MS] [Test/Prod Divergence] The cfg!(test) conditional (line 187) sets different timeouts for test vs production - if test-specific code paths or race conditions only manifest with the 10ms timeout, could production validators have bugs that tests don't catch? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Test Thread Lifecycle] With TIMEOUT_MS=10ms in tests, the thread loop iterates 1000× faster - could this cause test-specific thread lifecycle issues, races in thread shutdown, or resource exhaustion in test environments that don't occur in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: set_property()] [Empty Result] If db.get_property() returns Ok(0) for all properties (e.g., on a freshly initialized or corrupted database), would this appear normal in metrics, hiding the fact that the database is not functioning correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: set_shard_property()] [Duplicate Metrics] If set_shard_property() is called with the same cf_name, db, and shard multiple times, could this cause metric values to be set repeatedly with the same or conflicting values, creating metric timestamp confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Recursive Error] If update_rocksdb_properties() calls metric collection which itself tries to read database properties, could this create recursive calls or circular dependencies that cause stack overflow or deadlock? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Database Lock Contention] If update_rocksdb_properties() acquires database locks when calling get_property(), could this cause lock contention with transaction processing threads, degrading consensus performance during metric collection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Component Startup Order] If RocksdbPropertyReporter is created before databases are fully initialized, could early metric collection attempts fail repeatedly, flooding logs and wasting resources during validator startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Shutdown Race] If databases begin shutdown while update_rocksdb_properties() is running, could this cause access to partially-closed databases, resulting in undefined behavior or panics that prevent clean shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Multiple Instances] If multiple RocksdbPropertyReporter instances are created for the same databases (which should not happen but isn't prevented), could they interfere with each other's metric collection, causing duplicate or conflicting metric updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Struct: RocksdbPropertyReporter] [Send/Sync Safety] The RocksdbPropertyReporter contains a Mutex and JoinHandle - if this struct is accidentally shared across thread boundaries unsafely, could this cause data races or thread safety violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: drop()] [Drop Order] If the sender is dropped before join_handle.join() completes (due to early return or panic), could the receiving thread block indefinitely on recv_timeout(), preventing proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Persistent Errors] If update_rocksdb_properties() fails repeatedly due to persistent database issues, the warn! logs continue indefinitely (lines 181-184) - is there any escalation mechanism or circuit breaker to alert operators to sustained metric collection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Partial Success Handling] If some set_property() calls succeed but others fail within update_rocksdb_properties(), does the function continue or abort early, and could this lead to incomplete metric updates that hide failures in specific column families? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: set_property()] [Property Availability] Are all properties in ROCKSDB_PROPERTY_MAP guaranteed to exist in all RocksDB versions used by Aptos, or could version mismatches cause get_property() to return errors for missing properties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Static: ROCKSDB_PROPERTY_MAP] [Memory Overhead] The ROCKSDB_PROPERTY_MAP stores 31 property name strings (lines 35-67) - while small, in memory-constrained environments, could this static allocation combined with thousands of metric time series cause memory pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Thread Stack Size] The spawned thread (line 179) uses default stack size - if update_rocksdb_properties() has deep call stacks or large local variables, could stack overflow cause thread panics that go undetected until the next collection interval? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: new()] [Self-Monitoring Gap] If the RocksdbPropertyReporter thread crashes or hangs, there's no monitoring of the monitoring system itself - could operators be unaware that metric collection has stopped, operating with stale data during critical incidents? (Medium)"
