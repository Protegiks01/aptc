  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: BatchRequesterState::new()] [Integer overflow] Can retry_limit be set to usize::MAX causing integer overflow when incremented in num_retries comparisons, potentially allowing unlimited retry attempts and resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: BatchRequesterState::new()] [State corruption] If signers Arc<Mutex<BTreeSet<PeerId>>> is shared across multiple BatchRequesterState instances, can concurrent modifications lead to inconsistent peer selection across different batch requests? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: BatchRequesterState::new()] [Validation bypass] Can retry_limit be initialized to 0, causing next_request_peers() to immediately return None and preventing any batch requests from being sent, leading to consensus liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Race condition] When checking num_retries == 0 before acquiring the signers.lock(), can a race condition occur if multiple threads call this simultaneously, causing duplicate random index generation and biased peer selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Mutex deadlock] If the signers.lock() call blocks indefinitely due to another thread holding the lock, can this cause the entire batch request flow to hang and prevent consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Modulo by zero] If signers.len() returns 0 (empty validator set), can the modulo operation at line 45 cause a panic and crash the consensus node? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Weak randomness] Does rand::thread_rng() provide sufficient entropy for peer selection, or can an attacker predict the next_index values to selectively target or avoid specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Integer overflow] When calculating (self.next_index + num_peers) % signers.len() at line 59, can integer overflow occur if next_index is near usize::MAX, causing incorrect peer selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Retry exhaustion] Can a malicious responder deliberately fail to respond to exhaust all retry_limit attempts, forcing the requester to give up and causing batch unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Peer duplication] When num_peers > signers.len(), does the .cycle().skip().take() chain properly handle wraparound, or can it return duplicate peer IDs causing redundant network requests? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Counter manipulation] Are the counters::SENT_BATCH_REQUEST_COUNT and SENT_BATCH_REQUEST_RETRY_COUNT properly synchronized, or can concurrent increments lose counts affecting monitoring and metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Starvation attack] If num_retries reaches retry_limit and returns None while futures are still pending, can the request_batch() function get stuck waiting for responses that will never arrive? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [Validator set manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator modify the shared signers BTreeSet during iteration, causing inconsistent peer selection or skipped validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: next_request_peers()] [State inconsistency] If next_index is updated without checking signers.len() after acquiring the lock, can validator set changes mid-request cause out-of-bounds access? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch confusion] Can epoch be set to a value that doesn't match the current consensus epoch, causing batch requests to be rejected and preventing transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: new()] [Identity spoofing] Can my_peer_id be set to a different validator's PeerId, allowing one validator to impersonate another in batch requests? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration attack] Can request_num_peers be set to 0, causing no batch requests to be sent and leading to consensus liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: new()] [DoS via configuration] Can request_num_peers be set to an extremely large value (e.g., u32::MAX), causing excessive network traffic and resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/batch_requester.rs] [Function: new()] [Retry bypass] Can retry_limit be set to 1, allowing a single malicious validator to deny batch availability by refusing to respond? (High)",
