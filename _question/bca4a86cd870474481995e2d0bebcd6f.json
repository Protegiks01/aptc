(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Function: native_sub()] [History Recording Exploit] After calling record() at line 214, can an attacker manipulate the history to show a smaller negative delta than actually occurred, bypassing validation during materialization? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Function: native_sub()] [NegativeDelta Addition] At lines 202-210 when subtracting from NegativeDelta (which requires addition), can overflow of the negative delta value cause wrapping that enables bypassing the max_value limit?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Function: native_destroy()] [State Inconsistency] At line 133, remove_aggregator() is called - but if the aggregator has pending PositiveDelta or NegativeDelta changes, does destroy properly commit or rollback these changes, or can it leave storage in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Function: native_destroy()] [Gas Undercharging] Is AGGREGATOR_DESTROY_BASE at line 121 sufficient given that destroy must update both aggregators map and destroyed_aggregators set, or can attackers spam cheap destroy operations?
