  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Lines: 84-85] [Stats logging overhead] If periodic_function_stats_sec is set to a very low value, can excessive logging of view function and simulation stats cause disk I/O saturation and slow down validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Lines: 84-85] [Stats disable impact] If periodic_function_stats_sec is None, does the lack of monitoring make it harder to detect abuse or DoS attacks on view functions and simulation endpoints? (Low)",
