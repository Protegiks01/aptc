  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Impact Analysis] [Key Extraction Timeline] If timing side-channels exist, how many signature observations would an attacker need to extract a validator private key, and is this feasible given Aptos block production rates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Economic Impact] [Validator Stake Loss] If timing attacks allow key extraction and validator impersonation, what is the maximum economic damage (slashing, double-signing penalties, stolen delegated stake)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Network Impact] [Chain Halt] Could widespread timing-based key extraction of multiple validators simultaneously cause a loss of liveness requiring emergency network intervention? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Governance Impact] [Protocol Upgrade] If cryptographic vulnerabilities are discovered, does Aptos governance have emergency procedures to rotate all validator keys and upgrade crypto implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Long-term Security] [Future Threats] As quantum computing advances and new cryptanalytic techniques emerge, is there a plan to regularly reassess constant-time properties against evolving threat models? (Medium)"
