  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Input validation] Does the RawStateValueRequest.key field have any length limits or validation, or can an attacker submit arbitrarily large hex-encoded keys causing memory exhaustion when deserializing to StateKey? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Hex encoding] Can malformed hex strings (e.g., odd-length, invalid characters) in the key field bypass validation and cause panics or undefined behavior during HexEncodedBytes parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft an extremely large hex-encoded key that causes integer overflow in size calculations when converted to HexEncodedBytes.0 Vec<u8>? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Denial of service] Is there a maximum size check on the key field before deserialization, or can attackers submit multi-gigabyte hex strings causing API server OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Canonicalization] Does the hex encoding accept both uppercase and lowercase, and can an attacker exploit case-sensitivity differences to bypass caching or access control checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [BCS deserialization] When request.key.0 is deserialized using bcs::from_bytes to StateKey, can an attacker craft malicious BCS payloads that trigger panics or memory corruption in the BCS parser? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Type confusion] Can the BCS-encoded key be crafted to deserialize into an unexpected StateKey variant (AccessPath/TableItem/Raw), bypassing intended access controls for specific state types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Nested deserialization] Since StateKey variants contain nested structures (AccessPath with Path enum, TableItem with handle+key), can deeply nested BCS structures cause stack overflow during recursive deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [BCS bomb] Can an attacker craft a small hex-encoded key that expands exponentially during BCS deserialization (decompression bomb), causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Version skew] If the StateKey enum is modified in future versions, can old API clients submit keys that deserialize incorrectly, causing state corruption or unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [StateKey::Raw variant] Can an attacker use the StateKey::Raw variant to access arbitrary raw bytes in state storage, bypassing Move type safety and accessing internal blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [StateKey::AccessPath] Can the key field encode an AccessPath to protected system addresses (0x1, 0x2, etc.) to read privileged resources like validator configs or treasury balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [StateKey::TableItem] Can an attacker construct arbitrary TableHandle values in the key to enumerate and extract all table items across the blockchain, leaking private data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Resource access] Does the key validation check if the requested StateKey corresponds to a user-accessible resource, or can it read internal VM state, pending write sets, or Merkle tree nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Module bytecode] Can the key be crafted to access raw module bytecode at arbitrary addresses, potentially revealing unreleased or private contract code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Authorization bypass] Does RawStateValueRequest have any access control checks before deserialization, or can unauthenticated users query arbitrary state values including private account data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Rate limiting] Are there rate limits on raw state value requests per IP/API key, or can an attacker enumerate the entire state store by issuing millions of requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [CORS policy] If this experimental endpoint lacks proper CORS restrictions, can malicious websites submit cross-origin requests to extract user state data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [API key exposure] If API authentication is required, does error handling avoid leaking whether a StateKey exists when authorization fails, preventing information disclosure? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Timing side-channel] Does the response time vary based on whether a StateKey exists in storage, allowing an attacker to probe for account existence via timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Error message leak] Do error messages differentiate between 'key not found', 'access denied', and 'invalid format', allowing attackers to map the state store structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Metadata exposure] Can the raw state value response include internal metadata like timestamps, version numbers, or cache status that leaks operational information? (Low)",
