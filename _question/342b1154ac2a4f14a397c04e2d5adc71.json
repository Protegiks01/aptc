  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Struct: UserTransaction, Line 22] [Insertable Macro] Does the Insertable derive correctly exclude inserted_at field from INSERT statements, or will explicit insertion attempts fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Struct: UserTransaction, Line 28] [Version Uniqueness] Is the UNIQUE constraint on version enforced before attempting insertion, or can concurrent inserts cause constraint violation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Struct: UserTransaction, Lines 31-32] [Sequence Uniqueness] Can the UNIQUE(sender, sequence_number) constraint be violated if standardize_address() produces different outputs for the same sender? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Line 95] [Cross-Table Race] Can signatures be inserted before the UserTransaction record, causing foreign key violations if processed out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Struct: UserTransaction, Line 24] [Foreign Key Timing] Does the foreign key constraint to transactions(version) allow for delayed insertion of the parent record, or must it be strictly ordered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Line 67] [Version Extraction] Is version extracted once and reused consistently throughout, or are there multiple extractions that could diverge? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: get_signatures(), Line 103] [Version Parameter] Is the version parameter passed to get_signatures() always identical to the version in the returned UserTransaction struct? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Lines 62-97] [Retry Safety] If from_transaction() is called multiple times for the same transaction (due to retry logic), can this cause duplicate attempts to insert the same version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Lines 62-97] [Idempotency] Is from_transaction() idempotent, or can multiple invocations with the same input produce different outputs due to internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Lines 67, 79] [Bounds Validation] Are version and sequence_number validated to be within i64::MIN to i64::MAX range before casting, or can wrapping occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Lines 64, 65] [Parameter Bounds] Are block_height and epoch parameters validated by the caller to be within valid ranges, or are arbitrary values accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Lines 62-97] [Panic Safety] Does from_transaction() guarantee panic-free execution for all possible APIUserTransaction inputs, or can edge cases cause unwrap panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: get_signatures(), Lines 100-118] [Panic Safety] Can get_signatures() panic on any valid APIUserTransaction input, or is it guaranteed to return Ok or empty vector? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/user_transactions.rs] [Function: from_transaction(), Line 66] [Tuple Destructuring] If callers incorrectly destructure the (UserTransaction, Vec<Signature>) tuple, can this cause signatures to be lost or misassigned? (Medium)",
