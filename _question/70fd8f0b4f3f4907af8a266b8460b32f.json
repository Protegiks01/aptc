  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Edge Case] What happens if source_ip is 0.0.0.0, localhost, or other special IP addresses - are these properly handled or can they bypass IP-based checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Concurrency] Can multiple threads calling check() on the same checker instance cause data races in checker implementations that don't properly use synchronization primitives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Concurrency] If a checker implementation uses interior mutability (RefCell) instead of Mutex, can this violate the Send + Sync bounds and cause undefined behavior in multi-threaded contexts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Concurrency] Does the JoinSet used in spawn_periodic_tasks() properly handle cancellation of all tasks during shutdown, or can tasks continue running after the checker is dropped, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Concurrency] Can periodic tasks spawned by spawn_periodic_tasks() race with check() and complete() methods, causing inconsistent state in shared data structures like rate limit counters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Configuration] Does the system validate that at least one rate limiting checker is configured, or can administrators accidentally deploy with no rate limits, allowing unlimited token drainage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Configuration] Can multiple checker configurations reference the same Redis database or storage backend with conflicting settings, causing rate limit corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Configuration] Does the system prevent loading obviously insecure configurations like max_requests_per_day=u32::MAX or empty auth token lists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Configuration] Can the CaptchaManager passed to build() be None or in an invalid state, causing TapCaptchaChecker initialization to succeed but fail at runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Memory Safety] Does the Arc<HeaderMap> in CheckerData prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities, or can dropping the original HeaderMap while checkers hold Arc references cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Memory Safety] Can the Clone trait on CheckerData and CompleteData cause excessive memory usage if these structs are cloned repeatedly for each checker in a long chain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Type Safety] Does the enum_dispatch macro generate safe code that prevents type confusion between different Checker variants? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Dry Run] Can the dry_run flag in check() be exploited to perform reconnaissance on rate limit state without triggering updates, allowing attackers to perfectly time their attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Dry Run] Does the system ensure that dry_run is never passed to complete(), or can calling complete() with data from a dry_run request cause inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Dry Run] Can attackers use the is_eligible endpoint (which sets dry_run=true) to discover valid auth tokens, captcha solutions, or other secrets through timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Fund Drainage] If all checkers return Ok(vec![]) (no rejections), does the system automatically proceed to funding, or is there a final validation step that attackers must bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Fund Drainage] Can attackers exploit checker logic to cause all checkers to return empty rejection vectors through carefully crafted requests that hit edge cases? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Fund Drainage] Does the system enforce a maximum funding amount per request, or can attackers modify the receiver address or other parameters after passing checks to drain more funds than intended? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Fund Drainage] Can attackers bypass checkers entirely by calling the funding endpoint directly without going through the checker pipeline? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [State Consistency] If the system crashes between check() succeeding and complete() being called, do rate limit counters remain incremented forever, causing permanent DoS for affected IPs/users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [State Consistency] Can checkers have inconsistent state across multiple instances (e.g., in load-balanced deployments), allowing attackers to bypass rate limits by distributing requests across different instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [State Consistency] Does the system handle partial failures where some checkers succeed in check() but others fail, and can this leave checkers in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [DoS] Can attackers send requests that cause expensive checker operations (Redis queries, captcha generation) without ever completing funding, exhausting system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [DoS] Does the system have timeout limits on check() and complete() operations, or can slow checkers block all request processing indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [DoS] Can attackers trigger excessive logging or monitoring by crafting requests that produce large rejection reason messages, filling up disk space? (Low)"
