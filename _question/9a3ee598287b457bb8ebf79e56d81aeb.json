  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Struct: AccountData] [Integer overflow] Can the sequence_number field (U64 type) overflow when converted from AccountResource, potentially allowing sequence number wraparound attacks that bypass replay protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Struct: AccountData] [Type confusion] Does the U64 wrapper for sequence_number properly validate maximum values during deserialization, or can an attacker provide malformed JSON to cause integer overflow when consumed by transaction validation logic? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Function: from()] [Memory safety] Can the authentication_key().to_vec() conversion at line 22 trigger a panic or memory corruption if AccountResource contains malformed authentication key data from corrupted state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Function: from()] [Type conversion] Is the sequence_number().into() conversion at line 24 safe against type confusion attacks where AccountResource contains u64::MAX values that could wrap around? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Function: from()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger excessive memory allocation by providing AccountResource with extremely large authentication_key data, causing DoS when converting to AccountData? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Enum: AssetType] [Validation bypass] Does AssetType properly validate that Coin and FungibleAsset variants represent valid, existing asset types, or can fake asset types be created through API manipulation? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Parsing ambiguity] At lines 40-48, can the sequential parsing logic (try Address first, then MoveStructTag) be exploited with strings that are valid in both formats, creating asset confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/account.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Error handling] Does from_str() properly sanitize error messages at line 45, or can attacker-controlled input strings trigger verbose errors that leak sensitive blockchain state information? (Low)",
