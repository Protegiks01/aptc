  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Absolute Subdir Check] Line 393-395 checks if subdir is absolute - but does PathBuf::from_str properly handle all absolute path formats across different platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Normalized Path Check] The ParentDir component check on line 397-399 only checks the first component of normalized_subdir - is this sufficient to prevent all path traversal attempts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [CanonicalGitIdentity Validation] Line 404 creates CanonicalGitIdentity from user-provided URL - does this validate the URL format, scheme, and domain to prevent injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Aptos Node URL Parsing] For PackageLocation::Aptos, the node_url is parsed on line 417 - can malformed URLs cause panic, or does it gracefully handle malicious input? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [CanonicalNodeIdentity Validation] Line 422 creates CanonicalNodeIdentity - does this ensure the node URL is actually an Aptos node and not a malicious endpoint serving backdoored packages? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Package Address Validation] For on-chain packages, is package_addr validated to be a legitimate Aptos address format, or can attackers provide malformed addresses that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Recursive Resolution] The function recursively calls resolve_package at the end (line 431-440) - can this create call stack exhaustion with deeply nested dependency trees? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Lock File Manipulation] Throughout the file, package_lock is passed as mutable reference - can an attacker race against lock file updates to inject malicious dependency resolutions that persist across builds? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Lock File Authority] Does the package lock file have any integrity protection (signatures, checksums) to prevent tampering, or can an attacker modify it to redirect dependencies to malicious sources? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Network Version Caching] When resolve_network_version is called (line 193), is the result cached in a way that could be poisoned by an attacker to cause incorrect network version usage? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Git Revision Caching] When resolve_git_revision is called (line 388-390), can an attacker manipulate the resolution to lock a malicious commit ID that gets cached for future builds? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Cache Directory Traversal] Does the package_cache properly sanitize package names and identities before using them as filesystem paths, or can directory traversal in cached package names compromise the cache? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Cache Poisoning via Git] Can an attacker gain control of a git repository temporarily, have their malicious code cached, then revert the repo, leaving the poisoned cache to be served to other users? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Cache Sharing] Is the package cache shared between different users or projects, allowing an attacker to poison the cache for one project and affect others? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Concurrent Cache Access] Can concurrent package resolution operations lead to race conditions in cache read/write, resulting in corrupted or incomplete package data being cached? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Manifest Parsing] The function calls move_package_manifest::parse_package_manifest multiple times - are there injection vulnerabilities in the TOML parser that could be exploited via malicious Move.toml files? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Manifest Size Limits] Are there size limits on Move.toml files, or can an attacker provide an extremely large manifest that causes memory exhaustion during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Dependency Count Limits] Are there limits on the number of dependencies a package can declare, or can an attacker create a manifest with thousands of dependencies causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Manifest Field Injection] Can an attacker inject unexpected fields or values in Move.toml that bypass validation but get processed in unsafe ways by downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Graph Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft dependency manifests that create a graph with millions of nodes or edges, exhausting memory and causing denial-of-service? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [NodeIndex Overflow] Are there checks to prevent NodeIndex overflow if an attacker adds enough packages to the graph to exceed the maximum NodeIndex value? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Graph Mutation Safety] After the graph is constructed, are there protections to prevent unintended mutations that could corrupt the dependency structure? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Edge Weight Manipulation] The Dependency struct used as edge weight appears empty - could future additions to this struct introduce vulnerabilities if edge weights are not properly validated? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Error Path Disclosure] Error messages throughout the file include filesystem paths (e.g., line 252-256) - do these leak sensitive information about the build environment to potential attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Panic on Error] Are all error conditions handled gracefully with Result returns, or are there code paths that could panic and crash the resolution process? (Medium)"
