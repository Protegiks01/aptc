  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: get_transaction_expiration_time()] [Unimplemented panic] The function has unimplemented!() for Absolute expiration mode - can an attacker trigger this panic by manipulating the transaction_expiration field, causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_user_account()] [Address collision] The function derives address from AuthenticationKey::ed25519(public_key).account_address() - can an attacker generate multiple public keys that hash to the same account address, potentially stealing funds or impersonating accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: implicitly_create_user_account_and_transfer()] [Front-running attack] This function creates an account and transfers in one transaction - can an attacker front-run the account creation to claim the derived address first, potentially stealing the transfer amount? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_user_account()] [Public key validation] Does AuthenticationKey::ed25519() validate that public_key is a valid Ed25519 point? Can an attacker provide invalid public keys that lead to unspendable accounts or address derivation issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_account()] [Signature threshold bypass] Can an attacker set signatures_required to 0 or greater than the number of owners, creating multisig accounts that are either uncontrolled (no signatures needed) or permanently locked (impossible to reach threshold)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_account()] [Owner validation] Does the function validate that additional_owners doesn't contain duplicates or the sender's address? Can an attacker create multisig accounts where the same address counts multiple times toward the signature threshold? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_account_with_existing_account()] [Account takeover] Can an attacker use this function to convert their existing account to a multisig account with malicious owners, potentially locking out the original owner or enabling unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_account_with_existing_account_and_revoke_auth_key()] [Irrevocable conversion] This function revokes the authentication key - can an attacker use this to permanently lock an account by setting an impossible signature threshold, causing permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_transaction()] [Payload validation] The function accepts arbitrary payload bytes - can an attacker inject malicious bytecode or exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in the payload processing, potentially executing unauthorized operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: approve_multisig_transaction()] [Transaction ID manipulation] Can an attacker approve non-existent transaction_ids or transaction_ids belonging to different multisig accounts, potentially executing unauthorized transactions or causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: reject_multisig_transaction()] [Rejection race condition] Can an attacker front-run legitimate approvals with rejections, preventing valid multisig transactions from executing and causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_transaction_with_payload_hash()] [Hash collision] The function uses HashValue::sha3_256_of() for payload hashing - while SHA3-256 is collision-resistant, can an attacker exploit any weaknesses in hash computation to create different payloads with identical hashes, enabling payload substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: create_multisig_transaction_with_payload_hash()] [Payload validation bypass] By only storing the hash instead of the full payload, can an attacker later provide a different payload that matches the hash (via collision or preimage attack), executing unauthorized operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker call transfer() with amount set to u64::MAX, potentially causing integer overflow in balance calculations or fee computations, leading to fund loss or economic exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: account_transfer()] [Function confusion] Both transfer() and account_transfer() exist with similar purposes but different underlying implementations (aptos_coin_transfer vs aptos_account_transfer) - can an attacker exploit differences in validation or behavior between these functions to bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: implicitly_create_user_account_and_transfer()] [Reentrancy risk] Does the implicit account creation followed by transfer create any reentrancy opportunities where the account creation callback could be exploited before the transfer completes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Zero amount transfer] Can an attacker create zero-amount transfers to spam the network or exploit edge cases in transfer accounting, potentially causing state bloat or DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: mint()] [Unauthorized minting] The mint() function allows minting APT to any address - what prevents unauthorized callers from using this to inflate the token supply and cause catastrophic economic damage? Is there proper access control at the Move contract level? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: mint()] [Amount overflow] Can an attacker call mint() with amount set to u64::MAX multiple times to overflow the total supply counter, potentially breaking token accounting and causing economic collapse? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: mint()] [Address validation] Can an attacker mint tokens to invalid or burned addresses (0x0), permanently removing tokens from circulation or exploiting burn address interactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: script()] [Arbitrary bytecode execution] The script() function accepts arbitrary Script payloads - can an attacker inject malicious Move bytecode that bypasses transaction validation or exploits VM vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: script()] [Gas estimation] Does script execution have proper gas metering? Can an attacker craft infinite-loop scripts or computationally expensive operations that consume excessive resources despite gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: add_dispatchable_authentication_function()] [Function registration attack] Can an attacker register malicious authentication functions through add_dispatchable_authentication_function() that always return true, effectively bypassing authentication for their account? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: add_dispatchable_authentication_function()] [Module validation] Does the function validate that function_info references a legitimate authentication module? Can an attacker point to malicious contracts or non-existent functions to exploit error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: add_dispatchable_authentication_function()] [Function info manipulation] The function_info contains module_address, module_name, and function_name as separate fields - can an attacker manipulate these to call unintended functions or bypass module access controls? (High)"
