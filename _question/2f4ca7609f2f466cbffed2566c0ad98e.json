  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [Config: CodeUnit] [Code structure validation] Are CodeUnit.code vectors validated for basic structure before control flow checking, or can malformed code units cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [Loop validation: check_continues()] [Multiple entry points] Can loops with multiple entry points (jumps from different locations to different loop body positions) bypass the single loop head validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [Loop validation: check_breaks()] [Multiple exit points] Are loops with multiple break points (different instructions branching to different offsets after the loop) properly validated, or can this create control flow confusion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [Loop validation: instruction_labels()] [Loop without exits] Can an attacker create infinite loops with no break instructions that pass validation but hang validators during execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [Loop validation: count_loop_depth()] [Loop depth calculation precision] For deeply nested loops approaching max_depth, is the count accurate enough to prevent off-by-one errors that allow exceeding the limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [State: loop_stack in check_code()] [Stack overflow] Can an attacker craft bytecode with nested loops deep enough to cause loop_stack to overflow even before reaching max_loop_depth check? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/control_flow_v5.rs] [State: loop_stack management] [Stack underflow] If loop_stack.pop() is called without corresponding push (due to validation bugs), can this cause underflow and incorrect validation of subsequent loops? (High)",
