  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: insert()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call insert() with unique StructTag keys to cause unbounded memory growth in the BTreeMap, leading to validator node out-of-memory crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: insert()] [State Corruption] Does insert() return the old value when replacing an existing key, and can an attacker exploit this to overwrite critical object data without proper validation, causing state inconsistencies across the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft malicious StructTag keys with identical serialized representations but different semantic meanings to create hash collisions in the BTreeMap, causing data corruption or unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization Attack] Does the BCS serialization in to_bytes() properly handle edge cases like empty BTreeMaps, extremely large maps, or maps with malformed StructTag keys that could cause deserialization failures on other validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Non-Determinism] Can differences in BTreeMap iteration order across Rust versions or platforms cause to_bytes() to produce different serialized outputs for the same logical state, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Gas Metering Bypass] Is the gas cost for insert() operations properly metered based on the size of Vec<u8> values, or can an attacker insert extremely large byte arrays with insufficient gas charges, causing DoS through storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Default Implementation] Does the Default trait implementation create an empty BTreeMap, and can this be exploited to create ObjectGroupResource instances that bypass initialization logic in Move code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: insert()] [Concurrent Modification] If multiple transactions in a parallel execution block modify the same ObjectGroupResource through insert(), are the changes properly ordered and committed to avoid race conditions that could lead to lost updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Error Handling] Does to_bytes() properly propagate BCS serialization errors, or could silent failures during serialization cause validators to commit incorrect state roots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Arbitrary Trait] Can the Arbitrary trait implementation generate ObjectGroupResource instances with malicious StructTag keys or invalid Vec<u8> values that could expose bugs in property-based tests or fuzzing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Type Safety] Does the BTreeMap properly validate that StructTag keys represent legitimate Move types, or can an attacker insert keys with non-existent module/struct combinations to bypass type safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Key Overwrite] Can an attacker exploit insert() to overwrite system-critical StructTag entries by crafting keys that match protected object types, potentially corrupting framework resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: insert()] [Return Value Misuse] If Move code calling insert() ignores the Option<Vec<u8>> return value indicating an overwrite, could this lead to silent data loss or security violations where overwrites should be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [BCS Encoding] Can differences in BCS encoding of StructTag keys across different serialization contexts cause the same logical key to be treated as different keys in the BTreeMap, leading to duplicate entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Size Limit] Does to_bytes() enforce maximum serialization size limits, or can an attacker create ObjectGroupResource instances that serialize to multi-GB byte arrays, causing memory exhaustion during state commitment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Storage Cost] Is the storage cost for ObjectGroupResource properly calculated based on the actual BTreeMap size and Vec<u8> value sizes, or can attackers exploit underpriced storage to bloat the state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Merkle Tree Integration] When ObjectGroupResource is stored in the Jellyfish Merkle tree, does the serialization order guarantee that identical logical states produce identical Merkle roots across all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Compression Attacks] Could an attacker craft BTreeMap contents that achieve poor compression ratios or trigger worst-case compression behavior in storage layers, causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Deserialization Attack] When deserializing ObjectGroupResource from storage, are there proper bounds checks to prevent maliciously crafted BCS data from causing buffer overflows or panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Module Name Constant] Does the MODULE_NAME constant 'object' match the actual Move module name, and could a mismatch cause resource access failures or allow unauthorized access to object resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Integer Overflow] Can the guid_creation_num field overflow after 2^64 GUID creations, and what happens when it wraps around - does this cause GUID collisions or predictable GUID generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [GUID Initialization] Does new() always initialize guid_creation_num to 0, and could this be exploited to predict or collide with GUIDs generated by newly created objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [GUID Race Condition] If multiple transactions increment guid_creation_num concurrently during parallel execution, could race conditions cause duplicate GUIDs to be generated for different objects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [GUID Persistence] Is guid_creation_num properly persisted across object transfers, or could transfer operations reset it and cause GUID reuse vulnerabilities? (High)",
