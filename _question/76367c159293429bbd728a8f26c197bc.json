  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Async task spawning] [Panic propagation] Do panics in spawned tasks properly propagate to tests, or are they silently ignored, hiding Byzantine-induced crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [HashMap usage] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent reads and writes to node_consensus_txs HashMap cause data races despite Mutex protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Clone patterns] [Arc clone cost] Does frequent Arc::clone() of large structures introduce performance bottlenecks that mask scalability issues under Byzantine load? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [NetworkSender integration] [Validator verifier bypass] Can the test infrastructure skip validator_verifier checks that would catch Byzantine signatures in production? (Critical)",
