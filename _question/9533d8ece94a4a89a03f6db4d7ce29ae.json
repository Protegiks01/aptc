  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Malformed JSON in payload] Can the payload contain malformed JSON that crashes parsers when observers try to inspect or validate the UnsupportedJWK, causing consensus disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Executable payload] If the payload is later executed or evaluated (e.g., in debugging tools or explorers), can it contain malicious scripts or code injection payloads that compromise observer nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Compression bomb] Can the payload be a highly compressed data structure that expands to enormous size when processed, causing DoS on nodes that attempt to validate or display it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [BCS length prefix overflow] When serializing Vec<u8> fields, can the BCS length prefix encoding be manipulated to cause integer overflow when deserializing, allocating incorrect buffer sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Canonical encoding] Does BCS serialization guarantee canonical encoding for UnsupportedJWK? Can the same logical struct be serialized in multiple ways, breaking consensus hash comparisons? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [State transition validation] When UnsupportedJWKs are updated in consensus state, are there checks to ensure valid state transitions (e.g., version increments, no downgrades)? Can attackers force invalid state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Orphaned state] If an UnsupportedJWK is deleted but references to it still exist in other parts of the state, can this cause dangling references or use-after-free style bugs in the state machine? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Network bandwidth] Can validators propose UnsupportedJWKs with maximum-size payloads repeatedly to exhaust network bandwidth during consensus gossip, degrading network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [CPU exhaustion] Does processing large UnsupportedJWK payloads through SHA3-256 hashing consume significant CPU resources? Can this be exploited to slow down block processing and reduce throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [ValidatorTransaction bypass] When UnsupportedJWKs are included in ValidatorTransactions (as mentioned in transaction.proto), can malicious validators bypass normal transaction validation rules by embedding them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Transaction size limits] Are there size limits on ValidatorTransactions containing UnsupportedJWKs? Can oversized JWKs bypass block size limits, causing blocks to exceed protocol constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Deeply nested JSON] Can extremely deeply nested JSON objects cause stack overflow during to_string() conversion, crashing validator nodes during JWK ingestion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Recursive JSON] Can self-referential or circular JSON structures cause infinite loops or unbounded memory allocation during conversion to payload bytes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Special JSON values] How are special JSON values (null, Infinity, NaN) serialized to bytes? Can these cause unexpected id generation or downstream parsing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Derive: Object] [API exposure] The struct derives poem_openapi_derive::Object at line 13. If this exposes UnsupportedJWK creation through public APIs, can external attackers inject malicious JWKs without going through consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Derive: Object] [Input validation] Does the OpenAPI integration perform input validation on id and payload fields? Can API consumers bypass size limits or inject malicious data directly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Trait: AsMoveValue] [Move-Rust mismatch] If the Move definition of UnsupportedJWK (0x1::jwks::UnsupportedJWK) changes but the Rust struct isn't updated, can this cause deserialization failures or state corruption during upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Type migration] If UnsupportedJWKs stored on-chain need to be migrated to a new format, is there a safe migration path, or would this require a hard fork with potential for state loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [SQL injection via id] If the id field is used in database queries without proper escaping, can special characters in the id bytes cause SQL injection vulnerabilities in off-chain indexers or explorers? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Platform-dependent serialization] Does serde_json::Value.to_string() produce identical output across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)? Can platform differences break consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: new_with_payload()] [Endianness issues] Is the SHA3-256 implementation endianness-independent? Can different validator architectures produce different id values for the same payload? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Breaking changes] If new required fields are added to UnsupportedJWK in future versions, can old validators fail to deserialize new JWKs, causing consensus split during rolling upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Backward compatibility] Are old UnsupportedJWKs from earlier protocol versions still valid? Can downgrade attacks force the network to accept outdated or vulnerable JWK formats? (High)",
