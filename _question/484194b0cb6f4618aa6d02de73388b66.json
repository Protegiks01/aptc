  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 10-12] [Memory corruption] Can an attacker exploit the conditional compilation of jemalloc allocator to cause memory safety issues when the binary is compiled on non-Unix systems where jemalloc is not active, potentially leading to different memory behavior and exploitation of allocator-specific vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 10-12] [Resource exhaustion] Does the jemalloc global allocator have proper memory limits configured, or can an attacker trigger unbounded memory allocation through malicious debugger commands that exhaust validator node memory and cause consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 12] [Allocator vulnerability] Is the jemalloc version used susceptible to known CVEs (e.g., heap overflow, use-after-free), and can an attacker exploit these through crafted debugger operations to achieve remote code execution on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 10-12] [Platform-specific attack] Can an attacker exploit the platform-specific allocator behavior differences between Unix (jemalloc) and non-Unix (system allocator) systems to create non-deterministic memory patterns that could affect debugging output consistency across validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Information disclosure] Does Logger::new().level(Level::Info).init() properly sanitize sensitive data (private keys, validator credentials, state proofs) before logging, or can an attacker access log files to extract cryptographic material and compromise validator security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Log injection] Can an attacker inject malicious log entries through crafted debugger command inputs that bypass sanitization in Logger::new(), potentially poisoning audit trails or exploiting log parsing vulnerabilities in monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Resource exhaustion] Does the Logger initialization have rate limiting or size constraints, or can an attacker trigger excessive logging through debugger commands that fill disk space and cause validator node failures affecting consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Privilege escalation] Is the Logger::init() call idempotent and thread-safe, or can race conditions during concurrent debugger invocations cause logger reinitialization that bypasses security configurations or exposes privileged information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Configuration bypass] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables or configuration files to override the Level::Info setting and enable debug/trace logging that exposes internal state machine transitions, consensus voting decisions, or cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 17] [Information disclosure] Does MetricsPusher::start(vec![]) expose sensitive metrics (validator performance, block proposal timing, state access patterns) that could be used by attackers to identify optimal timing for consensus attacks or state manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 17] [Resource leak] Is the MetricsPusher properly dropped/cleaned up, or can repeated debugger invocations cause metric pusher thread leaks that exhaust system resources and degrade validator node performance affecting consensus participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 17] [Side channel] Can an attacker monitor metrics pushed by this debugger instance to infer information about debugging activities (which transactions are being analyzed, which state is being accessed) and correlate with live network attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 17] [Network attack] If MetricsPusher attempts to push metrics to external endpoints, can an attacker perform SSRF attacks by manipulating metric destinations to exfiltrate data from validator nodes or scan internal networks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14] [Tokio runtime] Does the #[tokio::main] macro properly configure runtime thread limits and task spawning controls, or can an attacker exhaust the async runtime by triggering unbounded task creation through debugger commands affecting validator node responsiveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14] [Panic handling] If a panic occurs in the async runtime during Cmd::parse().run().await, does tokio properly catch and handle it, or can an attacker trigger panics that crash the debugger process while holding database locks causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14] [Async cancellation] Are async operations in Cmd::run() properly cancellation-safe, or can attacker-triggered cancellations (SIGTERM, Ctrl+C) during critical database operations cause incomplete writes to AptosDB resulting in state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14-19] [Race condition] Can concurrent invocations of the debugger create race conditions in the tokio runtime initialization or shared resource access (database connections, file handles) leading to data races that corrupt validator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Input validation] Does Cmd::parse() properly validate and sanitize command-line arguments, or can an attacker inject malicious paths, SQL-like patterns, or shell metacharacters that bypass validation in subcommands (AptosDb, Decode, DumpPendingTxns, Move)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Path traversal] Can an attacker use Cmd::parse() to supply crafted file paths (../../, symlinks, absolute paths) that allow reading/writing arbitrary files outside the intended AptosDB directory, potentially accessing validator private keys or system files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Command injection] If Cmd::parse() accepts database paths or transaction identifiers, can an attacker inject shell commands or format string specifiers that get executed during subcommand processing achieving remote code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Integer overflow] Does command-line parsing handle numeric inputs (block heights, version numbers, offsets) with proper bounds checking, or can integer overflows cause memory corruption during database queries or transaction decoding? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Panic on error] If Cmd::parse().run().await encounters errors (database corruption, invalid transactions, consensus data inconsistencies), does it panic or exit ungracefully leaving database in inconsistent state requiring manual recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Error propagation] Are errors from subcommands (AptosDb, Decode, DumpPendingTxns, Move) properly propagated with sufficient context, or do silent failures mask critical security issues like failed authentication checks or permission violations?
