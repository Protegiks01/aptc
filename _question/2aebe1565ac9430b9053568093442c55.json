  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Overall design] [Concurrent access] If LeftScreen and RightScreen implementations are used in multi-threaded contexts (e.g., serving multiple viewer requests), are there race conditions in shared state access? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Overall design] [Memory lifecycle] Can SourceContext objects returned by source_for_code_location outlive the source data they reference, causing use-after-free when the viewer is reset? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [Field: left] [String truncation] Can extremely long code locations cause the 'left' context field to be truncated in unexpected ways that lose important context or cause misalignment with highlight? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [Field: highlight] [Empty string handling] What happens if highlight is an empty string - can this cause display rendering issues or off-by-one errors in cursor positioning? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Struct: SourceContext] [Field: remainder] [Boundary calculation] If the remainder field calculation has off-by-one errors, can this cause overlapping or missing characters in the displayed source context? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Empty module] How do the traits handle completely empty Move modules with no functions - can get_source_index_for_line return invalid data or cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Missing source map] If a compiled module has no source map available, how does RightScreen::source_for_code_location handle this - can it return confusing or incorrect results? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Line 0 or column 0] Are line and column parameters 0-indexed or 1-indexed in get_source_index_for_line, and can confusion about this lead to off-by-one errors in source mapping? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum line numbers] What happens when line numbers approach usize::MAX - are there integer overflow checks in implementations that perform line-based arithmetic? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Unicode handling] Can Move source files with multi-byte Unicode characters cause column offset calculations to be incorrect when mapping bytecode to source? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Edge case] [Nested generics] Can deeply nested generic type parameters in LeftScreen::SourceIndex or RightScreen<Indexer> cause compiler issues or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Documentation] [Trait contract] Do the trait definitions specify invariants about what constitutes a valid SourceIndex, or can implementations vary in their interpretation leading to incompatibility? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Documentation] [Error conditions] Are the conditions under which source_for_code_location should return Err() documented, or can different implementations handle errors inconsistently? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Documentation] [Thread safety] Is there any documentation about whether LeftScreen and RightScreen implementations must be Sync/Send for concurrent use? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/interfaces.rs] [Documentation] [Ownership model] Does the trait design clarify ownership of returned SourceContext objects and whether they can be cached or must be regenerated each time? (Low)"
