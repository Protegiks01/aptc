(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: valid_duplication()] [Size Parameter] The test uses size parameter 20 - is this sufficient to generate complex modules that could expose subtle duplication bugs, or should larger values be tested to catch edge cases in production-sized modules?
