  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Owner Validation] Does the owner field (AccountAddress) undergo validation to prevent zero addresses, system addresses, or other invalid addresses from becoming object owners? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [Owner Initialization] Can new() be called with arbitrary AccountAddress values, including addresses that don't exist or belong to malicious actors, allowing unauthorized object ownership claims? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Ownership Transfer] When owner is modified (not shown in this file), are there proper checks to ensure the new owner is authorized, or could unauthorized ownership transfers lead to asset theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Owner Impersonation] Can an attacker create ObjectCoreResource instances with owner set to another user's address, potentially claiming ownership of objects they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Serialization of Owner] Does BCS serialization of the owner AccountAddress preserve all 32 bytes correctly, or could truncation/padding issues cause ownership to be corrupted during storage or transmission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Transfer Gate Bypass] Can the allow_ungated_transfer flag be manipulated after object creation to enable unauthorized transfers, bypassing intended access control restrictions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [Transfer Permission Default] Does new() allow callers to set allow_ungated_transfer to true without validation, potentially creating objects that can be transferred by anyone in violation of security policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Boolean Serialization] Does BCS encoding of the allow_ungated_transfer bool guarantee deterministic representation across all platforms, or could bool representation differences cause consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Permission Escalation] If allow_ungated_transfer is false, are there code paths that incorrectly ignore this flag and allow transfers anyway, leading to unauthorized asset movement? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Transfer Flag Tampering] Can parallel transactions racing on the same object create inconsistent states where allow_ungated_transfer has different values across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Event Handle Validation] Does the transfer_events EventHandle undergo proper initialization and validation, or can malformed EventHandle instances cause event emission failures or event log corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: transfer_events()] [Event Handle Exposure] Does the transfer_events() getter properly protect the EventHandle from unauthorized modifications, or could callers obtain mutable references and corrupt event state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [Event Handle Initialization] Can new() be called with EventHandle instances that have manipulated counter values or GUID fields, allowing attackers to control event sequencing or forge event history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Event Replay] If transfer_events EventHandle is improperly initialized or cloned, could this enable event replay attacks where the same transfer events are emitted multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Event Ordering] Does the EventHandle guarantee strict ordering of transfer events, or could race conditions during parallel execution cause transfer events to be emitted out of order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [BCS Deserialization] When deserializing ObjectCoreResource from storage or network, are there proper validation checks to prevent malformed data from creating invalid object states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Field Order Dependency] Does the order of fields (guid_creation_num, owner, allow_ungated_transfer, transfer_events) in BCS serialization match across all code paths, or could field reordering cause deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Version Compatibility] If ObjectCoreResource structure changes in future protocol versions, are there migration paths that prevent existing objects from being corrupted or made inaccessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Partial Deserialization] Could an attacker send truncated BCS-encoded ObjectCoreResource data that deserializes partially, creating objects with uninitialized fields or corrupted state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Serialization Size] Is there a maximum size limit enforced for serialized ObjectCoreResource instances, or could extremely large EventHandle structures cause unbounded memory consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Module Name Constant] Does the MODULE_NAME 'object' match the actual Move module implementing object logic, and could mismatches cause resource type confusion in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Struct Name Constant] Does the STRUCT_NAME 'ObjectCore' exactly match the Move struct definition, and could naming mismatches allow unauthorized access to object core resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [MoveResource Trait] Does the MoveResource trait implementation properly integrate with the Move VM's resource safety guarantees, or could this Rust-side representation violate Move's linearity requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Resource Duplication] Can ObjectCoreResource instances be duplicated or copied in Rust code in ways that violate Move's resource uniqueness guarantees, allowing double-spending of objects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Type Safety Bypass] Could direct manipulation of ObjectCoreResource in Rust code bypass Move's type system checks and safety guarantees enforced at the bytecode level? (High)"
