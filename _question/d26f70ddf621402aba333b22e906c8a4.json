  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run(), Line 63] [Async/Await] Is the async run() function cancellation-safe, or can a Ctrl+C during compaction leave partially written files that corrupt the backup chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Tokio Runtime] Does the function assume a specific tokio runtime configuration, or can running under a single-threaded runtime cause deadlocks in storage operations? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Type Safety] Are the usize compact_factor fields bounds-checked before being passed to BackupCompactor, or can platform-specific usize differences (32-bit vs 64-bit) cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run(), Lines 66-75] [Atomic Operations] Is the entire compaction operation atomic, or can power failure/crash during compaction leave some epoch metadata compacted and others not, breaking restore consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run(), Line 75] [Rollback Safety] If compactor.run().await? fails, is there a rollback mechanism to undo partial compaction, or are backup metadata left in a corrupted state requiring manual recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Consistency] Can different compact_factor values for epochs vs. transactions cause temporal misalignment where transaction metadata references non-existent compacted epoch metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Chain Integrity] Does compaction preserve cryptographic proof chains, or can compacting metadata break Merkle proof verification during state restoration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Compaction Boundaries] Can an attacker manipulate compact_factor values to create compaction boundaries that split critical epoch-ending proofs across multiple files, breaking consensus verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run(), Line 71] [Handle Leaks] If init_storage() is called multiple times (e.g., in a loop), are storage handles properly closed, or can this leak file descriptors/connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Memory Safety] Does the function properly bound memory usage, or can loading large metadata files (via ReadMetadata) cause OOM in memory-constrained environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Field: remove_compacted_file_after, Lines 41-46] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker predict the exact removal time of compacted files and inject malicious metadata just before removal to avoid detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Field: remove_compacted_file_after] [Clock Skew] If the system running backup maintenance has incorrect time settings, can files be removed prematurely (clock fast) or never removed (clock slow), causing operational failures?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: ReadMetadataOpt, Line 59] [Empty Path] If the path field is an empty string, does load_json_file() handle this gracefully, or can it access unintended default locations or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: ReadMetadataOpt, Line 59] [Unicode Path] Are Unicode and multi-byte characters in the path field properly handled, or can encoding mismatches cause file access failures or security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Negative Values] Although compact_factor fields are usize (unsigned), can command-line parsing accept negative values that wrap around to large positive values, bypassing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run(), Lines 66-75] [Restore Failure] If compaction creates invalid metadata structure (e.g., missing version ranges), can this permanently prevent restoration of blockchain state at specific epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Version Continuity] Does the compaction logic ensure version number continuity in compacted transaction metadata, or can gaps/overlaps cause transaction replay to produce incorrect state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: DBToolStorageOpt] [File Permissions] When storage is initialized for local filesystem, are file permissions properly set to prevent unauthorized reads of sensitive backup metadata? (High)",
