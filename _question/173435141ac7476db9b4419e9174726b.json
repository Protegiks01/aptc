  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Integration: ValidatorSet] [Config versioning] If validator set config changes format between epochs, do all validators agree on which version to use, or can version mismatches split the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Integration: Consensus] [Config caching] If consensus code caches OnChainConfig values, can stale caches persist after epoch transitions causing validators to use outdated rules? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Integration: Storage] [Config history pruning] Does storage pruning preserve config history needed for replaying old transactions, or can pruning break historical validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Edge case: Epoch 0] [Genesis handling] Does epoch 0 have special handling, or can logic that assumes epoch > 0 underflow and cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Edge case: Epoch MAX] [Maximum epoch] What happens when epoch reaches u64::MAX, can the system continue or does it require a hard fork? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Edge case: Missing config] [Fallback behavior] When fetch_config() returns None, do validators use safe defaults or panic, and are defaults consistent across all implementations? (High)",
