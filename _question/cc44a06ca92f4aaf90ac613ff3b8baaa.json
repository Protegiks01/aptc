  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Privilege escalation] Can prebuilt packages contain modules that impersonate system modules or use reserved addresses to gain unauthorized privileges when published during benchmark initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Cross-module exploitation] Can malicious dependencies between prebuilt packages create exploit chains where one compromised module enables attacks in dependent modules, bypassing Move's module isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Race condition] Is the Lazy<PrebuiltPackagesBundle> initialization thread-safe, or can concurrent access from multiple threads during first initialization cause race conditions that result in partially initialized state, corrupted data, or multiple deserialization attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Panic propagation] If deserialization panics during lazy initialization in one thread, does the panic propagate correctly to other threads, or can it leave the Lazy wrapper in a poisoned state causing subsequent access attempts to fail or behave unpredictably? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Initialization timing] Can an attacker trigger lazy initialization at a critical time (e.g., during consensus or block execution) where the deserialization overhead causes performance degradation or timeout-based attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Memory ordering] Does once_cell::sync::Lazy provide proper memory barriers to ensure that all fields of the deserialized PrebuiltPackagesBundle are fully visible to all threads after initialization, or can relaxed memory ordering cause threads to observe partially constructed objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Double initialization] Can an attacker exploit scenarios where Lazy initialization fails but doesn't panic, potentially allowing multiple initialization attempts that could lead to inconsistent state or double execution of initialization logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 22-25] [Static lifetime issues] Since PREBUILT_BUNDLE has 'static lifetime, does this prevent proper cleanup on process shutdown, potentially leaving resources leaked or causing issues in testing scenarios where multiple initializations are needed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Metadata manipulation] Can PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain malicious PackageMetadata with crafted name, version, or dependency fields that cause conflicts, shadowing, or unexpected behavior when packages are published to the blockchain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Dependency confusion] Can the packages BTreeMap contain dependency specifications that reference malicious external packages or create circular dependencies that cause stack overflow during module resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Name collision] Can two packages in the PrebuiltPackagesBundle have the same name but different content, and does the BTreeMap properly handle this or can it cause undefined behavior where the wrong package is selected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Version confusion] Can prebuilt packages specify incompatible or malicious version constraints that cause dependency resolution failures or allow downgrade attacks when packages interact with on-chain framework modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Module name spoofing] Can prebuilt packages contain modules with names that spoof system modules (e.g., aptos_framework::coin) to intercept or manipulate transactions during workload execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Empty packages] Can the PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain empty packages (no modules, no scripts) that cause null pointer dereferences, panics, or unexpected behavior when accessed through package_bundle()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Malformed module names] Can prebuilt packages contain modules with invalid or malicious names (e.g., control characters, Unicode exploits, path traversal sequences) that cause issues when modules are loaded or logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Script array bounds] Can the scripts Vec<Vec<u8>> in PrebuiltPackage contain more than the expected single script, violating the assumption in entry_point_trait.rs that 'only single script per package is supported' and causing indexing errors or unexpected execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 28-35] [Public exposure] Is PreBuiltPackagesImpl::package_bundle() safely accessible to all code that can reach this module, or can untrusted code obtain references to the prebuilt packages and abuse them for malicious purposes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Reference leaking] Does package_bundle() returning &PrebuiltPackagesBundle create lifetime issues or allow external code to hold long-lived references that could be used after the packages should be invalidated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 28-35] [Trait implementation safety] Can other code in the codebase implement the PreBuiltPackages trait with malicious package bundles and substitute them through trait objects, bypassing the intended prebuilt packages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 28-35] [Static mutability] Even though PREBUILT_BUNDLE is static, are there unsafe operations elsewhere in the codebase that could obtain mutable references to it and modify the supposedly immutable package data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Publisher authority] When prebuilt packages are published during transaction workload generation, do they execute with special privileges or bypass normal publishing restrictions that could be abused? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [VM compatibility] Are the prebuilt packages compiled for the exact Move VM version being used, or can version mismatches cause bytecode compatibility issues, VM crashes, or security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Experiment flags] Were the prebuilt packages compiled with experimental compiler flags that enable unsafe features, and if so, do these experimental features introduce vulnerabilities when modules are executed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Bytecode version] Do the module bytecode versions in prebuilt packages match the VM's expected version, or can version mismatches cause the VM to execute modules with incorrect semantics or skip validation checks? (High)",
