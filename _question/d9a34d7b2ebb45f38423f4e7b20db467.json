  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [URI Length] Is there a maximum length check on the URI parameter to prevent memory exhaustion from extremely long URLs (e.g., 10MB+ URI strings)? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Null Bytes] Can null bytes (\\\\x00) in the URI string cause truncation or bypass validation checks in the underlying reqwest or URL parsing libraries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Memory Leak] Does the exponential backoff retry logic (lines 80-96) properly clean up resources if retries are exhausted, or could failed attempts leak memory from partial HTTP responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Memory Allocation] When serde_json parses the response at lines 66-69, is there unbounded memory allocation that could cause OOM crashes with pathological JSON inputs? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Response Buffering] Does reqwest buffer the entire HTTP response in memory before parsing JSON, potentially causing memory exhaustion even if size checks pass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [CPU Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide URIs to servers that return extremely large but valid JSON (just under max_file_size_bytes) repeatedly to exhaust CPU resources during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Disk I/O] If responses are cached or temporarily stored on disk, can an attacker flood the system with unique URIs to exhaust disk space or I/O bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Thread Pool Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit thousands of URIs that trigger the maximum retry timeout, blocking all available worker threads and preventing legitimate requests from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [DNS Amplification] Can an attacker use URIs with domains that trigger expensive DNS lookups or DNSSEC validation, multiplying resource consumption per request? (Low)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Code Injection] If the returned JSON Value (line 75) is used in string interpolation or command execution downstream, can an attacker inject shell commands or code through crafted JSON fields?
