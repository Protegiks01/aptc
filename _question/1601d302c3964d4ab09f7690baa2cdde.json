  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: string] [Empty pattern search] How does native_index_of handle empty pattern strings - does it return 0 or the string length, and is this behavior consistent with Move contract expectations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [Comparison consistency] native_compare calls Value.compare() - is this comparison deterministic across all validator nodes regardless of Rust version, memory layout, or platform? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [Gas calculation overflow] Gas cost uses CMP_COMPARE_PER_ABS_VAL_UNIT * (size1 + size2) - can extremely large values cause integer overflow in gas calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [Deep structure comparison] abs_val_size_dereferenced follows references deeply - can attackers create circular reference structures to cause infinite loops or stack overflow during size calculation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [Ordering variant confusion] The ordering result uses variant tags (0=Less, 1=Equal, 2=Greater) - can these be confused with other enum variants or manipulated in Move code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [NaN and special values] How does native_compare handle special numeric values like NaN, infinity, or -0.0 - is the behavior consistent with Move's numeric semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: cmp] [Argument count invariant] The function has a debug_assert for 2 arguments but also runtime check - can the runtime check be bypassed allowing wrong number of arguments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: mem] [Feature flag check] native_swap checks is_native_memory_operations_enabled() - what happens if this flag state differs between validators during transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: mem] [Reference validation] Does swap_values properly validate that both Reference parameters are mutable and point to distinct memory locations, preventing self-swap undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: mem] [Type mismatch swap] Can native_swap be called with References to values of different types, and if so, does swap_values perform runtime type checking to prevent type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: mem] [Gas pricing] MEM_SWAP_BASE is a fixed cost regardless of value size - can attackers swap extremely large values at under-priced gas cost? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Dynamic dispatch attack] native_resolve dynamically resolves and returns function closures - can attackers use this to call privileged functions that should not be dynamically callable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Module ID forgery] native_resolve constructs ModuleId from user-provided address and module name - can attackers forge module IDs to resolve functions from protected system modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Identifier validation bypass] identifier_from_string validates identifiers, but does it enforce Move's identifier rules (alphanumeric, underscore) or can special characters be injected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Type parameter mismatch] native_resolve accepts a type parameter fun_ty - can attackers provide incorrect type arguments that don't match the resolved function signature, causing type unsafety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Closure capture bypass] The function returns a closure with no captured arguments - can attackers manipulate the closure state after creation to inject captured values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Gas metering escape] The comment says 'loader context function takes care of gas metering' - is this gas metering correctly applied to prevent excessive dynamic resolution operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [Error code leakage] native_resolve returns error codes (like INVALID_IDENTIFIER) to Move - can these error codes leak information about internal VM state or module structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: reflect] [StructRef borrow safety] identifier_from_string uses borrow_field(0) - can attackers craft malicious structs that violate borrow checking invariants during field access? (Medium)",
