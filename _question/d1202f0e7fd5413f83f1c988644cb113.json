  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Architecture: Global State] [Lazy Initialization Race] Are the Lazy statics for HOSTNAME, NAMESPACE, and RUST_LOG_FIELD_MAX_LEN (lines 52, 198, 204) properly synchronized during concurrent first access, or could race conditions cause multiple initializations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Architecture: RwLock Usage] [Lock Poisoning] If a thread panics while holding the RwLock write lock on filter (line 540), will the lock become poisoned causing all future log operations to fail and validator to stop logging consensus events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosData::enabled()] [Filter Check Performance] Does the filter check at line 570 acquire a read lock on every log event, and could high log rates cause lock contention that degrades consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosData::record()] [Thread Name Allocation] Does ::std::thread::current().name() at line 576 allocate memory for thread name lookup on each log event, and could this cause performance degradation during high-throughput consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new()] [BTreeMap Allocation] Is the BTreeMap allocation at line 237 bounded, or could an attacker provide log entries with thousands of key-value pairs causing memory exhaustion and validator OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: build_filter()] [RUST_LOG Injection] Can an attacker with environment control set RUST_LOG to a regex that matches everything (like 'trace'), causing excessive logging that fills disk and impacts validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: build_filter()] [RUST_LOG_TELEMETRY Injection] Can setting RUST_LOG_TELEMETRY to 'off' disable all telemetry logging at line 411-417, preventing security monitoring from detecting Byzantine validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: init_for_testing()] [Testing in Production] If init_for_testing() at line 523 is accidentally called in production, does it override production logging configuration causing debug logs to expose sensitive validator state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new()] [Timestamp Consistency] Are log timestamps at line 248 guaranteed to be monotonic across log entries, or could clock adjustments cause timestamps to go backwards, breaking log analysis that assumes temporal ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new()] [Metadata Copy] Is the metadata copy at line 191 a deep copy or shallow copy, and could shared metadata state cause race conditions if metadata is modified after logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerService filter checks] [Double Filtering] Are logs filtered twice - once in AptosData::enabled() and again in LoggerService (lines 634-641, 646-653) - and could filter inconsistency cause logs to be dropped unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerService::run()] [Channel Memory] When the sync_channel fills up, does backpressure properly propagate to senders, or could unbounded sender retry loops cause CPU spinning and performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: StdoutWriter::new()] [BufWriter Capacity] Does BufWriter at line 701 use default capacity which may be too small or too large for validator workloads, causing either frequent flushes or excessive memory usage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosDataBuilder::build()] [Arc Reference Count] Could the Arc<AptosData> returned at line 476 be cloned excessively causing reference count overflow (unlikely but theoretically possible with isize), leading to use-after-free? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new() peer_id] [Identity Spoofing] Can the peer_id from aptos_node_identity::peer_id_as_str() at line 215 be spoofed if the node_identity feature is compromised, allowing Byzantine validators to impersonate others in logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new() chain_id] [Chain ID Validation] Is the chain_id from aptos_node_identity::chain_id() at line 216 validated, or could an incorrect chain_id in logs cause monitoring systems to misattribute validator behavior across chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LogEntry::new() hostname] [Hostname Spoofing] Can an attacker with container privileges spoof the hostname returned by hostname::get() at line 199, causing logs to appear from trusted validators when they're actually from compromised nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosData::send_entry()] [Formatter Error Path] If the formatter at line 553 returns Err(fmt::Error), is this caught, or will the expect() panic and crash the validator during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerService::run()] [Panic Propagation] If printer.write_buferred() panics at line 639, does this kill the LoggerService thread, and will subsequent log entries be silently dropped without any error indication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: text_format()] [Write Macro Failure] Can the write!() macros at lines 757-776 fail in ways other than fmt::Error, and if so, are these failures handled or could they cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosData filtering] [Read Lock Starvation] If writers frequently update filters via set_filter() at line 540, could read lock acquisition in enabled() at line 570 be starved, causing log drops during consensus? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter RwLock] [Write Lock Contention] With RwLock at line 720, multiple write() calls will serialize - could this create a bottleneck that slows consensus logging below acceptable performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: AptosDataBuilder::build()] [Double Initialization] If build() is called multiple times on the same AptosDataBuilder, does this create multiple LoggerService threads that all try to drain the same channel, causing race conditions? (Medium)",
