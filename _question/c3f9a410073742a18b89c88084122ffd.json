  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks()] [DNS Rebinding] Can an attacker use DNS rebinding attacks where the open_id_config_url initially resolves to a legitimate IP but later resolves to a malicious one, bypassing any initial validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks()] [TLS Validation] Does the underlying reqwest client properly validate TLS certificates? Can an attacker perform MitM attacks on validators' JWK fetches if TLS validation is disabled or weak? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks()] [Cookie Injection] In smoke-test mode, the my_addr is sent as a COOKIE header. Can this be exploited if the OIDC provider reflects cookies in responses, leading to XSS or injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks()] [Integer Overflow] If the JWKs response contains an extremely large number of keys, could parsing or processing them cause integer overflows in size calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Double Shutdown] Can shutdown() be called multiple times concurrently? Would this cause panics or undefined behavior when close_tx.send() is called on an already-consumed sender? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Graceful Termination] If the join_handle task is stuck in a long HTTP request when close_tx.send() is called, does await properly timeout or does it hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Error Handling] Both close_tx.send() and join_handle.await errors are silently ignored with let _. Could this mask critical shutdown failures that indicate compromised observer state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Resource Leaks] If shutdown() panics or is not called properly, do JWKObserver instances leak tokio tasks and HTTP client resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [Consensus Divergence] If different validators fetch JWKs at slightly different times and the OIDC provider updates keys in between, can this cause consensus disagreement where validators observe different JWK sets, preventing quorum certificate formation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [Channel Ordering] Does the aptos_channel guarantee FIFO ordering for pushed JWK observations? If not, can out-of-order delivery cause validators to process stale JWK updates after newer ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [JWK Validation] Does the JWK type implement proper validation? Can an attacker provide malformed JWK JSON that passes parsing but causes errors during cryptographic operations in keyless authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [Duplicate Observers] Can multiple JWKObserver instances be spawned for the same issuer? Would this cause duplicate JWK observations to be pushed to consensus, wasting resources or causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [Epoch Boundaries] When epochs change, are JWKObserver instances properly shutdown and respawned? Can stale observers from previous epochs continue running and interfere with current epoch JWK consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Integration] [Metrics Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate fetch timings to make OBSERVATION_SECONDS metrics misleading, hiding actual performance degradation or network issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Data Integrity] [Issuer Encoding] When issuer is converted to bytes with as_bytes().to_vec(), are there encoding normalization issues? Can equivalent URLs like 'https://example.com' and 'https://example.com/' produce different byte representations causing consensus mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Data Integrity] [JWK Deduplication] After sorting JWKs, are duplicates detected and handled? Can an OIDC provider return duplicate JWKs that cause issues in consensus or keyless verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Data Integrity] [Empty JWK Sets] If fetch_jwks returns an empty Vec<JWK>, is this treated as valid? Could an attacker cause all keyless accounts for an issuer to become unusable by returning empty JWK sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Data Integrity] [JWK Type Mismatch] Does the JWK::from() conversion in fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri handle all possible JSON structures? Can malformed JSON cause panics or produce invalid JWK objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Concurrency] [Task Cancellation] If the tokio task is cancelled externally (not via close_rx), does it clean up properly or leave partial state in observation_tx? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Concurrency] [Shared State] Are there any hidden shared mutable state between multiple JWKObserver instances that could cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Concurrency] [Async Cancellation Safety] If fetch_jwks is cancelled mid-execution, could this leave the HTTP client or network connections in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Concurrency] [Timer Precision] Does tokio::time::interval guarantee consistent timing across different system loads? Can heavy validator load cause JWK fetches to be delayed, leading to consensus disagreements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Network] [HTTP Version] Which HTTP version is used for fetching JWKs? Can HTTP/1.1 request smuggling or HTTP/2 vulnerabilities be exploited against validators? (Medium)",
