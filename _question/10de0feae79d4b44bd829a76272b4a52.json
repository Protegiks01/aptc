  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error! Macro] [Monitoring Evasion] At line 30, can an attacker craft error messages that evade monitoring patterns, hiding consensus attacks or invariant violations from alerting systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Classification] [Alert Fatigue] Can systematic triggering of code_invariant_error() cause alert fatigue in monitoring systems, masking genuine security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Const Evaluation] [Build-Time Attacks] Can compiler optimizations or const evaluation of error codes at lines 117-153 introduce non-determinism between different build configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Macro Expansion] [Compile-Time Code Injection] Could malicious macros in the tracing crate (line 8) inject code during error! macro expansion that subverts error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Conversion Chain] [Type Erasure Attack] During conversions at lines 46-61 and 91-102, can type information be deliberately erased to hide the true source of security violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [PanicOr Pattern Matching] [Match Exhaustiveness] Are the match statements at lines 65-68, 82-87, and 93-100 exhaustive? Could adding new enum variants break error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Generic Error Wrapping] [Nested Error Attack] Can an attacker create deeply nested PanicOr<PanicOr<PanicOr<...>>> structures that cause stack overflow during recursive unwrapping or pattern matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Status Code Mapping] [Reverse Engineering] Can attackers use the deterministic mapping from errors to status codes at lines 80-89 to reverse-engineer internal VM state or execution paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Error Context Loss] [Audit Trail Destruction] When PanicError is converted to VMError at line 59, does the Location::Undefined destroy audit trail information needed for forensic analysis after attacks? (Medium)"
