  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Concurrent downloads] Does concurrent_downloads parameter properly limit resource usage, or can excessively high values cause memory exhaustion DoS when downloading large backups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Compaction race condition] Can concurrent compaction operations corrupt metadata files when multiple processes try to merge the same epoch/snapshot/transaction files simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Factor exploitation] Can extremely large compact_factor values (epoch_ending_file_compact_factor, state_snapshot_file_compact_factor, transaction_file_compact_factor) cause memory exhaustion or integer overflow during compaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Premature deletion] Does remove_compacted_file_after timing properly ensure files aren't deleted while still being read by restore operations, preventing data loss during active restores? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Cleanup command] [TODO exploitation] Since Cleanup logic is unimplemented (TODO comment), can invoking this command cause undefined behavior or expose the system to attacks if accidentally called? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: ReadMetadata] [Path injection] Does the metadata file path parameter sanitize input to prevent reading arbitrary files from cloud storage or local filesystem using path traversal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: ReadMetadata] [JSON parsing exploit] Can malformed or malicious JSON in metadata files cause denial of service or memory exhaustion during serde_json deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Struct: CompactionOpt] [Time manipulation] Can the 86400 second default for remove_compacted_file_after be bypassed via system time manipulation, causing premature file deletion and backup corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: BackupCompactor::new()] [Validation bypass] Are compaction factor parameters validated to be > 0, or can zero/negative values cause division by zero or infinite loops during compaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Metadata cache poisoning] Can corrupted metadata_cache_opt cause the compactor to reference non-existent or malicious files, leading to data loss or injection of fake backup data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Storage backend integrity] Does init_storage() verify the integrity of the storage backend before compaction, or can it operate on a compromised storage system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [State poisoning] Can a malicious backup containing crafted state snapshots be restored to inject fake balances, unauthorized validators, or backdoored smart contracts into the production database? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Oneoff::EpochEnding] [Epoch transition exploit] Can restoring manipulated epoch ending data cause validators to accept an invalid validator set, enabling an attacker to control consensus with less than 1/3 stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Oneoff::StateSnapshot] [Merkle tree corruption] Can a maliciously crafted state snapshot restore corrupt the Jellyfish Merkle tree, causing state root mismatches that partition the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Oneoff::Transaction] [VerifyExecutionMode::NoVerify] Since transaction restore uses NoVerify mode, can an attacker restore transactions with invalid signatures or incorrect state transitions that would be rejected during normal execution?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: EpochEndingRestoreController::run()] [Epoch history manipulation] Since epoch_history is passed as None, can this cause the restore to skip critical epoch validation checks allowing invalid epoch transitions? (High)",
