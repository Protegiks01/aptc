  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Trait: TypeView] [Type confusion] Can an attacker implement TypeView incorrectly to return misleading TypeTags that bypass type safety checks in the Move VM, potentially allowing unauthorized resource access or type confusion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Trait: TypeView::to_type_tag()] [Type spoofing] Could a malicious implementation of to_type_tag() return a TypeTag for a privileged system type (like Coin or Account), allowing unauthorized operations on protected resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Trait: ValueView] [Gas manipulation] Can an attacker craft malicious ValueView implementations that underreport memory size in visit() to bypass gas metering and cause resource exhaustion on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Function: ValueView::visit()] [Recursion DoS] Does the visit() method have recursion depth limits, or can deeply nested structures cause stack overflow when traversing values, halting validator execution? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Function: ValueView::legacy_abstract_memory_size()] [Integer overflow] Can accumulated AbstractMemorySize values overflow during addition operations in the Acc visitor, wrapping around to small values and bypassing gas limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Constant: LEGACY_CONST_SIZE] [Gas manipulation] Is the LEGACY_CONST_SIZE of 16 bytes appropriate for all primitive types, or can attackers exploit this fixed size for u8/bool values to cause gas miscalculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Constant: LEGACY_REFERENCE_SIZE] [Reference gas bypass] Can attackers create deeply nested reference chains where each reference only costs 8 bytes, resulting in severely undercharged gas for complex reference structures? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Constant: LEGACY_CLOSURE_SIZE] [Closure gas manipulation] Is the 6-byte LEGACY_CLOSURE_SIZE sufficient for all closure types, or can complex closures with large captured environments bypass proper gas accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Lines 204-208] [Panic handling] The expect() call on line 206 states 'Legacy function: should not fail' - but can malicious implementations still cause panics here, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Function: ValueVisitor::visit_delayed()] [Delayed field bypass] Can attackers exploit visit_delayed() with malicious DelayedFieldID values to bypass gas metering, since the Acc implementation returns Ok(()) without charging? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/views.rs] [Function: ValueVisitor::visit_delayed()] [Missing implementation] The TODO comment on lines 51-53 indicates incomplete implementation - can this be exploited to create free delayed fields without proper gas accounting? (High)",
