  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Panic propagation] If a test panics inside runtime.spawn, does it properly propagate through join_all, or could panics be swallowed leading to incomplete test coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Return value] The function returns Ok(()) regardless of individual test outcomes - does this mask test failures when used programmatically? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error suppression] Does runtime.block_on use let _ = test_flows, intentionally suppressing errors and potentially hiding critical test infrastructure failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Blocking] Does block_on properly handle async cancellation and shutdown, or could it hang indefinitely if tests never complete? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Runtime lifecycle] After test_flows completes, does the runtime properly shut down and clean up all spawned tasks, or could zombie tasks remain running? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Task scheduling] Could the tokio runtime's task scheduler cause test execution order non-determinism that leads to flaky tests masking real issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Runtime reference] Is passing &Runtime to test_flows and using it for spawning safe, or could runtime lifetime issues cause problems if tests outlive the reference? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Network failure] If network_name points to an unavailable network (testnet/devnet down), do tests fail gracefully with clear errors, or do they hang/timeout obscuring the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [API endpoint security] Does the test suite validate that it's connecting to legitimate Aptos endpoints, or could NETWORK_NAME be hijacked to point tests at malicious APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [TLS verification] When tests connect to node and faucet URLs, is TLS certificate validation enforced, or could MITM attacks manipulate test results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Metrics exposure] Does MetricsPusher expose metrics endpoints without authentication, potentially leaking information about test infrastructure and API health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Metrics injection] Can an attacker manipulate metrics collection (e.g., through run_id injection) to corrupt observability data and hide real API failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Log injection] Does the info! macro in test_flows properly sanitize network_name and run_id, or could log injection attacks corrupt log analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [PII leakage] Could test execution logs inadvertently expose sensitive information (private keys, auth tokens) from test accounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment pollution] If environment variables are modified during test execution, could this affect concurrent test runs or subsequent executions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Config validation] Does the code validate that NUM_THREADS, STACK_SIZE, and NETWORK_NAME are within safe ranges, or can extreme values cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Default values] If environment variables are not set, are the default values in consts.rs secure and appropriate for all deployment environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Spawn ordering] The tests are spawned in sequence (NewAccount, CoinTransfer, NFT, etc.) - could timing windows between spawns create race conditions in test initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Handle collection] The join_all receives a vec! of handles - if handles are moved incorrectly or duplicated, could this cause undefined task behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Await semantics] Does join_all properly await all tasks to completion, or could early returns leave tasks running in the background? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [String cloning] Each test gets a cloned run_id string - with 5 concurrent tests, could excessive string allocation cause memory pressure in constrained environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Network handle leaks] If NetworkName or Client objects are not properly dropped after tests, could this leak file descriptors or network sockets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Runtime memory] Does the multi-threaded runtime with custom stack sizes properly account for total memory usage, or could it exceed system limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [NewAccount test] Could concurrent NewAccount test execution cause account address collisions or nonce conflicts if random number generation is not properly seeded per thread? (Low)",
