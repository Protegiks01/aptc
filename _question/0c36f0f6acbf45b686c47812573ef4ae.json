  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute_block_sharded()] [Arc state view safety] The function takes Arc<S> for state_view - can shared ownership allow concurrent modifications during execution causing non-deterministic results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor] [StateView Sync requirement] StateView must implement Sync - can implementations violate this by using non-thread-safe caches or mutable state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute_block_no_limit()] [Map error handling] The function uses .map() to convert BlockOutput - can errors during conversion be silently dropped causing data loss? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Type: TransactionSliceMetadata] [Unknown metadata exploitation] Can TransactionSliceMetadata::unknown() cause incorrect optimizations that lead to different execution results versus proper metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor] [Non-deterministic execution] Can implementations use non-deterministic operations (system time, random numbers, HashMap iteration) in execute_block() causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
