  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded data in the validator_network_addresses field that causes bcs::from_bytes to panic or consume excessive resources during deserialization, leading to consensus node crashes or DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Malformed data] Does the validator_network_addresses() method validate that the deserialized Vec<NetworkAddress> contains valid, well-formed network addresses, or can malformed addresses bypass validation and corrupt the validator set configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Empty vector] Can an attacker set validator_network_addresses to serialize to an empty Vec<NetworkAddress>, causing validators to have no reachable network addresses and breaking consensus connectivity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Size limit] Is there a maximum size limit enforced on the validator_network_addresses Vec<u8> field before deserialization, or can an attacker provide extremely large serialized data (e.g., gigabytes) causing memory exhaustion during bcs::from_bytes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Invalid BCS encoding] What happens if validator_network_addresses contains invalid BCS encoding that doesn't represent a valid Vec<NetworkAddress> - does this cause silent failures, panics, or is the error properly propagated to callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft BCS data in validator_network_addresses that deserializes to a Vec<NetworkAddress> but contains type-confused elements that later cause crashes when used by consensus networking code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Duplicate addresses] Does the deserialization validate that there are no duplicate NetworkAddress entries in the validator_network_addresses, or can duplicates cause issues in consensus peer connection management? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Localhost addresses] Can an attacker set validator_network_addresses to contain localhost (127.0.0.1) or link-local addresses that would make the validator unreachable to other nodes, effectively removing them from consensus participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Unresolvable DNS] If NetworkAddress supports DNS names, can an attacker provide unresolvable or malicious DNS entries that cause resolution timeouts or redirect consensus traffic to attacker-controlled servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: validator_network_addresses()] [Port hijacking] Can validator_network_addresses specify privileged ports (<1024) or ports used by other system services, causing port conflicts or security issues when validators attempt to bind to these addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: fullnode_network_addresses()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded data in fullnode_network_addresses that exploits vulnerabilities in bcs::from_bytes deserialization, causing fullnode crashes or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: fullnode_network_addresses()] [State poisoning] If fullnode_network_addresses contains invalid data, can this poison the state such that legitimate fullnodes cannot sync from this validator, effectively partitioning the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: fullnode_network_addresses()] [Empty addresses] Can fullnode_network_addresses be set to an empty vector, making the validator's fullnode endpoint unreachable and preventing public access to blockchain data through this validator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: fullnode_network_addresses()] [Phishing attack] Can an attacker set fullnode_network_addresses to point to attacker-controlled servers that serve malicious blockchain data to users querying this validator's fullnode endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Function: fullnode_network_addresses()] [Cross-protocol confusion] Can fullnode_network_addresses and validator_network_addresses overlap or point to the same endpoints, causing protocol confusion where consensus messages are sent to fullnode ports or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Invalid key] Does the ValidatorConfig struct validate that consensus_public_key is a valid BLS12-381 public key on the correct subgroup, or can an attacker provide identity points or invalid curve points that break signature aggregation in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Key reuse] Can multiple validators share the same consensus_public_key, allowing one compromised validator to forge signatures for another validator and break consensus safety assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Weak keys] Is there validation to prevent the use of weak or known-compromised BLS public keys (e.g., keys with small discrete logs) that would allow attackers to forge signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Key rotation race] During consensus key rotation, can race conditions in reading the old vs new consensus_public_key from ValidatorConfig cause signature verification failures or allow double-signing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Proof of possession] Does ValidatorConfig require proof-of-possession (PoP) for the consensus_public_key to prevent rogue-key attacks where an attacker constructs a public key as a function of honest validators' keys?
