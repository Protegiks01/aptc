  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Safety Data Corruption] If save_config() fails to atomically write SafetyRulesConfig containing last_voted_round data, can this cause validators to double-vote on restart, breaking consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Waypoint Manipulation] Can an attacker modify the SafetyRulesConfig file to change the trusted waypoint, causing validators to accept invalid blockchain states and participate in chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Consensus Key Tampering] Can modification of SafetyRulesConfig on disk change the consensus private key reference, allowing an attacker to make validators use attacker-controlled keys for consensus signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Persistent Safety State Loss] If the SafetyRulesConfig save operation fails after updating in-memory state but before disk persistence, can this cause loss of safety data (last_voted_round) enabling double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Epoch Confusion] Can an attacker rollback SafetyRulesConfig to an earlier epoch's settings, causing validators to operate with stale validator set information and create chain forks?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for NodeConfig] [Network Identity Theft] Can tampering with persisted NodeConfig change the validator's network identity (PeerId), causing it to impersonate other validators and disrupt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config() for NodeConfig] [Validator Key Exposure] If NodeConfig contains or references private keys and save_config() writes with world-readable permissions, can this expose validator signing keys to local attackers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for NodeConfig] [Consensus Parameter Manipulation] Can an attacker modify NodeConfig's consensus parameters (timeout values, round durations) to cause validators to behave erratically and degrade network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for NodeConfig] [Network Address Poisoning] Can modification of NodeConfig change validator network addresses, causing the validator to connect to attacker-controlled endpoints for man-in-the-middle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config() for NodeConfig] [State Sync Manipulation] Can tampering with saved NodeConfig disable state synchronization or change trusted state sync peers, causing validators to fall behind and lose participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Insecure Permissions] Does File::create() at line 44 set appropriate file permissions (0600), or does it create world-readable SafetyRulesConfig files exposing consensus keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Umask Dependency] Does write_file() explicitly set secure permissions, or does it rely on umask which could be misconfigured, causing SafetyRulesConfig files to be created with overly permissive access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Permission Escalation] If save_config() is called with elevated privileges, can an attacker trigger config writes to protected directories, escalating filesystem access? (Medium)",
