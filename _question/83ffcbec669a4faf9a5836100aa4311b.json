  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: backing_string()] [Clone Cost] At line 78, the entire source code is cloned - for large Move files, can frequent calls to backing_string() cause excessive memory allocation and copying overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Highlight Ownership] At line 67, highlight is owned (to_owned()) while left and remainder are borrowed - is there an inconsistency that could cause lifetime or memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Invariant Violation] The file_index field should always be valid for source_code indexing - can deserialization, cloning, or concurrent modification break this invariant? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Source Map Mismatch] After construction, can the source_map, source_code, and module become desynchronized if any field is modified, causing incorrect location mappings? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Clone Safety] The Debug, Clone derives at line 18 - does cloning a ModuleViewer create deep copies of all fields, or can shared references cause aliasing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Error Propagation] At line 51, the ? operator propagates errors from get_code_location() - are these errors properly handled by callers, or can they cause tool crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Partial Failure] If get_code_location() succeeds but subsequent operations fail, can partial SourceContext objects be created with inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Initialization Failure] If any step in new() fails after source_code is populated, is cleanup performed, or does it leave partially initialized objects? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Path Validation] The source_location parameter has no validation - should it be restricted to specific directories, file extensions (.move), or canonicalized paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Module Validation] The CompiledModule parameter is passed without validation - can malformed or malicious modules cause undefined behavior in later operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [BytecodeInfo Validation] The bytecode_info parameter is not validated - can out-of-range function_index or code_offset values be provided? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Context Calculation] At lines 60-63, the context window is calculated - if loc_start < CONTEXT_SIZE, saturating_sub correctly handles it, but can context_end calculation at line 63 create overlapping or malformed context windows? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Context Size] The CONTEXT_SIZE of 1000 characters - for files with very long lines or minified code, can this expose unintended code sections or truncate important context? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Context Overlap] If multiple source locations are near each other, can overlapping context windows confuse the viewer or create ambiguous highlighting? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: ModuleViewer::new()] [Encoding Assumption] At line 30, fs::read_to_string() assumes UTF-8 encoding - can non-UTF-8 Move source files cause the read to fail or produce corrupted strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Function: source_for_code_location()] [Byte vs Char Indexing] Loc positions represent byte offsets - if source code contains multi-byte UTF-8 characters, can the byte-based indexing misalign with character boundaries in string slicing?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Unused Module Field] The module field is marked #[allow(unused)] at line 23-24 - is this field truly unnecessary, or does its presence indicate incomplete implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Field Visibility] All fields are private - can external code modify them through unsafe means or deserialization, breaking invariants? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Trait: RightScreen] [Generic Safety] The trait is generic over BytecodeViewer<'_> - can lifetime issues or type parameter mismatches cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/source_viewer.rs] [Struct: ModuleViewer] [Thread Safety] ModuleViewer has Debug and Clone derives but no Sync/Send bounds - can it be safely shared across threads in multi-threaded debugging scenarios? (Low)",
