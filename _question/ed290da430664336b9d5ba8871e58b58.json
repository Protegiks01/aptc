  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Generic Type Deserialization] Can client.get_account_resource_bcs::<ChainId>() at lines 96-99 be exploited with BCS data that doesn't match the ChainId type, causing type confusion or deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type Parameter Validation] Does the generic type parameter ChainId at line 97 get validated against the actual resource type, or can an attacker cause the wrong type to be deserialized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [BCS Type Mismatch] If the server returns BCS data for a different resource type at line 97, will deserialization as ChainId cause memory corruption or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [ChainId Value Validation] Does the deserialized ChainId at line 97 validate that the chain ID is within expected ranges, or can invalid chain IDs cause downstream logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Deserialization Memory Safety] Can the BCS deserialization at line 97 violate Rust's memory safety guarantees if the BCS data contains invalid pointers or references? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Context Chaining] All await calls use .context() - can error messages leak internal implementation details, stack traces, or file paths that aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic Unwinding] If any of the API calls panic instead of returning Err, will panic unwinding cause resource leaks or leave the client in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Timeout Handling] None of the API calls (lines 33-99) specify timeouts - can a malicious endpoint cause indefinite hangs by never sending responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Sequential Execution] All API calls are executed sequentially with .await - if one call hangs, does this block all subsequent calls causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Recovery] If an early API call fails (e.g., line 33), does the entire main() function abort, or can partial results cause inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Runtime] Does the tokio::main macro at line 21 configure appropriate thread pool sizes, or can resource exhaustion occur under load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [State Consistency] Between multiple API calls to the same account (lines 33-99), can the account state change due to concurrent transactions, causing inconsistent results across queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Request Ordering] Are the API requests guaranteed to query the same ledger version, or can each request see different blockchain states causing inconsistent data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Cancellation] If the main() function is cancelled mid-execution, can partially completed API calls cause resource leaks or dangling connections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Client Thread Safety] Is the Client instance at line 28 thread-safe for concurrent use, or does reusing it across async calls cause data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Debug Information Leakage] The debug! macro at line 26 logs full args including the URL - can this expose sensitive query parameters or authentication tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Info Log Volume] Multiple info! calls (lines 31, 37-40, 46-48, 55-57, 64-66, 75, 81-83, 90-92, 100) - can excessive logging cause disk exhaustion or performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Sensitive Data in Logs] Balance information is logged at lines 81-83 and 90-92 - in production, could this violate privacy requirements or enable financial tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Log Injection] If account addresses or resource names contained newlines or control characters, could they inject fake log entries or corrupt log files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage] The test at lines 105-109 only validates CLI argument parsing - does lack of integration tests mean vulnerabilities in API interaction go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Function: verify_tool()] [Test Execution] Can the debug_assert() at line 108 be disabled in release builds, allowing invalid configurations to pass through testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Import Dependencies] Can vulnerabilities in imported crates (anyhow, aptos_logger, aptos_rest_client, aptos_types, clap, reqwest) be exploited through this example code? (Varies)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Client Library] If the underlying Client implementation has vulnerabilities, does this example properly demonstrate secure usage patterns or propagate insecure practices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/examples/account/main.rs] [Example Code Risk] As example code that developers may copy, do insecure patterns here (hardcoded addresses, missing validation, no timeouts) propagate to production applications? (Medium)",
