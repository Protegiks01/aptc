  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Branch Name Validation] Does reset_hard() validate branch names against allowed patterns, or can special branch names like 'HEAD', 'ORIG_HEAD', or '-' cause unexpected git behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_rev()] [Input Sanitization] Can find_rev() accept any arbitrary string as 'rev', potentially allowing it to resolve unexpected refs like 'refs/remotes/origin/HEAD' that point to attacker-controlled branches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_tag()] [Wildcard Injection] Does find_tag() properly escape or validate the 'rev' parameter to prevent wildcard injection that lists all tags instead of a specific one? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Exit Status Bypass] Can a malicious git wrapper return success (exit code 0) even when clone fails, causing the system to proceed with an incomplete or corrupted repository? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Partial Failure] Does checkout() properly handle git's partial success scenarios where some files are checked out but others fail, potentially leaving the repository in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Network Failure Handling] If fetch_origin() fails due to temporary network issues, can attackers exploit retry logic to cause denial of service or inconsistent repository state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Error Propagation] Does reset_hard() properly propagate all git errors, or can certain failure modes be silently ignored, leaving the repository in a dangerous state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_rev()] [Encoding Attack] The function converts stdout to UTF-8 with error handling, but can attackers inject non-UTF-8 sequences in git output (e.g., through commit messages or tag names) to cause parsing failures or bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_tag()] [Unicode Homoglyph] Can attackers create tags with Unicode homoglyphs or zero-width characters that appear identical to legitimate tags but point to malicious commits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_rev()] [Null Byte Injection] Can null bytes in git output (embedded in branch names, tag names, or commit hashes) truncate strings and cause incorrect validation or parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_tag()] [CRLF Injection] Can attackers inject CRLF sequences in tag names to create fake multi-line output that confuses tag list parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Concurrent Clone Collision] If multiple threads simultaneously clone to the same target_path, can race conditions cause repository corruption or allow one thread to overwrite another's clone with malicious content? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Concurrent Checkout] Can concurrent checkout() calls on the same repository cause git lock file conflicts or race conditions that result in undefined repository state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Fetch Race Condition] When fetch_origin() runs concurrently with other git operations (checkout, reset), can it cause race conditions in git's object database or ref updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Reset Race Condition] If reset_hard() executes while other operations are reading from the repository, can it cause readers to see inconsistent or partially reset state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Symlink Attack] Can a malicious repository contain symbolic links that, when cloned, point outside the repository directory and expose or overwrite sensitive files on the host system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Symlink Traversal] During checkout(), can git create symbolic links that point to sensitive system locations, allowing subsequent operations to read or modify unintended files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Device File Attack] Can a malicious git repository include device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/random) that, when cloned, could be exploited for resource exhaustion or system compromise? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Hardlink Exploitation] Can attackers use hardlinks in git repositories to create multiple references to the same file content, potentially bypassing storage quotas or causing unexpected file modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Git LFS Exploitation] If the repository uses Git Large File Storage (LFS), can attackers exploit LFS to serve malicious binaries or cause excessive bandwidth/storage consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Alternates Attack] Can a malicious repository use git alternates to reference external object databases, potentially exposing sensitive data or injecting malicious objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Refspec Manipulation] Does fetch_origin() use a hardcoded refspec or can attackers manipulate what gets fetched, potentially downloading malicious refs or bypassing expected update restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Detached HEAD Risk] After reset_hard() executes, is the repository left in a detached HEAD state that could confuse subsequent operations or security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Sparse Checkout Bypass] Can attackers exploit git sparse checkout configurations to checkout only specific malicious files while hiding others, bypassing security scans? (Medium)",
