  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that exploit vulnerabilities in bcs::from_bytes() to cause memory corruption, panic, or execute arbitrary code during CoinWithdraw event deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide BCS bytes where the amount field exceeds u64::MAX during deserialization, causing integer overflow that results in incorrect withdrawal amounts being recorded in events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes with an extremely large coin_type String (e.g., gigabytes) that bypasses size limits during deserialization, causing memory exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide BCS bytes that deserialize into a valid CoinWithdraw struct but with corrupted internal state (e.g., invalid AccountAddress bytes), bypassing validation and causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Replay attack] Does try_from_bytes() validate uniqueness or include anti-replay mechanisms, or can an attacker replay the same deserialized CoinWithdraw event bytes multiple times to fake withdrawal operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] Does try_from_bytes() properly propagate all BCS deserialization errors, or can certain malformed inputs cause silent failures that result in incorrect event processing without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Validation bypass] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes that deserialize successfully but contain invalid data (e.g., zero amount, empty coin_type), bypassing upstream validation checks that should have occurred before event emission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS version mismatch] Can incompatible BCS encoding versions between nodes cause try_from_bytes() to produce different CoinWithdraw structs from the same bytes, leading to state divergence across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Integer overflow] Can the u64 amount field overflow when aggregating multiple CoinWithdraw events, potentially causing total withdrawal amounts to wrap around and show smaller values than actual withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Zero amount] Does the CoinWithdraw struct validate that amount is non-zero, or can attackers emit events with amount=0 to spam the event log, exhaust storage, and degrade indexer performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Maximum value] Can an attacker set amount to u64::MAX to create withdrawal events that appear to exceed total coin supply, potentially breaking accounting invariants in downstream systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: amount()] [Missing validation] Does the amount() getter perform any validation or sanitization, or does it blindly return the stored u64 value even if it represents an invalid withdrawal amount? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Arithmetic operations] When amount is used in arithmetic operations with other u64 values, are there proper overflow checks to prevent wraparound leading to incorrect balance calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Amount validation] Does new() validate the amount parameter, or can callers create CoinWithdraw events with arbitrary amounts including 0 or u64::MAX without any checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [String injection] Can an attacker inject malicious characters or escape sequences into the coin_type String (e.g., SQL injection patterns, XSS payloads) that exploit vulnerabilities in downstream parsers or indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Empty string] Does the CoinWithdraw struct validate that coin_type is non-empty, or can attackers create events with empty coin_type strings that break indexing logic or cause lookup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Unicode normalization] Can attackers use Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., different representations of the same coin type) to create CoinWithdraw events that bypass deduplication or matching logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Length limits] Does coin_type have a maximum length limit, or can attackers create events with multi-megabyte coin_type strings causing memory exhaustion and storage bloat? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: coin_type()] [Type tag mismatch] Can the coin_type String contain values that don't match valid Move type tags, causing type confusion when the event is processed by the Move VM or indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Case sensitivity] Is coin_type comparison case-sensitive, or can attackers create multiple events with different casing (e.g., 'APT' vs 'apt') that are treated as different coin types despite referring to the same asset? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Coin type validation] Does new() validate that coin_type follows the expected format for Move type tags, or can callers pass arbitrary strings including malformed or non-existent types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Path traversal] Can coin_type contain path traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../system') that exploit file system operations in logging or storage backends? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Control characters] Can coin_type contain control characters (e.g., null bytes, newlines) that break log parsing, CSV exports, or other text-based processing of withdrawal events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [Invalid address] Can the account field contain an invalid or malformed AccountAddress (e.g., all zeros, reserved addresses) that should be rejected but gets stored in the CoinWithdraw event? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [System address] Does CoinWithdraw validate that account is not a system-reserved address (e.g., 0x0, 0x1), or can events incorrectly claim withdrawals from protected accounts? (High)"
