  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Idempotency] Can the same description mutation be emitted multiple times for the same collection, and would this cause indexers to incorrectly count mutation frequency or bloat event storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [State divergence] Can there be divergence between the actual on-chain collection description state and the description reported in CollectionDescriptionMutate events due to failed transactions or state rollbacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Orphaned events] Can events be emitted for collections that no longer exist (were deleted or burned), causing indexers to track ghost collections that have no on-chain presence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Description length mismatch] If on-chain Move code enforces maximum description length, can the Rust event struct accept longer descriptions, causing inconsistency between event data and actual state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Creator ownership verification] Does any code verify that creator_addr actually owns the collection before processing the event, or do indexers blindly trust the event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [String allocation] Can the String fields cause heap fragmentation or excessive allocations if events with varying string sizes are processed rapidly, degrading validator performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Clone overhead] Does the lack of Clone implementation mean events cannot be efficiently duplicated, or if Clone is derived elsewhere, could deep cloning large descriptions cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Drop behavior] Are there any custom Drop implementations that could panic or leak resources, potentially causing validator crashes during event cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [All functions] [Unsafe code audit] Does the file or its dependencies use any unsafe Rust code that could violate memory safety, enabling exploits like buffer overflows or arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Interior mutability] Could interior mutability patterns (Cell, RefCell) if added to fields allow mutation of supposedly immutable event data, breaking invariants expected by downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Type system] [Cross-module confusion] Can a malicious module define its own CollectionDescriptionMutate type that is binary-compatible but semantically different, causing type confusion when events cross module boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Event processing] [Indexer desync] Can subtle differences in how different indexers deserialize or interpret CollectionDescriptionMutate events cause them to compute different collection states, leading to inconsistent data across the ecosystem? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [API exposure] If events are exposed via REST APIs, can response injection attacks exploit insufficient escaping of collection_name or description strings in JSON responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Move interop] [Module migration issues] When module_event_migration_enabled() changes from false to true in the Move code, can events emitted during the transition period cause processing errors due to format mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Quadratic deserialization] Could the BCS deserialization have quadratic complexity if string fields contain repeated patterns, enabling a gas-efficient attack that causes expensive CPU time on validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Storage amplification] Can an attacker emit many CollectionDescriptionMutate events with incrementally different descriptions to cause unbounded growth in event storage, filling up validator disk space? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Event size] [Network bandwidth] Can extremely large events (multi-MB descriptions) consume excessive bandwidth during block propagation, slowing down consensus or causing validator desyncs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Debug trait] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information from description fields that should be redacted in production logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Default values] If a Default implementation exists, could it create events with invalid zero-initialized values that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Equality comparison] Is there a PartialEq implementation, and if so, does it correctly handle Unicode normalization or string comparison edge cases that could cause logical bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Hash implementation] If the struct implements Hash, does it produce consistent hashes across different Rust versions and platforms for use in HashMap-based indexing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply chain attacks] Could compromised dependencies (bcs, serde, move_core_types) inject malicious code into event deserialization or processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Concurrent modification] If events are stored in shared data structures, could race conditions during concurrent access cause events to be corrupted or processed out of order? (High)"
