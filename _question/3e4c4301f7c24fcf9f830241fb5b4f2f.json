  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPoolShare] [Integer Overflow] Can the 'value' field (u64) overflow during deserialization when accumulating shares from multiple reward distributions, potentially causing share calculation errors that lead to fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPoolShare] [Deserialization Attack] Does deserialization validate that 'key' (AccountAddress) is not a reserved system address (0x0, 0x1, etc.), or can attackers inject system addresses as shareholders to bypass access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPoolShare] [Zero Value Attack] Can 'value' be deserialized as zero, allowing attackers to create dummy shareholders that dilute reward distributions without contributing stake? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPoolShare] [Duplicate Keys] Since 'key' is not unique-constrained in the struct definition, can an attacker create multiple DistributionPoolShare entries with the same AccountAddress to claim rewards multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Integer Overflow] Can 'total_coins' or 'total_shares' (both u64) overflow during reward accumulation, causing the share-to-coin ratio calculation to wrap around and enable fund extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Invariant Violation] Does deserialization validate that total_shares equals the sum of all shares in the 'shares' vector, or can attackers inject inconsistent state causing share miscalculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Invariant Violation] Is there validation that the number of entries in 'shares' vector matches the number in 'shareholders' vector, or can mismatched lengths cause index-out-of-bounds panics or logic errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Limit Bypass] Can 'shareholders_limit' be set to u64::MAX during deserialization, effectively removing the shareholder cap and allowing unlimited dilution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Limit Bypass] Does deserialization verify that the length of 'shares' and 'shareholders' vectors does not exceed 'shareholders_limit', or can attackers bypass this constraint by injecting pre-filled vectors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Scaling Factor Attack] Can 'scaling_factor' be deserialized as zero, causing division-by-zero errors in share-to-coin calculations that crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Scaling Factor Manipulation] Can 'scaling_factor' be set to 1 or an extremely small value during deserialization, reducing calculation precision and allowing attackers to steal fractional amounts through rounding errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Scaling Factor Manipulation] Can 'scaling_factor' be set to u64::MAX, causing multiplication overflows in share conversions that wrap around and produce incorrect reward amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Vector Consistency] Are 'shares' and 'shareholders' vectors required to have matching AccountAddress keys at corresponding indices, or can attackers inject mismatched entries causing rewards to be sent to wrong addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Empty State Attack] Can all fields be deserialized with zero/empty values (total_coins=0, total_shares=0, empty vectors), creating an invalid pool state that causes panics in division operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Duplicate Shareholders] Does the 'shareholders' vector enforce uniqueness, or can the same AccountAddress appear multiple times, allowing double-claiming of rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Vector Memory DoS] Can the 'shares' or 'shareholders' vectors be deserialized with extremely large lengths (e.g., billions of entries) causing memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Ratio Manipulation] Can 'total_coins' be set much higher than 'total_shares' during deserialization, artificially inflating the value-per-share and allowing instant reward extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: DistributionPool] [Underflow Attack] If 'total_shares' > 0 but 'total_coins' = 0, can reward distribution calculations underflow when computing share values, leading to state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Integer Overflow] Can 'principal' (u64) overflow when accumulating multiple stakes, causing the recorded principal to wrap around and show artificially low values for withdrawal calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Commission Overflow] Can 'commission_percentage' exceed 100 (or the intended maximum like 10000 for basis points), allowing operators to claim more than 100% of rewards and drain the pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Commission Validation] Does deserialization validate that 'commission_percentage' is within valid bounds, or can attackers inject values like u64::MAX causing integer overflow in commission calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Pool Address Collision] Can 'pool_address' be deserialized as a system-reserved address or duplicate pool address, causing staking operations to target the wrong pool and enabling fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Owner Capability Hijacking] Is the 'owner_cap' AccountAddress validated during deserialization to ensure it matches the expected owner, or can attackers inject arbitrary addresses to take control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Signer Capability Leak] Can 'signer_cap' be deserialized as an attacker-controlled address, allowing unauthorized signing of transactions on behalf of the staking contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Struct: StakingContract] [Principal Underflow] If withdrawals are calculated based on 'principal', can the principal be set to zero during deserialization while distribution_pool.total_coins is non-zero, causing incorrect reward calculations? (High)"
