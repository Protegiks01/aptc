  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Partial result handling] If the first query at line 73 succeeds but subsequent iterations fail, the function returns Ok(()) at line 91 - can this incomplete success mask database degradation or corruption that should trigger alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Validation race condition] The latest_version check at lines 54-57 and the subsequent comparison at line 59 are not atomic - can the database version change between these operations, causing inconsistent validation results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [No authentication] The entire Cmd struct has no authentication or authorization fields - can any user with access to the binary query arbitrary state keys including sensitive validator configuration, private stake amounts, or governance voting records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Privileged resource access] At line 50, StateKey::resource() can create keys for any address and struct_tag - can an attacker use this to read system resources at 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, or 0x4 addresses that store framework code, validator configurations, or treasury funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Governance data exposure] Can an attacker use this tool to query aptos_governance::GovernanceProposal or voting::VotingForum resources to see pending proposals, vote tallies, or delegations before they are finalized, enabling front-running attacks on governance decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Validator stake disclosure] Can this tool be used to query stake::StakePool resources for all validators, revealing exact stake amounts, pending rewards, and commission rates that could be used to identify vulnerable validators or plan stake-grinding attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Account enumeration] By iterating through sequential addresses and common struct_tags, can an attacker enumerate all accounts with coin balances (coin::CoinStore), enabling targeted attacks on high-value accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [BCS deserialization bypass] The commented code at lines 37-38 shows bcs::from_bytes() for key_vec - if this is re-enabled, can an attacker supply malformed BCS-encoded data that deserializes to an unexpected StateKey type, bypassing resource access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Value bytes interpretation] At line 100, value.bytes() are printed as raw debug output - if these bytes contain control characters or escape sequences, can they inject malicious commands into terminal output or log files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [StructTag parsing ambiguity] At line 49, StructTag::from_str() parses user input - can an attacker craft ambiguous struct tag strings like '0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin' (missing closing >) that parse incorrectly but still create valid StateKeys pointing to wrong resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Metadata type confusion] At line 102, value.into_metadata() consumes the value - does this prevent proper cleanup of the StateValue, and can metadata from different resource types be confused if printed in rapid succession? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Incomplete feature] Lines 36-46 contain commented-out code for key_hex parameter - does this indicate an unfinished implementation that could be exploited if partially enabled, allowing direct state key specification that bypasses address/struct_tag validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Dead code vulnerability] The key_hex Option field at line 22 is never checked - if future code assumes key_hex is validated when present, could this lead to unvalidated database queries when the field is populated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Hex decode attack] The commented hex::decode() at line 37 operates on untrusted input - if re-enabled, can malformed hex strings cause panics, infinite loops, or memory corruption in the hex decoding library? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Sharding bypass] The StateKey created at line 50 is used to query the database at line 73 - does this respect the sharding configuration from db_dir, or can crafted StateKeys access wrong shards and read inconsistent or corrupted data?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Schema version mismatch] Are the opened databases (lines 52-53) validated to have compatible schema versions, or can an attacker point db_dir to an old database with different schema causing incorrect state interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Cross-shard inconsistency] When get_state_value_with_version_by_version() is called at line 73, does it guarantee atomic reads across shards if the StateKey has been moved between shards due to reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] The latest_version check at line 56 and the subsequent query loop starting at line 72 are not atomic - can the ledger advance between these operations, causing queries at versions that are now committed but weren't when the check passed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Database lock timing] If this tool is run during an epoch change when validator sets are being updated, can the database reads at line 73 observe partial state updates where some validator configs are new and others are old?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Iterator invalidation] The get_state_value_with_version_by_version() method creates iterators in the underlying database - if the database is pruned during the 10-iteration loop, can iterators become invalid causing crashes or incorrect results?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Warning bypass] The warning message at lines 60-67 uses red formatting but doesn't prevent execution - can an attacker deliberately trigger this warning while querying future versions to probe for uncommitted state or pending transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Terminal escape injection] The colored output using .yellow() and .red() may contain ANSI escape codes - can these be used to hide command execution, manipulate terminal state, or cause visual spoofing in security-sensitive contexts?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Debug format exposure] At line 100 and 102, {:?} debug formatting is used - can this expose internal memory addresses, Arc reference counts, or other implementation details that aid in exploit development?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Future version query] When self.version > latest_version at line 59, execution continues with a warning - can this access uncommitted state in the write buffer or speculative execution cache, leaking transaction details before consensus?
