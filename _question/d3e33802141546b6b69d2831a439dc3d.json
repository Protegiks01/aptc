  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Asymmetric Message Delivery] Can Byzantine validators selectively timeout self-messages to create asymmetric views where some validators see JWK updates while others don't? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkTask::start()] [Channel Backpressure] When rpc_tx channel is full, messages are dropped with only a warning - can this cause validators to have inconsistent message histories? (High)",
