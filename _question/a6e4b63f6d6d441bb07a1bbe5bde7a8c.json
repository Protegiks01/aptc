  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker specify a malicious path using '../' sequences in the --path argument to write session data outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Path Traversal] Does the path validation in Init prevent absolute paths (e.g., '/etc/aptos/session') that could allow an attacker to initialize sessions in privileged system directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Path Injection] Can an attacker use symbolic links in the path argument to redirect session data writes to sensitive locations, bypassing any path validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Directory Traversal] Is there validation that the path directory doesn't already exist with sensitive data, or can an attacker overwrite existing critical session data by re-initializing with the same path? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Race Condition] If multiple Init commands are executed concurrently with the same path, can race conditions in Session::init() or Session::init_with_remote_state() lead to corrupted session data or inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Network Spoofing] Can an attacker manipulate the network parameter to point to a malicious fullnode endpoint, causing the simulation to fork from a compromised or fake network state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker specify an arbitrarily high network_version value to cause integer overflow in Session::init_with_remote_state(), potentially leading to incorrect state initialization or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Version Manipulation] If network_version is set to 0 or a very old version, can this cause the simulation to initialize with invalid or genesis state that doesn't match current protocol rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [TOCTOU] Between fetching the latest ledger version (line 54) and initializing the session (line 60), can the network state change, leading to time-of-check-time-of-use issues where the forked state is inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Network Connection] Does the Client::builder() properly validate TLS certificates when connecting to the remote network, or can an attacker perform MITM attacks to inject malicious state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [API Key Leak] Is the api_key parameter properly sanitized in error messages and logs, or can it be leaked through verbose error output when Session::init_with_remote_state() fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [API Key Injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or malicious payloads in the api_key parameter that could be interpreted as HTTP headers or cause injection attacks in the REST client? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [URL Validation] Does network.to_base_url() properly validate the URL format, or can an attacker inject malicious URL schemes (file://, data://) to access local resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker specify a very large network_version causing Session::init_with_remote_state() to download and process excessive state data, leading to disk space exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Error Handling] If get_ledger_information() fails due to network errors, are error messages properly sanitized to avoid leaking sensitive information about the network topology or internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [State Corruption] If Session::init() or Session::init_with_remote_state() partially completes before failing, can this leave corrupted session files that could be exploited by subsequent commands? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Privilege Escalation] Can an attacker initialize a session with elevated privileges by forking from a network state where their account has admin permissions, then use that in local simulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Init::execute()] [Genesis Manipulation] When initializing without network parameter (line 63), does Session::init() properly apply the correct genesis configuration, or can local genesis files be manipulated to create invalid initial state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker specify u64::MAX or very large values for the amount parameter, causing integer overflow in session.fund_account() leading to incorrect balance updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Unlimited Minting] Does fund_account() enforce any maximum funding limits, or can an attacker fund accounts with arbitrary amounts exceeding total APT supply, breaking economic invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Balance Overflow] If an account already has a large balance, can funding it with additional APT cause the total balance to overflow u64, resulting in a wrapped-around small balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/sim.rs] [Function: Fund::execute()] [Zero Amount] Can an attacker call fund with amount=0 to trigger edge case bugs in fund_account() or leave audit trails that could be used to hide malicious funding operations? (Low)",
