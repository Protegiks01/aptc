  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/table-natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_new_table_handle()] [Cryptographic collision] Can an attacker craft transactions to force Sha3_256 hash collisions in table handle generation by manipulating session_hash or table count, allowing them to overwrite existing tables and cause permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/table-natives/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_new_table_handle()] [Determinism violation] Are all validators guaranteed to produce identical table handles for the same transaction, or can non-deterministic behavior in session_hash generation cause state divergence leading to network partition?
