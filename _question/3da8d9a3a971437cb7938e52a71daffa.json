  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Deterministic Execution] Does the entire process() function guarantee deterministic execution across all validators, including error conditions, to ensure consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [State Root Verification] After computing all blocks, is there verification that the final state root matches expected value, or can execution produce incorrect state roots silently? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Transaction Ordering] Does execution preserve transaction ordering within blocks and across blocks in the batch, or can reordering lead to different state outcomes on different validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Nonce/Sequence Verification] Does compute() verify transaction sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks, or is this validation assumed to happen elsewhere creating bypass risk? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Resource Leak] If execution fails at line 78-83, are there resource leaks (memory, file handles, locks) from partial execution that accumulate over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionPhase] [Drop Implementation] Is there a Drop implementation to clean up execution_proxy resources, or can abrupt validator shutdown leave executor in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Result Vector Cleanup] If error occurs mid-loop (line 78), is the partially filled result vector properly dropped, or can this cause memory leak? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionPhase] [Arc Reference Counting] The execution_proxy uses Arc (line 43) - can reference cycles prevent garbage collection, causing memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Type: ExecutedBlock] [Type Safety] ExecutedBlock is imported from aptos_consensus_types - does this type enforce invariants (signatures, validity), or can malformed ExecutedBlock instances bypass safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Type: ExecutorResult] [Result Handling] ExecutorResult is used (line 39, 8) - does exhaustive pattern matching on all error variants occur, or can unexpected errors cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Lifetime Safety] Are there lifetime issues where references in ExecutionRequest/Response outlive their referents, causing use-after-free? (Medium)"
