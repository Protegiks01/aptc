  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/coordinators/replay_verify.rs] [Data Validation] [Version Continuity] Are there gaps in transaction versions checked during backup selection, or could missing transaction versions cause discontinuities in the restored state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/coordinators/replay_verify.rs] [Data Validation] [Restore Handler DB Path] Does restore_handler enforce that the target database path is within expected boundaries, or can it write to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/coordinators/replay_verify.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero-Length Replay] If start_version equals end_version, does the version validation at line 111 properly reject this, or could zero-length replay pass and skip verification entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/coordinators/replay_verify.rs] [Edge Case] [Genesis Replay] If both start_version and next_txn_version are 0, does snapshot restoration work correctly, or are there assumptions about having a non-zero genesis snapshot? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/coordinators/replay_verify.rs] [Edge Case] [Snapshot at End Version] If a snapshot exists exactly at end_version, does the logic at line 133-140 handle this correctly, or could it cause off-by-one errors in transaction selection? (Low)"
