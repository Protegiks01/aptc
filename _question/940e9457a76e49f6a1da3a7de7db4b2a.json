  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState] [ABA problem] Can ConsensusState cycle through NotStarted->InProgress->Finished->NotStarted so quickly that observers miss state changes, breaking synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Derive: Clone on JWKConsensusMsg] [Deep clone cost] Does cloning JWKConsensusMsg perform deep copies of ProviderJWKs data, and can attackers exploit expensive clones to cause CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
