  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Native registration] Can an attacker manipulate the move_std_addr parameter during native function registration to register malicious natives under the wrong address, potentially bypassing Move's type system and access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type confusion] Does the native registration process verify that the AccountAddress provided matches the expected Move stdlib address, or could a mismatch cause type confusion when Move code calls these natives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Macro: add_natives!] [Name collision] Can duplicate function names across different modules in the add_natives! macro cause function shadowing or replacement, allowing one native to overwrite another and break critical functionality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Gas charging bypass] The with_incremental_gas_charging(false) disables incremental charging for all stdlib natives - can attackers exploit this to perform expensive operations without proper gas accounting, leading to DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Module ordering] Does the order of add_natives! macro invocations matter for security, and could reordering allow later modules to override earlier ones in the native function table? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Feature flag bypass] The unit_test module is conditionally included with cfg(feature = \\",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: make_table_from_iter()] [Table construction] Can the make_table_from_iter function fail silently or produce an incomplete native function table, causing some natives to be unavailable and breaking Move contracts that depend on them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [BCS serialization] In the bcs::make_all registration, can malicious Move code trigger NFE_BCS_SERIALIZATION_FAILURE aborts in native_to_bytes to leak information about internal VM state or bypass gas charging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Deep copy overhead] The native_to_bytes function performs deep copies when reading references - can attackers craft deeply nested structures to cause excessive memory allocation and OOM conditions despite gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Type layout DoS] Can an attacker pass types with extremely large or deeply nested layouts to native_to_bytes, causing the type_to_type_layout call to consume excessive gas or fail with dependency limit errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Gas estimation bypass] The native_serialized_size function charges based on serialized output size - can attackers exploit discrepancies between estimated and actual serialization cost to perform under-priced operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Lazy loading exploit] When lazy loading is enabled, errors in type layout construction are propagated directly without remapping - can this expose internal VM errors or state that should remain hidden? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Serialization inconsistency] Can different nodes produce different BCS serializations for the same Move value due to non-deterministic behavior in ValueSerDeContext, breaking consensus on state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Legacy signer handling] The with_legacy_signer() mode in serialization - can enabling/disabling this cause consensus splits between nodes running different configurations? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Enum variant handling] Does constant_serialized_size correctly handle all enum variants (RuntimeVariants, WithVariants) or could malformed enums return incorrect sizes leading to buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Native type wrapping] The MoveTypeLayout::Native(_, inner) case unwraps and recursively processes inner types - can malicious native types cause type confusion or bypass safety checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Vector size attacks] Vectors have no constant size - can attackers exploit this to create values that report small constant sizes but expand dramatically during actual serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Signer size leak] The comment says 'signer's size is VM implementation detail and can change at will' - can this variability cause consensus issues or be exploited to fingerprint VM versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Option encoding mismatch] The create_option_u64 function uses different encodings based on enum_option_enabled flag - can this flag mismatch between validators cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Failure cost bypass] When serialization fails, BCS_TO_BYTES_FAILURE cost is charged - is this sufficient to prevent repeated failed serialization attempts from being a DoS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: bcs] [Max nesting depth] ValueSerDeContext is initialized with max_value_nest_depth - can attackers craft values that stay just under this limit but still cause performance issues? (Low)",

(Critical)",
