  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Trait: KVStorage backup] If KVStorage is backed up, are private keys properly protected in backups, or can backup compromise leak all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Error: KeyNotSet vs KeyVersionNotFound] Can confusion between KeyNotSet and KeyVersionNotFound errors cause incorrect fallback behavior in key lookup logic? (Medium)",
