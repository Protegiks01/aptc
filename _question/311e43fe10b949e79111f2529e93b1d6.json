  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ConsensusAlgorithmConfig] [DAG to Jolteon downgrade] Does switching from DAG back to Jolteon consensus cause state corruption, as DAG-specific state (causal history) becomes invalid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ConsensusAlgorithmConfig] [Quorum store toggle attack] Can rapidly toggling quorum_store_enabled via governance cause validators to desynchronize on transaction batching, leading to block validation disagreements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ConsensusAlgorithmConfig] [Order vote toggle attack] Can toggling order_vote_enabled mid-epoch cause some validators to enforce vote ordering while others don't, breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Active vs inactive weight gaming] Can validators exploit the active_weight/inactive_weight distinction by alternating between active and inactive states to maintain unfairly high election probability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Failed weight exploitation] If failed_weight is too high, can recently-failed validators still get elected frequently enough to continue Byzantine attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Reputation window manipulation] Can the proposer_window (10x validators) vs voter_window (1x validators) ratio be exploited to make proposer reputation less responsive to recent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Historical epoch poisoning] Can use_history_from_previous_epoch_max_count=5 allow long-term reputation manipulation across epoch boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: enable_validator_txns()] [Config mutation atomicity] Is the std::mem::take() and reassignment pattern in enable_validator_txns() atomic, or can concurrent reads see intermediate states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: disable_validator_txns()] [Concurrent disable/enable] Can concurrent calls to disable_validator_txns() and enable_validator_txns() race, causing vtxn config to end up in unexpected states? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [All mutation functions] [No synchronization] Do config mutation methods (enable_validator_txns, disable_validator_txns, disable_rand_check) lack synchronization primitives, allowing data races if called concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Entire file] [Malicious governance config] Can malicious governance proposals (with <1/3 stake but >50% voting power during low participation) push through consensus configs that break safety, such as extreme weights or invalid windows? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Entire file] [Config validation absence] Does the file contain any validation logic for config parameters, or can governance set arbitrary values that violate invariants (e.g., all weights=0, window_size=0)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Governance bypass] Can attackers bypass normal governance by directly modifying the on-chain Move resource if they gain access, since deserialization doesn't validate config correctness?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: active_weight] [Weight multiplication overflow] If active_weight=u64::MAX and it gets multiplied by large voting power values, can this overflow and wrap to small weights, inverting election probabilities? (High)",
