  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Type parameter K] [Generic misuse] Can different instantiations of MockTreeStore<K> with incompatible K types be mixed, causing type confusion and incorrect node decoding? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Type parameter K] [Phantom data] Does Node<K> properly use PhantomData<K> if K is not stored directly, or can incorrect variance annotations break type safety? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Mock usage] [Production deployment] Can MockTreeStore accidentally be used in production instead of the real StateMerkleDb, disabling critical persistence and causing total data loss on restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Mock usage] [Test assumptions] Do tests relying on MockTreeStore make assumptions about ordering or behavior that don't hold in the production StateMerkleDb, hiding bugs until deployment? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Mock usage] [Performance mismatch] Does MockTreeStore's in-memory HashMap have vastly different performance characteristics than production storage, causing tests to pass but production to fail under load? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Mock usage] [Missing features] Does MockTreeStore implement all TreeReader/TreeWriter methods that production code uses, or can missing methods cause runtime errors when switching from mock to production? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Empty tree] Can operations on an empty MockTreeStore (no nodes) cause panics or undefined behavior in get_rightmost_leaf() or purge_stale_nodes()? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Single node] Does storing a single root node work correctly, or can edge cases in get_rightmost_leaf() fail when there's only one leaf? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Version 0] Can version 0 nodes be stored correctly, or do zero-version edge cases cause off-by-one errors in version comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Max version] Can Version::MAX nodes be stored and pruned correctly, or does version overflow cause arithmetic errors in stale_since_version calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Empty batch] Can write_node_batch() and write_tree_update_batch() handle empty batches gracefully, or do empty iterators cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Edge case] [Identical nodes] Can two nodes with identical content but different NodeKeys be stored, or does HashMap equality checking incorrectly deduplicate them? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Integration] [TreeReader trait] Does get_node_option() fully implement the TreeReader contract expected by JellyfishMerkleTree, or can missing guarantees break Merkle tree operations? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Integration] [TreeWriter trait] Does write_node_batch() provide the atomicity guarantees that TreeWriter consumers expect, or can partial failures violate those contracts? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Integration] [NodeBatch type] Is NodeBatch just a type alias for HashMap, or does it have additional structure that MockTreeStore doesn't validate? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Integration] [Version semantics] Does MockTreeStore's version handling match the semantics expected by the Merkle tree library, particularly for versioned queries and proofs? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Concurrency] [Read lock starvation] Can continuous write operations in write_node_batch() starve readers in get_node_option(), preventing Merkle proof generation and causing API timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Concurrency] [Write lock fairness] Does RwLock guarantee fair lock acquisition, or can a malicious thread repeatedly acquire write locks, blocking all other operations indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/mock_tree_store.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock upgrade deadlock] Can attempts to upgrade from read to write lock (even if not directly in the code) cause deadlocks in surrounding code that uses MockTreeStore? (Low)",
