  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: get_secret_a()] [Reference aliasing] Can multiple threads hold references from get_secret_a() simultaneously while another thread mutates the InputSecret through AddAssign, creating aliasing violations that invoke undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Atomic operations missing] Should InputSecret operations be atomic to prevent partial reads/writes in concurrent scenarios, or can non-atomic scalar field access cause torn reads where half of the 256-bit scalar is from one value and half from another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add()] [TOCTOU in addition] In Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use scenarios, if a zero check (is_zero()) happens before an addition, can the InputSecret be modified between check and use, invalidating the zero assumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory ordering] On architectures with weak memory models (ARM, PowerPC), can reordering of scalar field reads/writes cause different threads to see inconsistent InputSecret values during PVSS dealing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Type confusion] Can an InputSecret be confused with other scalar-wrapping types (e.g., DealtSecretKey, private keys) in the codebase, leading to secrets being used in wrong contexts that break security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: get_secret_a()] [Invariant violation] Does exposing the raw Scalar through get_secret_a() allow callers to violate InputSecret's intended invariants, such as using the scalar in non-PVSS contexts where different security properties are expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Add] [Mixed type addition] Can InputSecrets be accidentally added to other Scalar-based types through trait overlap, causing type confusion where PVSS input secrets are mixed with unrelated cryptographic values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Newtype bypass] Can the newtype pattern be bypassed through unsafe code or pattern matching to directly access the scalar field 'a', circumventing the type-based security wrapper? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Uniform] [Wrong RNG type] Can callers pass an RNG that doesn't properly implement CryptoRng (e.g., a deterministic test RNG) in production code, generating predictable InputSecrets due to type system limitations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Field element properties] Does the InputSecret properly maintain scalar field properties (closure under addition, valid field elements), or can operations produce invalid scalars that break BLS12-381 cryptography? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Subgroup confinement] While scalars don't have subgroup issues, can the InputSecret be used to generate group elements that land in small subgroups, breaking cryptographic assumptions in PVSS? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: generate()] [Grinding attack] Can a malicious validator repeatedly generate InputSecrets until finding one with special properties (low Hamming weight, specific bit patterns) that makes subsequent PVSS attacks easier? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Verifiable random function] If InputSecrets should be generated using a VRF for verifiability, does the current implementation lack this, allowing validators to cherry-pick favorable secrets? (High)",
