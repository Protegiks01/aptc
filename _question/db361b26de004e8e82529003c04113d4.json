  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Voting Power Overflow] Can an attacker provide a voting_power value near u64::MAX that causes integer overflow when added to existing votes, potentially manipulating vote totals to pass or fail proposals maliciously? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Excessive Voting Power] Does the function validate that voting_power doesn't exceed the stake pool's actual available voting power, or can an attacker vote with more power than they possess to manipulate proposal outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Zero Voting Power] Can an attacker submit votes with voting_power=0 to spam the voting system, create transaction load, or manipulate vote counting logic that doesn't properly handle zero-power votes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Negative Voting Power] While voting_power is u64 (unsigned), can an attacker exploit BCS serialization or type confusion to inject negative values that underflow vote counts and manipulate totals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Voting Power Precision Loss] If voting_power calculations involve division or percentage computations, can rounding errors or precision loss be exploited to accumulate voting power beyond what stakeholders actually possess? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Invalid Proposal ID] Does the function validate that proposal_id corresponds to an active, pending proposal, or can an attacker vote on non-existent, expired, or already-executed proposals causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Proposal ID Overflow] Can an attacker provide proposal_id values near u64::MAX to exploit overflow in proposal storage indexing, causing votes to be applied to wrong proposals or corrupt governance state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Future Proposal Voting] Can an attacker preemptively vote on proposal IDs that haven't been created yet, allowing them to frontrun proposal creation and manipulate voting outcomes before legitimate voters can participate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Proposal ID Zero] Is proposal_id=0 properly handled as valid/invalid, or can special handling of zero values be exploited to bypass voting restrictions or target system governance proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Cross-Proposal Vote Bleeding] If multiple proposals exist simultaneously, can an attacker exploit weak proposal_id validation to apply votes intended for one proposal to a different proposal, manipulating multiple governance decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Multiple Partial Votes] Can an attacker call partial_vote() multiple times with the same stake_pool for the same proposal_id to cast more votes than their total voting power allows, effectively voting multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Vote Power Depletion Bypass] Does the underlying Move function properly track and decrement remaining voting power after each partial vote, or can an attacker vote repeatedly without power depletion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Cross-Account Vote Stacking] Can an attacker use different account addresses but the same stake_pool to circumvent single-stake-pool voting limits and cast multiple votes on the same proposal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Vote Delegation Exploitation] If voting power can be delegated, can an attacker exploit delegation mechanisms to vote with the same underlying stake through multiple delegates, effectively multiplying their voting power? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Concurrent Vote Race Condition] If two partial_vote transactions are submitted concurrently for the same stake_pool and proposal_id, can race conditions allow both to succeed before voting power depletion is recorded, enabling double-voting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Vote Flip Attack] Can an attacker first vote with should_pass=true, then call partial_vote again with should_pass=false (or vice versa) to flip their vote and manipulate proposal outcomes near voting deadlines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Contradictory Partial Votes] If partial voting allows splitting voting power, can an attacker vote both 'yes' (should_pass=true) and 'no' (should_pass=false) with the same stake pool to hedge their position or exploit vote counting logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Boolean Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit BCS serialization or type confusion to inject should_pass values that are neither true nor false, causing undefined voting behavior or vote counting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Vote Timing Manipulation] Can an attacker delay vote submission until just before voting deadline, then rapidly submit multiple partial votes exploiting lack of rate limiting to overwhelm the system and manipulate last-minute outcomes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Unauthorized Stake Pool Voting] Does the function verify that the account parameter has authority to vote on behalf of stake_pool, or can any account vote using any stake pool's voting power without authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Stolen Stake Pool Voting] If stake pool ownership changes (through delegation or transfer), can the previous owner still cast votes using that pool's power, leading to unauthorized voting and double-counting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Slashed Validator Voting] Can validators who have been slashed or removed from the active set still participate in voting using their stake_pool, potentially manipulating governance despite being penalized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: partial_vote()] [Account Signature Validation] Is the account parameter's cryptographic signature properly verified before allowing votes, or can unsigned or improperly signed transactions be submitted to cast fraudulent votes?
