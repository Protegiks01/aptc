  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/mod.rs] [Trait: Transport] [Memory safety] [Drop safety] Are there Drop implementations in the trait's associated types that could be exploited to cause use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/mod.rs] [Trait: TransportExt] [Type safety] [where Self: Sized bypass] Can the where Self: Sized bound on trait methods be bypassed using trait objects to create type confusion or memory safety issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/mod.rs] [Trait: Transport] [Type safety] [Pin safety] Are pinned types used correctly in implementations, or can pin projections be misused to create memory unsafety in self-referential futures? (Medium)"
