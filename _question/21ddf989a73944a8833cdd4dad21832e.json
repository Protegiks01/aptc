  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Credential exposure] At line 120, Client::new() likely uses ambient credentials - can these be extracted through memory dumps, logs, or error messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_raw_file()] [Bucket enumeration] Error handling at lines 174-185 may reveal bucket existence - can an attacker enumerate valid bucket names by triggering specific error patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Write permission abuse] At lines 103-112, the checker has write permission to new_bucket_name - can an attacker exploit this to overwrite or delete transaction files, not just progress files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Struct: Processor] [Bucket name injection] At lines 29-31, bucket names are stored as strings without validation - can SQL injection, command injection, or SSRF payloads be injected through these names? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Content-Type confusion] At line 109, progress file is uploaded with 'application/json' content type - can an attacker exploit content-type mismatches to cause parsing errors or security bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Stale progress file] If progress file updates fail silently (network issues), can the checker continue incrementing versions without persisting state, causing massive verification gaps after restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Partial progress persistence] At line 94, version is incremented before progress file update - if update fails, can this cause the same file to be checked multiple times or skipped on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [State initialization race] Between downloading progress file (lines 142-149) and validating chain_id (lines 151-156), can an attacker modify the progress file to pass validation with wrong version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Version drift] If the checker is stopped and restarted frequently, can the 180-second progress update interval (line 23) cause significant version drift between actual progress and persisted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Log injection] At lines 67-70, file_name and bucket_name are logged directly - can attackers inject malicious payloads into these fields to manipulate logs or obscure attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Information disclosure] At line 81, the full file_name is logged in error messages - can this reveal internal versioning schemes or storage patterns to attackers? (Low)",
