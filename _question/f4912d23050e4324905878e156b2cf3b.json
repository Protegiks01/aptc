  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Delayed Field Race Condition] delayed_field_optimization_enabled is false by default but enabled per-use. Can race conditions where some parallel executions have it enabled and others don't cause non-deterministic aggregator state updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: get_paranoid_type_checks()] [OnceCell Poisoning] PARANOID_TYPE_CHECKS uses OnceCell::set().ok().

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: get_async_runtime_checks()] [Async Check Bypass] If ASYNC_RUNTIME_CHECKS is true, checks may be deferred to post-commit.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_deserializer_config()] [Identifier Size DoS] max_identifier_size from features controls identifier length.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_verifier_config()] [Type Nodes Limit Change] max_type_nodes changes from Some(256) to Some(128) when enable_function_values is true. Can the stricter limit break existing modules during feature flag activation, causing transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Value Depth Assertion Bypass] The assertion at line 235 checks max_value_nest_depth equals DEFAULT_MAX_VM_VALUE_NESTED_DEPTH. Can this assertion be violated through config manipulation to cause panic and validator crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Lazy Loading Race] enable_lazy_loading is controlled by features.is_lazy_loading_enabled(). Can partial module loading create race conditions where some executions see incomplete module state, breaking determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: RandomnessConfig::fetch()] [Randomness Deposit Bypass] randomness_api_v0_required_deposit uses default_if_missing() fallback. Can attackers exploit the default value during config absence to call randomness APIs without required deposits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: RandomnessConfig::fetch()] [Custom Max Gas Exploitation] allow_rand_contract_custom_max_gas flag controls whether contracts can set custom gas limits. Can enabling this allow contracts to set extremely high limits and DoS validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [Groth16 Verification Key Bypass] Groth16VerificationKey::fetch_keyless_config() returns Option and can fail parsing. If None, are all keyless transactions properly rejected, or can they proceed without cryptographic verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [Keyless Config Deserialization Attack] Configuration::fetch_keyless_config() deserializes on-chain config.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [PreparedVerifyingKey Conversion Failure] vk.try_into() can fail when converting to PreparedVerifyingKey. Does silent failure (returns None) allow keyless transactions to proceed without verification in edge cases? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: AptosEnvironment::keyless_pvk()] [Race Condition on PVK Access] Multiple threads may call keyless_pvk() concurrently.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [Keyless Configuration TOCTOU] Configuration and VerificationKey are fetched separately from state_view.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [SHA3-256 State Corruption] The sha3_256 hasher is incrementally updated with multiple configs.

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: AptosEnvironment::eq()] [Hash-Only Equality Vulnerability] PartialEq only compares hash values.
