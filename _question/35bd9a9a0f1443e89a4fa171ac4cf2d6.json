(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Function: verify_arbitrary_msg()] [Length validation] Does verify_arbitrary_msg validate message length, or can an attacker supply extremely long messages causing DoS through excessive verification time or memory exhaustion in validators?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Function: batch_verify()] [Default implementation weakness] At line 287-295, does the default batch_verify iterate without early exit, or can timing differences leak information about which signature failed, helping attackers identify valid vs invalid signature patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Function: batch_verify()] [Error propagation] Does the ?operator at line 292 properly propagate all verification failures, or can some errors be silently ignored allowing partially-valid batches to pass verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Function: batch_verify()] [Empty batch handling] Does batch_verify with an empty keys_and_signatures vector return Ok(()), allowing an attacker to claim successful verification of nothing and bypass authentication in protocols that check batch verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Signature] [Clone consistency] Does the Clone bound at line 256 preserve all signature properties, or can an attacker clone signatures in a way that makes the clone verify differently than the original? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Signature] [Hash collision] Does the Hash bound properly hash all signature components, or can an attacker find signatures with hash collisions to bypass HashMap-based duplicate detection in transaction pools? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Uniform] [Generate panics] Does generate() handle all edge cases without panicking, or can an attacker provide RNGs that cause panics during key generation, crashing validator nodes during key rotation or setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Genesis] [Genesis key predictability] At line 319, is the genesis() function deterministic across all nodes, and can an attacker pre-compute the genesis keys to compromise the initial validator set or genesis state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Genesis] [Genesis key rotation] Does the Genesis trait allow for safe key rotation away from genesis keys, or are genesis keys permanently embedded in the system creating a persistent attack surface? (High)",
