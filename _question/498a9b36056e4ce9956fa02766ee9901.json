  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [IAT Backdating] Can an attacker backdate the 'iat' claim to a very early timestamp, effectively extending the ephemeral key validity indefinitely within max_exp_horizon_secs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Clock Skew Attack] Does the expiration comparison at line 76 account for clock skew between validators, or can timestamp differences cause consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Struct: OidcClaims] [IAT vs EXP Validation] Are the iat and exp claims at lines 177-178 validated for logical consistency (iat < exp), or can reversed values bypass expiration checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Audience Confusion] When idc_aud_val override is used at lines 88-101, can an attacker exploit mismatches between JWT aud and IDC aud to access accounts intended for different audiences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Allowlist Bypass] Can the is_allowed_override_aud check at lines 92-98 be bypassed through Unicode normalization, case manipulation, or URL encoding differences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Issuer Validation] Does the iss comparison at line 81 use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about valid issuers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Struct: OidcClaims] [Multiple Audience] Can the aud field at line 174 be an array instead of string in actual JWT, causing deserialization to fail or only check first audience? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Null Byte Injection] Can issuer or audience strings contain null bytes that cause early string termination in comparisons, bypassing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_claims()] [Panic on Deserialization] Can malformed jwt_payload_json cause serde_json to panic at line 62 instead of returning error, leading to validator crashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: reconstruct_oauth_nonce()] [Propagation Failure] Can errors from pad_and_pack_bytes_to_scalars_with_len or pack_bytes_to_one_scalar be silently ignored, causing incorrect nonce acceptance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: get_uid_val()] [Nested Error Handling] Can the context() error wrapping at lines 200, 211, 218, 220 hide critical validation failures that should abort transaction execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/openid_sig.rs] [Function: verify_jwt_signature()] [Silent Failure] Does verify_signature_without_exp_check properly propagate all RSA verification errors, or can some failures be silently ignored? (High)",
