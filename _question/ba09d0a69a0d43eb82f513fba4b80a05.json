  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Sync] [Replay] When replaying historical transactions, can code_invariant_error() be triggered by old transactions that were valid under old rules, causing replay failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [API] [Status Exposure] Are DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR errors exposed through the REST API in a way that leaks internal implementation details to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [API] [Retry Logic] If client applications retry transactions that failed with code_invariant_error(), can this exacerbate DoS attacks or cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [API] [Error Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on transactions that trigger code_invariant_error() to prevent abuse? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Network] [Eclipse Attack] Can an attacker partition the network and feed different transactions to different validator sets, causing some to trigger code_invariant_error() while others don't? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Network] [Message Tampering] If P2P messages related to delayed fields are tampered with, can this cause validators to trigger code_invariant_error() inconsistently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage: view.rs] In replace_values_with_identifiers() error handling, does the code_invariant_error() properly distinguish between user errors and true invariant violations, or can user input trigger invariant errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage: executor.rs] When transactions are discarded in sequential fallback due to code_invariant_error(), is there a maximum number of consecutive discards before the block is rejected entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage: vm_wrapper.rs] Does the ExecutionStatus::DelayedFieldsCodeInvariantError properly prevent the transaction from being included in the block output, or can it still affect state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage: change_set.rs] When detecting duplicate keys and triggering code_invariant_error(), is this check race-free in parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Threat Model] [Byzantine Assumption] Does the code assume that code_invariant_error() can only be triggered by bugs and not by Byzantine behavior, potentially missing adversarial scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Threat Model] [Collusion] Can a colluding set of validators (< 1/3) coordinate to trigger code_invariant_error() at specific times to manipulate transaction ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Threat Model] [Rational Adversary] Can a rational economic attacker profit from deliberately triggering code_invariant_error() to force sequential execution and front-run transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Crypto] [Signature Verification] If code_invariant_error() occurs during signature verification in delayed field operations, can this bypass authentication checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Crypto] [Hash Collisions] Can hash collisions in delayed field identifiers cause expect_ok() to fail and trigger code_invariant_error(), enabling collision-based attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Move Contract] [Reentrancy] If a Move contract calls back into delayed field operations and triggers code_invariant_error(), can this bypass reentrancy guards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Move Contract] [Abort Handling] Can Move contracts detect and handle code_invariant_error() differently than normal errors, creating unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Move Contract] [Resource Safety] If code_invariant_error() occurs while manipulating Move resources, can this violate Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)"
