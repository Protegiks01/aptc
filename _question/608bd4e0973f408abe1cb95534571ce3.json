  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [No checksum verification] Does the upload operation include checksum validation (e.g., MD5, SHA256) to ensure data integrity during transmission, or can network corruption silently corrupt NFT metadata in storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Upload verification missing] After successful upload, is there any verification that the stored file content matches what was sent, or can partial writes or corruption go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Filename collision] If two different URIs happen to produce the same SHA256 hash (collision), will the second upload silently overwrite the first without any collision detection or warning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Content validation] Is there any validation that the uploaded image buffer actually contains valid image data of the specified format, or can corrupt or malicious data be stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [UTF-8 validation] Does the JSON string serialization ensure valid UTF-8 encoding before converting to bytes, or can encoding errors corrupt the stored metadata? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [API quota exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger excessive calls to write_json_to_gcs() to exhaust GCS API quota limits, causing denial of service for legitimate NFT metadata uploads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Upload type manipulation] Can the UploadType::Simple configuration be exploited by manipulating Media parameters to trigger different GCS behavior that bypasses security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Request forgery] Does the UploadObjectRequest properly authenticate with GCS, or can request parameters be manipulated to forge uploads as different GCS identities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Multipart upload bypass] By using Simple upload type, are there size limits that could be bypassed using Multipart uploads, and does this create consistency issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Client credential exposure] Is the GCS Client properly secured to prevent credential leakage through error messages, logs, or memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Filename prefix manipulation] Does hardcoding 'cdn/' as filename prefix prevent attackers from writing outside this directory, or can crafted URIs bypass this through hash collision or other means?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Filename length limit] Does GCS have filename length limits, and can extremely long SHA256 hashes cause upload failures or truncation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Multiple extension injection] Can the extension variable contain multiple extensions (e.g., from manipulated ImageFormat), creating security issues like .jpg.php that exploit vulnerable file handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Reserved filename bypass] Are there checks to prevent creating files with reserved GCS names or special characters that could interfere with bucket operations? (Low)",
