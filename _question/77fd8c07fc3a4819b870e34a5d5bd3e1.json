  "[File: types/src/account_config/resources/fixed_supply.rs] [Struct: FixedSupplyResource] [Consensus split] Can different validators deserialize the same BCS bytes into different FixedSupplyResource values (due to non-deterministic deserialization or endianness issues), causing consensus failures and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/resources/fixed_supply.rs] [Struct: FixedSupplyResource] [Storage cost bypass] Can an attacker create FixedSupplyResource with enormous EventHandle state (millions of events) without paying proportional gas, exhausting validator storage and causing state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/resources/fixed_supply.rs] [Function: current_supply()] [CPU exhaustion] Can calling current_supply() or other getters trigger expensive computations if EventHandle contains complex internal structures, enabling transaction-level DoS by repeatedly querying supply? (Low)"
