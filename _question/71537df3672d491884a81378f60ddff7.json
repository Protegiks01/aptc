(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkOptionsCommand::execute()] [SSRF attack] Does network_options() prevent URL injection through the network_identifier in the NetworkRequest, potentially allowing requests to arbitrary internal endpoints via crafted chain_id values?
