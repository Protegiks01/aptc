  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious YAML/JSON configuration file with extremely long string values in 'configuration_id' or 'configuration_name' fields to cause memory exhaustion or buffer overflows during deserialization, potentially leading to denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker supply a malicious NodeAddress with a crafted URL pointing to an attacker-controlled server, allowing them to intercept baseline node health check requests and return falsified metrics to manipulate node evaluation results? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_id] [Identifier Collision] Does the system validate that configuration_id values are unique across all loaded baseline configurations, or can an attacker provide duplicate IDs causing configuration overwrite or selection confusion that could route health checks to wrong baselines? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Type Confusion] Since the struct uses #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)], can an attacker exploit serde deserialization bugs by providing fields with unexpected types (e.g., array instead of string) that pass initial parsing but cause runtime panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious CheckerConfig variants into the 'checkers' Vec during deserialization that instantiate checkers with extreme resource requirements (e.g., infinite timeout values, excessive retry counts) causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Path Traversal] If NodeAddress URL field accepts file:// scheme URLs, can an attacker craft a configuration that reads arbitrary local files when the health checker attempts to connect to the 'baseline node', leaking sensitive validator configuration or key material? (Critical)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Configuration Override] Can an attacker supply malicious ProviderConfigs with extreme cache_ttl_ms or check_delay_secs values causing providers to cache stale/incorrect baseline data indefinitely or introduce excessive delays that timeout legitimate health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: runner_config] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker set SyncRunnerConfig.num_retries to u8::MAX (255) combined with large retry_delay_secs causing health check operations to take hours to complete and exhausting server thread pools? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Validation Bypass] Does the configuration system validate that if checkers require a baseline node (e.g., HandshakeChecker, ConsensusProposalsChecker), the node_address field must be Some, or can attackers provide configurations with required checkers but None node_address causing runtime panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_name] [XSS/Injection] If configuration_name is displayed in web UIs without sanitization, can an attacker inject malicious HTML/JavaScript in this field during configuration loading that executes in operator browsers viewing the NHC dashboard? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Checker Order Dependency] Does the order of checkers in the Vec matter for security-critical checks, and can an attacker reorder checkers during deserialization to bypass validation (e.g., running TransactionCorrectness before NodeIdentity) that masks compromised nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Integer Overflow] In related validation code, can extreme values in runner_config.retry_delay_secs (u16::MAX) multiplied by num_retries cause integer overflow when calculating total timeout durations leading to incorrect timeout logic? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [SSRF Attack] Can an attacker configure node_address URL to point to internal infrastructure endpoints (e.g., http://169.254.169.254/ for cloud metadata) allowing the health checker service to be exploited as an SSRF proxy to access internal resources? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Race Condition] If multiple threads simultaneously deserialize or access the same BaselineConfiguration instance during hot-reload or concurrent health checks, are there race conditions in shared field access (especially node_address with cookie_store) that could cause data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker set provider_configs with check_delay_secs=0 causing providers to hammer baseline nodes with requests in tight loops leading to unintentional DoS of the baseline infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Missing Required Checker] Does the system enforce that critical security checkers (e.g., NodeIdentityChecker, HandshakeChecker) must always be present with required=true, or can attackers load minimal configurations that skip essential security validations? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Configuration Tampering] Are loaded configuration files cryptographically signed or integrity-protected, or can an attacker with filesystem access modify configuration files to inject malicious baseline URLs or disable security-critical checkers? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [TLS Certificate Validation] If NodeAddress URL uses HTTPS, does the health checker properly validate TLS certificates, or can an attacker configure a baseline URL with self-signed certificates that bypass validation and enable man-in-the-middle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: configuration_id] [Command Injection] If configuration_id is used in logging, filesystem paths, or shell commands without sanitization, can an attacker inject special characters (e.g., '../', ';', '|') to achieve path traversal or command injection? (High)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker provide a YAML configuration with deeply nested structures or circular references in the checkers/provider_configs fields that cause exponential memory consumption or stack overflow during serde deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: runner_config] [Default Value Attack] Does the #[serde(default)] annotation on runner_config allow attackers to omit this field entirely, causing the system to use potentially insecure default values (num_retries=0) that disable retry logic for intermittent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: provider_configs] [Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker set provider_configs.cache_ttl_ms to an extremely high value (u64::MAX milliseconds ≈ 584 million years) causing providers to cache initial baseline responses forever, even if the baseline node becomes compromised? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Struct: BaselineConfiguration] [Clone Safety] Since BaselineConfiguration derives Clone, if it's cloned across threads with the node_address containing a shared Arc<Jar> cookie_store, can race conditions in cookie access during concurrent health checks cause authentication bypass or session confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: node_address] [Port Confusion] If NodeAddress specifies different ports for api_port, metrics_port, and noise_port, can an attacker configure ports pointing to different services (e.g., api_port pointing to a malicious server) causing checkers to validate against wrong endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/types.rs] [Field: checkers] [Checker Duplication] Can an attacker include the same CheckerConfig variant multiple times in the checkers Vec (e.g., 100 LatencyChecker instances) causing excessive resource consumption and DoS when all checkers execute in parallel? (Medium)"
