  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Edge case] [Single block] If blocks vector contains only one block (the root), does find_blocks_to_prune() correctly handle this edge case? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Edge case] [Duplicate blocks] Can the blocks vector contain duplicate blocks with the same ID, and if so, does the code handle this correctly or cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Edge case] [Duplicate QCs] Can quorum_certs contain multiple QCs for the same block, and does this cause issues in the find operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Fork creation] Can a Byzantine validator save conflicting blocks for the same round in their local ConsensusDB, then selectively recover one version to create forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Vote equivocation] Can save_vote() be used to persistently store equivocating votes that help a Byzantine validator avoid detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [QC forgery] If a Byzantine validator forges QCs with invalid signatures and saves them via save_tree(), will recovery detect this or propagate the forged QCs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Timeout manipulation] Can Byzantine validators save arbitrarily high timeout certificates to force honest validators to skip many rounds upon restart? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Root manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate their local LedgerInfo to point to a different root block, causing them to recover with a forked chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Window confusion] In ordered voting mode, can inconsistent window_root_block across validators cause them to execute different transaction sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Pruning DoS] Can an attacker force excessive pruning by manipulating block_ids, causing legitimate blocks to be deleted and consensus to stall? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consensus attack] [Recovery divergence] Can different validators recover to different states from the same ConsensusDB and LedgerInfo, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Durability] [Crash during save] If the system crashes during save_tree(), is the write atomic or can it leave ConsensusDB in a corrupted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Durability] [Fsync requirements] Does save_tree() ensure data is fsynced to disk, or can power failures cause loss of supposedly-persisted consensus data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Durability] [Vote persistence] Is save_vote() durable across crashes, or can it lose the last vote causing safety violations after restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Durability] [TC persistence] Can save_highest_2chain_timeout_cert() lose data during crashes, causing liveness issues during recovery? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consistency] [DB divergence] Can ConsensusDB and AptosDB become inconsistent with each other, causing recover_from_ledger() to return incompatible data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Consistency] [Read-after-write] Does the implementation guarantee read-after-write consistency, or can save_tree() followed immediately by start() read stale data? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Serialization] [Size limits] Are there maximum size limits on serialized Vote or TwoChainTimeoutCertificate objects to prevent DoS via huge objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Serialization] [Type confusion] Can BCS deserialization be confused by type changes between software versions, causing validators to interpret data incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Window logic] [Size mismatch] If different validators have different window_size configurations, can this cause them to select different window_root_blocks and diverge? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Window logic] [Huge window] Can an extremely large window_size cause the window to extend before genesis, breaking the traversal logic in find_root_with_window()? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Window logic] [Window vs commit root] If window_root_block is at a lower round than commit_root_block expects, can this cause execution pipeline to miss transactions? (High)"
