  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Concurrency] [Non-Atomic Operations] Are the multiple read operations on discovered_peers atomic as a whole, or can intermediate state changes create inconsistent peer selection results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock Ordering] If peer selection functions are called while holding other locks, can lock ordering issues cause deadlocks with threads trying to update discovered_peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [RNG Security] [Seed Prediction] Is thread_rng() properly seeded with sufficient entropy, or can attackers predict future peer selection by observing previous selection patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [RNG Security] [Reproducible Selection] Can attackers cause the RNG to enter a known state, making peer selection deterministic and predictable, enabling targeted eclipse attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [RNG Security] [Entropy Exhaustion] In high-throughput scenarios with frequent peer selection, can the system exhaust entropy sources, degrading RNG quality and making selection predictable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Math] [Floating Point Comparison] Does OrderedFloat correctly handle NaN, Infinity, and negative zero in weight comparisons, or can these special values break weighted selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Math] [Precision Loss] After many halvings in convert_latency_to_weight, can floating point precision loss cause multiple distinct latencies to map to the same weight, degrading selection quality? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Math] [Denormal Numbers] Can very small weight values become denormalized floats, causing performance degradation in weighted selection calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Math] [Division Accuracy] Is the division latency_secs / 0.025 at line 162 subject to floating point rounding errors that could cause off-by-one errors in num_reductions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Resource Exhaustion] [HashSet Growth] If eligible_peers or peer_ids contains millions of entries, can HashSet operations cause excessive memory allocation and CPU usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Resource Exhaustion] [Clone Overhead] Does cloning DiscoveredPeer for all selected peers create significant overhead when dealing with large peer sets, slowing validator operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Resource Exhaustion] [Vector Allocation] Can the collect() operations that build vectors from iterators cause excessive allocations when dealing with very large peer sets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [State Consistency] [Stale Peer Data] If DiscoveredPeer data becomes stale between selection and actual connection attempt, can this cause connection failures that degrade network connectivity? (Medium)"
