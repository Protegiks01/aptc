  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::new()] [Shared state corruption] All validators in the pool share the same db_reader clone at line 132 - can concurrent access to this shared DbReader cause state corruption or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::new()] [Initialization failure] If VMValidator::new() panics during pool creation at line 132, does the entire pool construction fail or could we have a partially initialized pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::get_next_vm()] [Random selection bias] The random index selection at lines 138-139 uses gen_range(0, len) - can the randomness be predicted or manipulated to cause uneven load distribution leading to validator performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::get_next_vm()] [Thread-local RNG security] thread_rng() is used at line 138 - is this cryptographically secure randomness, or could predictable RNG state allow an attacker to determine which VM will validate their transaction?

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::get_next_vm()] [Load distribution attack] Can an attacker repeatedly send transactions timed to exploit RNG patterns, ensuring all their transactions hit the same VM in the pool, causing targeted DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Panic recovery] At lines 156-166, std::panic::catch_unwind catches VM panics - does this properly clean up VM state, or can panics leave the VM in a corrupted state for subsequent validations? (Critical)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Mutex poisoning] At line 157, lock().unwrap() is called - if the lock is poisoned from a previous panic, this will panic again - can an attacker trigger repeated panics to permanently disable validators in the pool?

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: PooledVMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Validation bypass] The catch_unwind at line 156 converts panics to errors - can an attacker craft transactions that intentionally panic to bypass validation checks and get rejected with generic errors?
