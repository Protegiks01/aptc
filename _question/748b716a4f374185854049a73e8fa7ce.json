  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Pairing equation] At lines 598-608, a multi-pairing check verifies h(tau). Can the pairing equation be manipulated by an attacker who provides carefully crafted c[j] and c_hat[j] values that satisfy the check despite invalid h(X)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Beta multiplication] At line 600, c[j] is multiplied by betas[j]. Can integer overflow or incorrect scalar multiplication allow attackers to cancel out terms in the pairing equation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Subtraction in G2] At line 604, c_hat[j] - vk.tau_2 is computed. Can this subtraction produce incorrect results for points at infinity or identity elements, breaking the pairing check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Vanishing polynomial] At line 605, vk.vanishing_com is used. If this was incorrectly computed in setup (line 172), can all proofs pass verification despite being invalid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Negative d] At line 601, -self.d is included in the pairing. Can the negation operation fail or produce incorrect results for certain curve points, breaking the verification equation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Zero check] At line 608, the result is compared to PairingOutput::ZERO. Can numerical precision issues cause valid proofs to fail verification, or invalid proofs to pass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Iterator chain] At lines 599-606, iterators are chained with .chain(once(...)). Can incorrect iterator ordering or lengths break the pairing equation verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [G1 MSM] At line 613, MSM is computed over self.c with alphas. Can incorrect MSM implementation allow attackers to provide non-dual c and c_hat commitments that pass this check? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [G2 MSM] At line 616, MSM is computed over self.c_hat with alphas. Must both MSMs use identical alpha values and ordering, or can differences allow duality bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Pairing duality] At lines 617-626, the duality check uses pairing e(g1_comb, tau_2) = e(tau_1, g2_comb). Is this equation mathematically correct for all curve pairings, or can certain pairing types allow bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Tau consistency] Are vk.tau_1 and vk.tau_2 guaranteed to be generated from the same tau value, or can setup inconsistencies allow non-matching tau values that break duality guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [MSM unwrap] At lines 613 and 616, .unwrap() is used on MSM results. Can MSM operations legitimately fail for valid inputs, causing panic instead of returning verification failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/range_proofs/dekart_univariate.rs] [Function: verify()] [Vector operations] At lines 618-625, vectors are manually constructed for pairing.
