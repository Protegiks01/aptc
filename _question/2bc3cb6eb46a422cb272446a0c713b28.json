  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Struct: Inliner] [Target State Mutation] At line 132, inline_targets.write_to_env() commits all changes - can partial failures during inlining leave inline_targets in inconsistent state, causing some functions to be rewritten while their callees are not? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: do_inlining_in()] [State Machine] At lines 441-471, RewriteState transitions from Unchanged to Def/Spec - can concurrent access to inline_targets during iteration cause state machine violations, leading to functions being processed multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: run_inlining()] [Target Deletion] At lines 143-156, inline functions are deleted after inlining - can deletion while references still exist cause dangling references in the AST, leading to crashes when those references are accessed? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: inline_call()] [Non-Lambda Function Args] At lines 851-856, non-lambda function arguments trigger errors - can these errors be triggered after partial inlining has occurred, leaving the AST in corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: check_for_return_break_continue_in_lambda()] [Error Recovery] At lines 982-998, multiple error conditions are checked - can error reporting continue after detecting errors, allowing multiple errors to accumulate and incorrect code to proceed to code generation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: rewrite_exp()] [Continue After Error] At line 1259, rewrite_exp_descent proceeds despite errors - can continuing after Return/Break/Continue errors cause additional cascading errors that obscure the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: run_inlining()] [Incomplete Deletion] At lines 145-154, only inline functions with bodies are deleted - can inline function declarations without bodies remain in the program causing confusion for later compiler passes? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: run_inlining()] [Filter Functions] At line 155, env.filter_functions() removes inline functions - can this filtering break references from other modules that call these inline functions, causing link errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: run_inlining()] [Keep Inline Functions Flag] At line 143, keep_inline_functions can prevent deletion - can keeping inline functions cause later compiler passes to attempt codegen for inline functions, producing invalid bytecode? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: construct_inlined_call_expression()] [Empty Args] At lines 1068-1070, empty args list creates None - can this special case cause pattern matching to fail when patterns expect arguments, leading to runtime crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: construct_inlined_call_expression()] [Args Location] At lines 1125-1128, args location uses first arg or call site - can incorrect location selection cause error messages to point to wrong locations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: construct_inlined_call_expression()] [Tuple Creation] At line 1132, Operation::Tuple creates args tuple - can incorrect tuple creation cause args to have wrong type, breaking pattern matching in the Block expression? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: postorder()] [Grey Set] At lines 336-349, grey set tracks partially visited nodes - can nodes be added to grey multiple times causing incorrect postorder numbering, breaking the bottom-up inlining order? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: postorder()] [Visited Set] At lines 340-354, visited set prevents revisiting - can early insertion into visited prevent exploring all paths to a node, causing some dependencies to be missed in the ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/inliner.rs] [Function: postorder()] [Stack Corruption] At line 343, curr is popped and then pushed back - can this pattern cause stack corruption if exceptions occur between pop and push operations? (Low)"
