  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Remote communication] [Message integrity] Are serialized SafetyRulesInput messages cryptographically signed, or can they be tampered with in transit causing incorrect safety decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Remote communication] [Connection hijacking] Can an attacker hijack the TCP connection to the safety rules process and send forged requests causing double-signing or safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [SafetyData persistence] When safety_rules_manager::storage() initializes PersistentSafetyStorage, if storage.set_safety_data() fails partially (crash mid-write), can this cause safety rules to restart with inconsistent epoch/round data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [Consensus key access] Does PersistentSafetyStorage properly protect consensus private keys from unauthorized access when passed to remote_service::execute(), or can process memory dumps leak keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [Cached data staleness] If enable_cached_safety_data is true in SafetyRulesConfig, can the in-memory cache become stale relative to actual storage, causing safety rules to use outdated last_voted_round and violate safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [Storage backend failures] When remote_service::execute() runs with PersistentSafetyStorage, if the backend (OnDiskStorage, Vault) becomes unavailable, does it crash or continue with stale cached data causing safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [Waypoint updates] Can an attacker with storage access modify the waypoint after Process::new() but before start(), causing safety rules to accept blocks from a forked chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Storage integration] [Author validation] Does safety_rules_manager::storage() validate that the stored Author matches the consensus key, or can mismatched identity cause a validator to sign votes for the wrong account? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Configuration] [Service type mismatch] If SafetyRulesConfig.service is Process but the config is accidentally copied from a Local configuration, does the panic in Process::new() expose sensitive config data in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Configuration] [Test config in production] Can SafetyRulesConfig.test be non-None when using ProcessService, bypassing the mainnet sanitizer check and allowing test consensus keys in production? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Configuration] [Backend availability] Does safety_rules_manager::storage() check internal_storage.available() before initializing, and if storage is unavailable, does Process::new() panic leaving the validator in a bad state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Configuration] [Identity blob tampering] If InitialSafetyRulesConfig loads identity from file, can the file be modified between config load and Process::new() causing validator to initialize with wrong keys? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Configuration] [Overriding keys injection] Does safety_rules_manager::storage() validate overriding_identity_blobs before inserting consensus keys into storage, or can malicious keys be injected causing validator to sign with compromised keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Lifecycle] [Double start prevention] Process.data is Option<ProcessData> and is taken in start() - but if start() is called on a Process where data is already None, does the expect panic safely or leak resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Lifecycle] [Shutdown handling] Process has no stop() or shutdown() method - if the consensus node needs to shut down gracefully, how does it terminate the remote_service::execute() infinite loop without corrupting storage? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Lifecycle] [Resource cleanup] When Process is dropped, is there any cleanup of the safety rules service thread/process, or does it continue running as a zombie process consuming resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Lifecycle] [Epoch transitions] During epoch changes, if a new Process is created with updated SafetyRulesConfig, does the old process shutdown properly without leaving stale safety data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Lifecycle] [Restart safety] If a validator crashes and restarts, does Process::new() correctly load persisted SafetyData from storage, or can it reset to epoch 1 round 0 allowing double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Network service] [Port binding conflicts] If multiple validators are running on the same machine and ProcessService tries to bind to the same server_address, does it fail gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Network service] [Listen address exposure] Does RemoteService expose server_address in logs or metrics, potentially leaking sensitive network topology information to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Network service] [Connection limits] Does remote_service::execute() limit the number of concurrent client connections, or can an attacker open many connections causing resource exhaustion and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Network service] [Request rate limiting] Is there rate limiting on SafetyRulesInput requests to prevent a malicious consensus module from overwhelming the safety rules service with signing requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Network service] [Timeout handling] If a client request times out after network_timeout_ms, does the safety rules process continue processing it, potentially causing duplicate signatures or votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Serialization] [Input deserialization] When remote_service::execute() receives serialized SafetyRulesInput via NetworkServer.read(), can malformed input cause deserialization panics crashing the safety rules process? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Serialization] [Output serialization] If SerializerService.handle_message() produces a response that fails to serialize, does it crash the process or return an error, and can this be exploited for DoS? (Medium)"
