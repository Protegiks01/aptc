  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker craft a PreviousResult with call_idx=u16::MAX referencing a non-existent call, causing out-of-bounds access when the builder attempts to resolve the return value, potentially leading to panic or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Index Manipulation] Can a malicious transaction include PreviousResult with return_idx exceeding the actual number of return values from the referenced call, causing array access violations during script execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Circular Reference] Can an attacker create circular dependencies between PreviousResult references (call N references call M which references call N), causing infinite loops or stack overflow during script composition or execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Type Confusion] Can PreviousResult reference a return value with incompatible type by manipulating call_idx and return_idx, bypassing Move's type safety when the script is executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Forward Reference] Can PreviousResult have call_idx pointing to a future call that hasn't been added yet, causing the builder to access uninitialized memory or undefined state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Serialization Attack] Can a maliciously crafted serialized PreviousResult bypass validation by encoding invalid call_idx/return_idx values that appear valid during deserialization but cause issues during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Concurrent Modification] In a multi-threaded context using LOADED_MODULES, can race conditions allow PreviousResult indices to become invalid between validation and execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PreviousResult] [Operation Type Mismatch] Can operation_type be manipulated after PreviousResult creation to violate Move's borrow checking rules (e.g., changing Move to BorrowMut after validation)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Raw Bytes Injection] Can CallArgument::Raw contain maliciously crafted bytes that violate transaction argument constraints but pass initial validation, causing execution failures or exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Signer Index OOB] Can CallArgument::Signer contain signer index exceeding the actual number of signers in a multi-agent transaction, causing out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Signer Impersonation] Can an attacker use CallArgument::Signer(0) in a single-signer transaction to access privileges they shouldn't have by manipulating the signer reference? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Type Tag Mismatch] Can CallArgument::Raw bytes be crafted to deserialize as a different type than expected, bypassing type checking when passed to Move functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Size Bomb] Can CallArgument::Raw contain extremely large Vec<u8> causing memory exhaustion or DoS when the script is composed or executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument::PreviousResult] [Double-Use After Move] Can the same PreviousResult with ArgumentOperation::Move be used multiple times, violating Move's resource ownership semantics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Discriminant Manipulation] Can the enum discriminant be manipulated in serialized form to cause type confusion between Raw, Signer, and PreviousResult variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: CallArgument] [Clone Exploit] Since CallArgument derives Clone, can an attacker clone a CallArgument with Move operation and use it multiple times, violating move semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: ArgumentOperation] [Move Violation] Can ArgumentOperation::Move be applied to a value that doesn't have move capability, causing undefined behavior during bytecode generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: ArgumentOperation] [Copy Without Ability] Can ArgumentOperation::Copy be used on types without Copy ability, bypassing ability checking and causing runtime violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/script-composer/src/lib.rs] [Enum: ArgumentOperation] [Borrow Lifetime] Can ArgumentOperation::Borrow or BorrowMut create references that outlive their referents, causing use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
