  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Line: 7] [Dependency Risk] Can bugs or vulnerabilities in the prometheus crate's IntCounter implementation cause counter corruption or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Line: 7] [Dependency Risk] If the prometheus crate is compromised, can malicious code in register_int_counter!() macro execute arbitrary code during counter initialization? (High)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [All unwrap()] [Error Handling] Can all seven counter initializations fail silently in some edge cases instead of panicking, causing missing metrics without any indication? (Medium)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 10-12] [Error Handling] If STRUCT_LOG_COUNT registration fails during validator startup, is there a fallback mechanism or does the entire node fail to start? (High)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 24-29] [Error Handling] If any of ERROR_LOG_COUNT, WARN_LOG_COUNT, or INFO_LOG_COUNT fail to initialize, can the logging system continue operating in a degraded mode? (Medium)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 10-12] [Performance DoS] Can an attacker cause excessive STRUCT_LOG_COUNT increments by flooding the system with log-generating transactions, degrading validator performance? (Note: Traditional DoS out of scope, but counter performance impact in scope) (Low)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 24-29] [Performance Impact] Can incrementing ERROR_LOG_COUNT, WARN_LOG_COUNT, and INFO_LOG_COUNT on every log event create contention hotspots affecting validator throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 32-38] [Performance Impact] Can frequent increments of STRUCT_LOG_QUEUE_ERROR_COUNT during queue saturation further degrade logging performance through counter contention? (Low)",

  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 10-12] [State Manipulation] Can STRUCT_LOG_COUNT be directly modified through unsafe Rust code elsewhere in the codebase, bypassing normal increment logic? (Low)",
  "[File: crates/aptos-logger/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 24-29] [State Manipulation] Can ERROR_LOG_COUNT be artificially inflated by malicious code to trigger false alarms and desensitize operators to real issues? (Low)"
