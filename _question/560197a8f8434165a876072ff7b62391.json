  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Notification channel poisoning] Can an attacker inject malicious connection notifications through connection_notifs_rx (line 35) before the ConnectivityManager processes them, causing it to believe peers are connected/disconnected when they aren't, leading to connection management failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Latency dial manipulation] When enable_latency_aware_dialing is true (line 38), can an attacker manipulate network latency measurements or ping results to influence peer selection, causing the validator to preferentially connect to malicious peers with artificially low reported latencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Connection limit race] If outbound_connection_limit (line 36) is set to a small value like 1, can concurrent dial attempts race to check the limit simultaneously, allowing more outbound connections than permitted and bypassing the connection limit enforcement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Backoff strategy manipulation] Does ExponentialBackoff::from_millis(backoff_base).factor(1000) (line 56) properly handle edge cases where backoff_base is MAX_U64, potentially causing multiplication overflow that results in immediate reconnection attempts without backoff? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Seed peer priority confusion] When seeds PeerSet (line 29) is passed as DiscoverySource::Config, can these seed addresses override or conflict with OnChainValidatorSet addresses, potentially causing validators to connect to attacker-controlled seed nodes instead of legitimate validator addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Discovery source injection] Can an attacker provide seeds containing PeerId values that collide with legitimate validator PeerIds, causing the ConnectivityManager to dial malicious addresses when attempting to connect to trusted validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Public key confusion] Do the seeds PeerSet contain public keys that are validated against peers_and_metadata's trusted peers, or can seeds include arbitrary public keys that bypass authentication when mutual_authentication is disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Address validation bypass] Are NetworkAddresses in the seeds PeerSet validated for correct format and reachability, or can malicious seeds contain invalid addresses (like localhost, 0.0.0.0, or malformed IPs) that cause dial failures and connection storms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Struct: ConnectivityManagerBuilder] [Thread safety] Is ConnectivityManagerBuilder marked as Send/Sync, and if start() is called from one thread while another thread calls conn_mgr_reqs_tx(), can this cause data races accessing the connectivity_manager Option (line 20) or conn_mgr_reqs_tx field (line 21)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Executor thread pool exhaustion] If the Handle executor (line 69) is already at capacity when spawn() is called, does the ConnectivityManager task get queued indefinitely or dropped, causing the validator to operate without connectivity management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Channel receiver ownership] After conn_mgr_reqs_rx is moved into ConnectivityManager::new() (line 54), can any code accidentally clone or share the receiver, allowing multiple tasks to compete for ConnectivityRequests and causing non-deterministic request processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Mutable borrow violation] Does start() take &mut self (line 69) to safely take() the connectivity_manager Option, or could calling methods on the builder after start() cause use-after-move errors or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Type: ConnectivityManagerService] [Backoff strategy hardcoding] The type alias fixes TBackoff to ExponentialBackoff (line 17), but can this limitation be exploited where attackers force specific backoff behavior that's unsuitable for attack scenarios, like creating predictable reconnection patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Generic constraint bypass] Does ExponentialBackoff properly implement the Iterator<Item = Duration> + Clone constraint required by ConnectivityManager, or can it produce invalid Durations (like infinite or zero) that break dial scheduling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Partial initialization] If any of the parameters to create() are invalid but not immediately validated, can the ConnectivityManager be constructed in a partially initialized state that appears valid but causes failures when start() is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Builder reuse] After calling start() which takes the connectivity_manager Option, can the ConnectivityManagerBuilder be reused or does it remain in an invalid state, and if reused, could this cause confusion or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Network context validation] Does the NetworkContext (line 26) get validated to ensure it corresponds to a valid network (Validator, VFN, Public), or can an invalid or malicious network context cause the ConnectivityManager to operate with incorrect trust assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Interval manipulation] Can connectivity_check_interval_ms (line 30) be set to MAX_U64 causing Duration::from_millis() to create an extremely long interval, effectively disabling connectivity checks and allowing stale connections to persist indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Delay cap bypass] If max_connection_delay_ms (line 32) is smaller than the backoff delays produced by ExponentialBackoff, does the capping work correctly, or can integer truncation cause unexpected behavior where delays wrap around to small values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Backoff factor overflow] The hardcoded .factor(1000) in line 56 multiplies backoff_base by 1000, but if backoff_base is large, can this cause arithmetic overflow that either panics or produces incorrect delays affecting connection stability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Zero interval attack] Can connectivity_check_interval_ms be set to 0, and if so, does this cause the time_service.interval() to trigger immediately and continuously, creating a tight loop that consumes 100% CPU and degrades validator performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Authentication downgrade] If mutual_authentication (line 37) is false for a validator network context, does this allow server-only authentication where inbound connections aren't properly validated, enabling Sybil attacks where malicious peers connect en masse? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Trust assumption violation] Does the builder enforce that mutual_authentication must be true for validator networks, or can misconfiguration allow validators to operate with weakened authentication, violating the Byzantine fault tolerance trust model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Trusted peer bypass] When ConnectivityManager::new() initializes and checks that trusted_peers is empty, can an attacker race to add trusted peers immediately after this check but before the ConnectivityManager starts, bypassing the validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Connection limit overflow] If outbound_connection_limit (line 36) is set to Some(usize::MAX), can this cause integer overflow when calculating available connection slots, potentially allowing unlimited connections despite the limit being set?
