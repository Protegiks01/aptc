  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: StageSwitchCondition] [WhenPoolBecomesEmpty race] ObjectPool<LocalAccount> length check is not atomic with pool operations - can accounts be added after len()==0 check but before stage transition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: StageSwitchCondition] [MaxTransactions precision] Using Arc<AtomicUsize> with Relaxed ordering - can transactions be lost or double-counted due to memory reordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: StageSwitchCondition] [Condition switching] Can StageSwitchCondition change variant (pool to max_transactions) after creation, breaking stage transition assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: WorkflowTxnGenerator] [Generator vector bounds] generators and stage_switch_conditions must have specific length relationship - is this enforced, or can mismatched lengths cause out-of-bounds access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: WorkflowTxnGenerator] [Mutable generator access] generate_transactions takes &mut self and calls generator.generate_transactions - can this mutability cause aliasing issues with shared stage state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: WorkflowTxnGenerator] [Stage overflow] Stage is usize which can theoretically overflow - can stage counter increment past usize::MAX causing wraparound to 0 and restarting workflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Trait: WorkflowKind] [Async construct_workflow] construct_workflow is async - can implementations leave partially constructed state if cancelled, causing later panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Trait: WorkflowKind] [Clone semantics] clone_workflow_kind returns Box<dyn WorkflowKind> - can this cause memory leaks or use-after-free if implementations don't properly clone internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Trait: CloneWorkflowKind] [Dynamic dispatch] Clone for Box<dyn WorkflowKind> uses dynamic dispatch - can this be exploited with malicious implementations to bypass stage tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Stage transition atomicity] Stage check, should_switch check, and compare_exchange are separate operations - can race between them cause duplicate stage transitions or skipped stages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Multiple workers] If multiple threads call generate_transactions concurrently, can they all pass should_switch() and all attempt compare_exchange, causing stage to jump multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Stage boundary] When transitioning from stage N to N+1, can some threads still process stage N transactions after stage_counter is updated? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGeneratorCreator::new_staged_with_account_pool()] [Account creation overflow] num_accounts is used to create accounts - can extremely large values exhaust memory or cause integer overflow in balance calculations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Empty result handling] When generator.generate_transactions returns empty Vec, reduce_txn_count(0) is called - can this cause infinite loops if condition never becomes should_switch=true?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Partial generation] If generator returns fewer transactions than num_to_create, can reduce_txn_count cause premature stage switching before all intended transactions are created? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Account reuse] LocalAccount is passed to generator - can malicious generator modify account state causing subsequent stages to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Silent failures] compare_exchange failures are ignored - can this hide critical stage transition failures causing stuck workflows? (Medium)",
