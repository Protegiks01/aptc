  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [Integer Overflow] Can the block_height field overflow when converted from U64 wrapper to u64, potentially causing incorrect block height representation that could confuse clients about chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [Integer Overflow] Can the block_timestamp field overflow during U64 to u64 conversion, causing timestamp wraparound that could break time-based consensus logic or transaction ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [Range Validation] Are first_version and last_version validated to ensure first_version <= last_version, or can an attacker construct a Block with inverted version range causing state corruption? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [Transaction Ordering] When transactions is populated, is the sequential ordering enforced, or can transactions be out of order causing incorrect state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [Empty Block Handling] Can block_height exist with first_version > last_version creating an invalid empty block that bypasses validation logic? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: BcsBlock] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can block_timestamp be set to values in the far future or past, bypassing consensus timing constraints and causing liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: BcsBlock] [Hash Collision] Can two different blocks produce the same block_hash (aptos_crypto::HashValue) due to insufficient hash input validation, causing chain fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: BcsBlock] [Version Range Attack] Can first_version be set to 0 and last_version to u64::MAX creating a block spanning the entire chain history, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: BcsBlock] [Transaction Count Validation] If transactions is Some, is the Vec length validated against max_block_transactions_page_size to prevent API abuse? (Medium)",
