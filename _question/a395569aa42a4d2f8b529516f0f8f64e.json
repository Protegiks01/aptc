  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Seed verification bypass] Is config.verify_seeds() sufficient to prevent malicious seed injection, or can an attacker provide well-formed but Byzantine seeds that pass verification but connect to malicious endpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [PeerRole manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the PeerRole::ValidatorFullNode assigned to seed_addrs peers to escalate privileges, gaining validator-level access or permissions when only fullnode access should be granted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Multiple pubkey attack] If a NetworkAddress contains multiple noise protocol pubkeys through crafted addressing, does the .for_each() loop insert all keys allowing a single peer to masquerade as multiple validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Seed memory exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely large seed sets (millions of peers) in config.seeds or config.seed_addrs to exhaust validator memory during merge_seeds(), causing OOM crashes and network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Connection limit bypass] For non-validator networks, outbound_connection_limit is set to Some(max_outbound_connections), but for validator networks it's None - can this unlimited connection behavior for validators be exploited to create resource exhaustion through connection flooding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Connection backoff manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate connection_backoff_base or max_connection_delay_ms parameters to either disable backoff (causing connection storms) or create excessively long delays (preventing legitimate reconnections), disrupting consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Connectivity check interval attack] Can connectivity_check_interval_ms be set to extremely small values to cause excessive connectivity checks consuming CPU/network resources, or extremely large values to prevent detection of disconnected validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Mutual authentication mismatch] If mutual_authentication parameter differs from the authentication_mode used in peer_manager_builder, can this create an authentication inconsistency where connectivity manager expects mutual auth but peer manager allows maybe-mutual, enabling authentication bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Channel size exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the connectivity manager's channels (channel_size parameter) with connection requests to cause message drops, leading to validators failing to establish required connections and losing consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Latency aware dialing attack] When enable_latency_aware_dialing is true, can an attacker manipulate latency measurements to cause validators to prefer connections to high-latency malicious nodes, degrading consensus performance or enabling timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Connection event listener race] Does pm_conn_mgr_notifs_rx channel synchronization properly handle concurrent connection events, or can race conditions cause missed disconnection notifications, leaving connectivity manager with stale connection state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Frame size integer overflow] Can max_frame_size parameter overflow when multiplied or added with other sizes in downstream protocol handling, allowing an attacker to bypass frame size limits and send arbitrarily large frames causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Message size bypass] Is max_message_size properly enforced across all protocol layers, or can an attacker send messages that fit within max_frame_size but exceed max_message_size when reassembled, causing buffer overflows or memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Network channel overflow] Can network_channel_size be set to values causing integer overflow when calculating total buffer sizes across all network components, leading to allocation failures or unbounded memory growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Inbound connection limit bypass] Can inbound_connection_limit be circumvented by an attacker establishing connections faster than they're tracked, or through IP address rotation, allowing unlimited inbound connections and resource exhaustion?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [TCP buffer size attack] Can tcp_buffer_cfg parameters (inbound_rx_buffer_size_bytes, inbound_tx_buffer_size_bytes, etc.) be manipulated to create extremely large buffers causing memory exhaustion, or zero-sized buffers causing packet drops and connection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Config parameter injection] Can NetworkConfig contain malicious values for max_frame_size, max_message_size, or max_inbound_connections that overflow, underflow, or bypass validation checks when passed to NetworkBuilder::new()?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new_for_test()] [Hardcoded limit vulnerability] The use of hardcoded constants MAX_FRAME_SIZE, MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, MAX_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS, MAX_FULLNODE_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS in test mode - can these be exploited if test mode is used in production, providing inappropriate resource limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connection_monitoring()] [Ping interval manipulation] Can ping_interval_ms be set to zero or extremely small values to flood peers with health check messages, causing DoS through excessive ping traffic and CPU consumption for serialization/deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connection_monitoring()] [Ping timeout attack] Can ping_timeout_ms be set extremely high to delay detection of disconnected validators, or extremely low to cause false positives marking healthy peers as failed, both disrupting consensus?
