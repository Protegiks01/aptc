  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Test: test_account_resource_has_special_address] [Special address assumption] The test assumes AccountResource has a special address for gas charging - can breaking this assumption cause incorrect gas metering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero sequence number] Can accounts be created with sequence_number=0 when an account with the same address previously existed, causing sequence number reuse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new_stateless()] [Address edge cases] Does new_stateless() handle special addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.) correctly, or can creating stateless accounts for system addresses cause privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: authentication_key] [Empty authentication key] Can authentication_key be an empty Vec (length 0), and if so, does this bypass all authentication checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: authentication_key] [Maximum size] Can authentication_key be set to Vec::with_capacity(usize::MAX), causing memory exhaustion when the account resource is loaded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new_stateless()] [BCS unwrap failure] What happens if bcs::to_bytes(&address).unwrap() encounters a malformed AccountAddress - can this panic crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Struct: AccountResource] [Field ordering] Does BCS serialization depend on field ordering in the struct definition, and can reordering fields in future versions break deserialization compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: authentication_key] [Key format assumption] Does the code assume authentication_key follows a specific cryptographic format (e.g., SHA3-256 hash), and can violating this assumption break signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new_stateless()] [Key derivation] Using bcs::to_bytes(&address) for authentication_key in new_stateless() - is this cryptographically sound, or can BCS encoding weaknesses enable key prediction attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: authentication_key] [Collision resistance] If two different public keys hash to the same authentication_key, can an attacker gain control of accounts they don't own? (Critical)"
