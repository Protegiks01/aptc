  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Replay protection] Are there mechanisms preventing the same event from being written multiple times within a transaction or across transactions, or can event replay cause storage bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Maximum size handling] What happens when legacy_abstract_memory_size() returns the maximum possible value - does the multiplication with unit_cost overflow or is there bounds checking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Zero-size events] The function uses std::cmp::max(msg.legacy_abstract_memory_size(), 1.into()) - but can this minimum charge of 1 unit be insufficient for zero-size events that still require storage metadata, leading to gas undercharge? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Empty arguments] What if arguments VecDeque is empty when pop_back() is called - is this caught by the debug_assert or can it cause panic in release builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Null type arguments] Can ty_args slice be empty despite debug_assert, and if so, what happens when the function tries to access type information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Transaction abort handling] If the transaction aborts after this function returns Ok, are the charged gas fees properly refunded or can attackers waste validator resources without cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Debug vs release behavior] Since debug_assert! is compiled out in release, can attackers exploit the missing validation in production to cause memory corruption that only manifests in release builds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Architecture differences] Can differences in pointer size, endianness, or memory layout across x86_64 and ARM64 validators cause legacy_abstract_memory_size() to return different values, breaking consensus? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: make_native_write_to_event_store()] [Function pointer stability] Is the Arc<dyn Fn> function pointer stable across recompilation, or can address space layout randomization cause non-deterministic behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Import: Value] [ValueView trait] Does the ValueView trait used by msg.legacy_abstract_memory_size() have consistent implementation across all Value types, or can some types return inconsistent sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Import: NativeContext] The _context parameter is unused - can future changes to NativeContext add state that should be validated but isn't because this native doesn't use it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Import: PartialVMResult] Can the error types in PartialVMResult be exploited to cause information leakage about internal VM state or enable timing attacks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Nested transaction context] If Move supports nested transactions or savepoints, can event writes in rolled-back transactions still consume gas without being reverted? (Medium)",
