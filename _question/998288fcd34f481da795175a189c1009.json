  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Cache poisoning] Can an adversary deliberately trigger hot-to-cold conversions for frequently accessed state, degrading validator performance and transaction throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Version manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator propose blocks with manipulated value_version values that pass validation but cause state divergence when other validators process them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: LRU thrashing] Can targeted access patterns cause pathological LRU eviction behavior where the same slots are repeatedly promoted to hot and evicted to cold? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Panic DoS] Can an attacker craft transaction sequences that systematically trigger all panic! conditions in StateSlot methods to crash multiple validators simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Memory fragmentation] Can alternating hot/cold state transitions cause heap fragmentation, eventually leading to memory allocation failures and validator instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: JMT corruption] By exploiting maybe_update_jmt() with carefully timed min_version values, can an attacker create JMT states that diverge across validators, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker create StateSlots with maximum-size StateValue objects to exceed memory limits, causing out-of-memory validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: State rollback] By manipulating version fields in StateSlots, can an adversary force validators to apply old state values to current transactions, enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_slot.rs] [Attack: Timing side-channel] Does the variable execution time of hash computations in maybe_update_jmt() leak information about StateValue contents, enabling state inference attacks? (Low)"
