  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Atomicity] Does the error handling ensure that either all bytecode is generated successfully or no output files are created, preventing partial state that could be mistakenly deployed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Escalation] Can the assembler be tricked into reading or writing files with elevated privileges if run with sudo or setuid, potentially compromising system security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File Permissions] Does main() validate that output files are created with appropriate restrictive permissions, or could generated bytecode be world-writable, allowing tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use race condition between when Options are parsed at line 10 and when files are accessed by run() at line 11, allowing symlink attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Race Condition] If multiple instances of the assembler run concurrently with the same output directory, can they corrupt each other's output files, leading to invalid bytecode? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply Chain] Does main() validate that the clap parser and codespan_reporting dependencies at lines 4-5 are from trusted sources and haven't been compromised? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Are there known vulnerabilities in the clap argument parsing library used at line 10 that could be exploited through crafted command-line inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integrity] Does the assembler provide any mechanism to cryptographically sign or verify the generated bytecode to detect tampering after generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Reproducibility] Is the bytecode generation deterministic, or could non-deterministic elements in the assembler cause different bytecode outputs from identical inputs, breaking reproducible builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment Injection] Can environment variables affect the behavior of Options::parse() at line 10 or ColorChoice::Auto at line 9 in ways that could compromise security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration] Does the assembler respect any system-wide or user-level security policies, or could it be used to bypass sandboxing or access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory Safety] Does the run() function called at line 11 contain any unsafe code blocks that could lead to memory corruption if given malicious inputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft assembly inputs that cause the assembler to allocate unbounded memory, leading to OOM crashes or system instability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Audit Trail] Does main() log security-relevant events such as file access attempts, bytecode generation, or errors to enable forensic analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Security Monitoring] Are failures during assembly logged in a way that allows detection of potential attack attempts or misuse patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Complexity Attack] Does main() enforce limits on the size or complexity of assembly files processed, or could an attacker provide gigabyte-sized inputs causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Recursion] If the assembly language supports recursive constructs, does main() enforce depth limits to prevent stack overflow attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Output Corruption] Does main() verify the integrity of generated .mv files after run() completes, or could corrupted bytecode be silently written to disk? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode Verification] Does main() perform any post-generation verification that the bytecode is valid and safe before considering assembly successful? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal Safety] If the process receives a signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM) during execution, does main() handle it gracefully to prevent leaving corrupt output files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Interrupt Handling] Can an attacker repeatedly interrupt the assembler to create race conditions or corrupt output state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Reporting] Does the exit code 1 at line 13 adequately distinguish between different failure modes (syntax errors vs I/O errors vs security violations) for automated tooling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-asm/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Exit Codes] Should main() use different exit codes for different error categories to enable better error handling in CI/CD pipelines? (Low)"
