  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert] [Type confusion] Can a malicious implementation of the Convert trait perform unsafe type conversions between incompatible cryptographic types (e.g., converting field elements across different elliptic curve groups), allowing an attacker to bypass cryptographic security guarantees and potentially recover private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert::to()] [Parameter manipulation] Can an attacker provide maliciously crafted AuxType auxiliary data to the Convert::to() method that causes the conversion to produce invalid cryptographic material (e.g., identity elements, weak keys, or biased randomness) that breaks DKG security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert] [Generic type exploit] Since Convert uses generic types ToType and AuxType, can an attacker exploit Rust's type system to instantiate Convert with types that violate cryptographic invariants, such as using non-prime-order groups or weak cryptographic parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert::to()] [Determinism violation] Does the Convert trait guarantee deterministic conversions? Can implementations introduce non-deterministic behavior that causes different validators to compute different converted values from the same input, leading to consensus failures and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert] [Unbounded conversion] Does the Convert trait impose any bounds on conversion complexity? Can an attacker provide inputs that cause extremely expensive conversions (e.g., requiring exponential-time computations), leading to validator DoS and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert::to()] [Reference lifetime] The Convert::to() method takes references (&self, &AuxType).

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert] [Trait bound missing] The Convert trait has no trait bounds on ToType or AuxType.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Convert::to()] [Zero value handling] Can the Convert::to() method be exploited when converting zero/identity elements?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: HasEncryptionPublicParams::get_encryption_public_params()] [Weak parameters] Does the trait enforce cryptographic strength requirements on EncryptionPublicParameters?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: HasEncryptionPublicParams] [Parameter tampering] The method returns a reference &Self::EncryptionPublicParameters.

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: HasEncryptionPublicParams] [Lifetime issues] Does the returned reference lifetime properly prevent use-after-free scenarios where encryption parameters are accessed after the HasEncryptionPublicParams object is dropped during DKG execution? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: HasEncryptionPublicParams] [Parameter validation] Does the trait require that returned EncryptionPublicParameters are cryptographically valid (e.g., generators are in correct subgroup, not identity)? Can invalid parameters be returned that break encryption security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: HasEncryptionPublicParams::get_encryption_public_params()] [Race conditions] In concurrent DKG scenarios, can race conditions in get_encryption_public_params() cause it to return parameters in an inconsistent or partially initialized state, breaking transcript encryption?
