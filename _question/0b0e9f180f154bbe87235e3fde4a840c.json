  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Input validation] Does the max_network_channel_size field have any bounds checking during deserialization, or can an attacker set it to 0 causing immediate channel exhaustion and total loss of JWK consensus liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Integer overflow] Can max_network_channel_size be set to usize::MAX during config deserialization, potentially causing memory allocation failures or integer overflows when creating network channels, leading to validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Resource exhaustion] Is there validation preventing max_network_channel_size from being set to excessively large values (e.g., billions), which could cause memory exhaustion when channel buffers are allocated, enabling DoS against validators? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Configuration consistency] If different validators load configurations with drastically different max_network_channel_size values (e.g., 10 vs 100000), could this create asymmetric message processing capabilities leading to consensus timing issues or network partition? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Default implementation] [Hardcoded value] Is the default value of 256 for max_network_channel_size adequately sized for production JWK consensus under high load, or could Byzantine validators spam observation requests to fill the channel and block legitimate JWK updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Serde attributes] [Deserialization attack] Does the #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] attribute properly prevent attackers from injecting malicious unknown fields during config deserialization that could be exploited in future code versions? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft a malicious TOML/JSON config file that deserializes max_network_channel_size as a negative value (exploiting signed/unsigned confusion), causing undefined behavior when creating channels? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Serde default] [Missing validation] When #[serde(default)] is used in NodeConfig integration, does missing JWKConsensusConfig in the config file silently fall back to default values without logging, potentially hiding misconfigurations in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Channel starvation] If max_network_channel_size is set too low (e.g., 1-10), can Byzantine validators intentionally flood the channel with ObservationRequest messages faster than they're processed, causing permanent JWK consensus stalls? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Message ordering] Does using FIFO queue style with max_network_channel_size create conditions where critical JWK updates are delayed behind lower-priority messages, allowing stale OIDC provider keys to persist and breaking keyless account security? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Epoch boundary] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, could the channel size limit cause message loss if the old epoch's queued messages exceed max_network_channel_size, leading to incomplete JWK consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [RPC timeout interaction] If max_network_channel_size is too small and RPC timeouts are too short, could this create a deadlock where messages are dropped due to channel fullness before responses can be processed, halting JWK consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Integration point] [Network layer coupling] When max_network_channel_size is used to create aptos_channel::Config in aptos-node/src/network.rs, are there runtime checks ensuring the channel size matches the expected message volume from N validators × M OIDC providers? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Self-message bypass] The JWK consensus creates a separate 1024-sized self_sender channel - could this size mismatch allow an attacker to exploit the difference between network channel (256 default) and internal channel sizes to cause message processing inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Missing parameters] Does JWKConsensusConfig lack critical security parameters like max_message_size, rate_limiting_config, or signature_verification_timeout, leaving the network channel vulnerable to oversized message attacks or signature verification DoS? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Clone trait] Since JWKConsensusConfig derives Clone, could concurrent modifications to the config during runtime (if reloading is supported) create race conditions where different threads use inconsistent max_network_channel_size values? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No validation function] Is there a validate() method that ensures max_network_channel_size is within safe bounds (e.g., 16 <= size <= 10000) before the config is applied, or is validation completely absent allowing dangerous values? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Missing metrics] Are there no fields for monitoring thresholds (e.g., channel_full_threshold_percent) that would allow operators to detect when max_network_channel_size is approaching capacity and JWK consensus is at risk? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No rate limiting] Does JWKConsensusConfig lack any rate limiting configuration (messages_per_second, burst_size), allowing malicious validators to spam the channel at unlimited rates until max_network_channel_size is exceeded? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No priority queuing] Is there no priority field to distinguish critical JWK updates from routine observation requests, meaning all messages compete equally for the max_network_channel_size slots potentially blocking urgent security updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Default implementation] [Scaling issues] Is the default max_network_channel_size of 256 based on empirical testing with maximum expected validator count and OIDC provider count, or is it arbitrary and potentially insufficient for mainnet scale? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Default implementation] [Validator set size] With up to 150+ validators in Aptos mainnet, is the default 256 channel size adequate when each validator may broadcast ObservationRequest/Response messages for multiple OIDC providers simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Default implementation] [No per-issuer limits] Does the single max_network_channel_size value apply globally across all OIDC issuers, allowing one issuer's traffic to starve others, or should there be per-issuer channel limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No logging config] Are there no fields for controlling JWK consensus logging verbosity (log_level, sample_rate), making it difficult to diagnose channel saturation issues when max_network_channel_size is repeatedly exceeded? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Missing alert thresholds] Is there no configuration for alerting when channel utilization exceeds percentage thresholds (e.g., 80% of max_network_channel_size), preventing proactive detection of imminent JWK consensus failures? (Low)"
