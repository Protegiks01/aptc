  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: insert_resource()] [Cache poisoning] Can an attacker exploit the BTreeMap entry insertion logic to insert malicious DataCacheEntry objects that poison the cache with crafted struct_tag, layout, or contains_delayed_fields values, causing state corruption across transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: insert_resource()] [Double insertion attack] Does the Entry::Occupied check properly prevent race conditions where concurrent transactions attempt to insert the same resource type at the same address, potentially causing cache inconsistencies or allowing duplicate resource creation?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: create_data_cache_entry()] [Malformed blob attack] Does the deserialize() call properly validate blob structure before ValueSerDeContext processes it, or can crafted blobs cause panics, buffer overruns, or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: into_effects()] [Serialization bypass] Can an attacker manipulate GlobalValue state to produce a value that serializes successfully but deserializes into a different value, breaking state integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: into_custom_effects()] [Resource converter exploit] Can a malicious resource_converter function be injected that produces invalid Resource outputs, bypassing serialization validation and corrupting the ChangeSet?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/data_cache.rs] [Function: load_resource_mut()] [Gas accounting bypass] Does the gas_meter properly account for all operations when bytes_loaded is None (cache hit), or can an attacker exploit cached resources to perform expensive operations without gas charges?
