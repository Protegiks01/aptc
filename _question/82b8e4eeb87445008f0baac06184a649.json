  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [User context injection] Since maybe_user_transaction_context is None, can this be exploited to bypass transaction context checks that would normally prevent unauthorized operations during genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Chain ID tampering] Can the self.chain_id be different from the resolver's expected chain_id, causing genesis state to be written to the wrong chain or enabling replay attacks across chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Feature flag inconsistency] Are self.features guaranteed to match the features expected by the resolver and runtime_environment, or can feature mismatches cause non-deterministic genesis execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [VM config bypass] Can the self.vm_config be modified between GenesisMoveVm creation and new_genesis_session() call, allowing execution limit bypasses during genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Genesis ID manipulation] Is genesis_id cryptographically verified, or can an attacker provide a predictable/known genesis_id to force deterministic 'random' behavior in genesis operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Resolver state mutation] Can the resolver be mutated during the genesis session, causing read-after-write inconsistencies or state corruption in the genesis state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Lifetime extension] Does the returned SessionExt properly bind the resolver's lifetime, or can the session outlive the resolver leading to dangling references and memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_genesis_session()] [Concurrency issues] Can multiple genesis sessions be created simultaneously with different resolvers, causing race conditions in global state or shared caches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: genesis_features()] [Feature mutation] Does returning a reference to self.features allow external code to mutate the features after genesis VM creation, compromising genesis security invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: genesis_features()] [Feature inconsistency] Can the returned features differ from those used in genesis sessions, causing validation to pass but execution to use different feature flags? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: genesis_features()] [Lifetime issues] Is the returned reference properly bounded to prevent access after GenesisMoveVm is dropped, potentially reading freed memory? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: genesis_change_set_configs()] [Configuration persistence] Can these unlimited configs persist beyond genesis, allowing post-genesis transactions to bypass storage costs and exhaust chain storage? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: MoveVmExt::new()] [Environment cloning] Does cloning the AptosEnvironment create proper isolation, or do clones share mutable state (caches, metrics) that could cause race conditions across concurrent VMs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: MoveVmExt::new()] [Reference validation] Is the env parameter validated before cloning, or can a malicious/corrupted environment be cloned and used for transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: MoveVmExt::new()] [Resource consumption] Can repeatedly creating MoveVmExt instances by cloning environments exhaust memory through accumulation of cloned caches and metadata? (Medium)",
