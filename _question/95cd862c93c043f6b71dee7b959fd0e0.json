  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [AptosResponseContent enum] [Variant confusion] At lines 43-53, the enum has Json(Json<T>) and Bcs(Bcs) variants - can type mismatches between content type header and actual variant cause deserialization failures or type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [From implementation] [Content type mismatch] At lines 366-395, responses are built from (AptosResponseContent, LedgerInfo, Status) tuples - can attackers exploit the lack of content-type validation to send JSON when BCS is expected or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [From implementation] [Status code confusion] At lines 398-423, multiple From impls exist for Json and Bcs - can mismatched status codes in different code paths cause clients to misinterpret success/error responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Trait: AptosErrorResponse] [Mutable inner access] At lines 55-61, inner_mut() provides mutable access to AptosError - can this be exploited to modify error codes or messages after validation, causing inconsistent error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Implementation: inner_mut] [Pattern match exhaustion] At lines 279-294, pattern matching over all variants must be exhaustive - can adding new error variants without updating this function cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Error construction] [Untrusted ledger info] At lines 174-188, LedgerInfo is assumed trusted and its fields directly used - can malicious or stale ledger_info objects be injected to create misleading error responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Error construction] [Ledger version rollback] At lines 181-187, ledger_version and oldest_ledger_version are used without validation - can an attacker provide a ledger_info with version < oldest_version to confuse clients about blockchain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Success response] [Stale ledger info] At lines 379-388, LedgerInfo fields are copied into headers - can concurrent updates to ledger_info during response construction cause inconsistent header values within a single response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: version_not_found] [Version validation bypass] At lines 631-638, no validation that requested ledger_version is within valid range [oldest_ledger_version, ledger_version] - can this cause incorrect",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: version_pruned] [Pruning boundary exploit] At lines 664-670, the function reports pruned versions - can race conditions between pruning and API calls cause versions to be reported as",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Trait methods] [Error code injection] At lines 81-85, AptosErrorCode is accepted without validation in the generated trait methods - can attackers provide invalid or out-of-bounds error codes that corrupt the error enum representation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: with_code] [Code-status mismatch] At lines 170-189, error_code is independent of HTTP status - can mismatches between AptosErrorCode enum and the actual HTTP status code cause client confusion or incorrect error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [VM status integration] [Status code overflow] At lines 95-108, VM StatusCode is converted to Option<u64> - can extremely large status codes cause issues when serialized, or confusion with other error codes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: with_vm_status] [Double error encoding] At lines 235-254, both error_code and vm_status are included - can conflicts between these two error representations cause ambiguous error messages or incorrect error routing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Error response fields] [None propagation] At lines 139-160, eight Optional headers are defined - can None values in critical headers like chain_id cause client validation failures or chain confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: with_code_no_info] [Missing ledger info] At lines 191-209, all headers are set to None when ledger_info is unavailable - can this be exploited during bootstrapping or error conditions to hide critical chain state from clients? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Success response] [Optional gas_used] At line 344, gas_used is Option<u64> - can None gas values hide transaction execution costs, enabling economic attacks where users don't pay appropriate fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Success response] [Optional cursor] At line 348, cursor is optional for pagination - can manipulation of None vs Some(cursor) bypass pagination controls or access unauthorized data ranges? (Low)",
