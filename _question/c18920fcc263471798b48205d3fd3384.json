  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Function: PreGeneratedTxnsBenchmarkRunner::run_benchmark()] [Unwrap Panic] Can the unwrap() on line 151 panic if pop() returns None, and is this reachable through normal usage patterns or only programming errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Function: PreGeneratedTxnsBenchmarkRunner::run_benchmark()] [Race Condition] If run_benchmark() is called concurrently from multiple threads on the same instance, can simultaneous pop() operations cause data races or vector index corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Function: PreGeneratedTxnsBenchmarkRunner::run_benchmark()] [Resource Leak] After popping state, transactions, and partitioned_txns, are they properly moved and consumed, or can large allocations remain in scope longer than necessary? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Function: PreGeneratedTxnsBenchmarkRunner::run_benchmark()] [Logic Error] If states, transactions, and partitioned_txns have mismatched lengths due to implementation bugs, can pop() operations go out of sync and pair wrong state with wrong transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Trait: BenchmarkRunner] [Type Safety] Does the trait allow implementers to return arbitrary (usize, usize) tuples without semantic validation, potentially allowing callers to misinterpret parallel vs sequential TPS values?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-benchmarks/src/benchmark_runner.rs] [Trait: BenchmarkRunner] [Concurrency] Does the trait require &mut self, but can implementers violate this by using interior mutability (Arc/Mutex) without proper synchronization, causing race conditions?
