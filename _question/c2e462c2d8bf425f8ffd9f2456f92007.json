  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: setup()] [Weak RNG] Can an attacker predict or influence the RNG state during setup() to generate weak commitment/verification keys, allowing them to forge proofs and compromise the entire DKG ceremony security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: setup()] [Parameter validation] Does setup() validate that degree_bounds contains non-zero values, or can an attacker pass empty/zero degree bounds to generate degenerate keys that break soundness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: setup()] [Parameter validation] Can an attacker provide extremely large degree_bounds values (e.g., u64::MAX) to cause memory exhaustion, integer overflow in key generation, or create keys that enable proof forgery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: setup()] [Parameter validation] Does the trait enforce that degree_bounds is non-empty, or can an attacker call setup() with an empty Vec causing panic/undefined behavior in implementations? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/traits.rs] [Function: setup()] [Key reuse] Does the trait prevent setup keys from being reused across multiple DKG sessions, or can key reuse enable cross-session attacks where old proofs are replayed to disrupt new ceremonies? (High)",
