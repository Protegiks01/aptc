  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Storage cost] Does emitting CoinWithdraw events consume storage resources proportional to their size, or can attackers emit giant events (large coin_type) without paying storage fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Type parameter] Should CoinWithdraw be generic over a type parameter for the coin type instead of using a String, preventing type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Static: COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Empty type_args] Does COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE correctly use empty type_args, or should it require a type argument for the specific coin being withdrawn? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: coin_type()] [Type validation] Does coin_type() validate that the returned string represents a valid Move type, or can it return malformed type strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Send/Sync safety] Is CoinWithdraw properly marked as Send/Sync, or can transferring it across threads lead to data races and memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Static: COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Initialization race] Can multiple threads racing to initialize COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE cause non-deterministic behavior or multiple conflicting TypeTag instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: coin_type] [Mutable access] Can the coin_type field be mutated after CoinWithdraw creation through unsafe code or interior mutability, causing withdrawal amounts to be attributed to wrong coin types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Move compatibility] Is the Rust CoinWithdraw struct layout compatible with the Move CoinWithdraw struct, or can layout mismatches cause deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Version migration] If the CoinWithdraw format changes in a protocol upgrade, can old events still be deserialized, or will historical events become unreadable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module versioning] Does MODULE_NAME account for module versioning, or can upgrades to the coin module break event parsing for CoinWithdraw? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Empty input] Does try_from_bytes() handle empty byte slices correctly, or does it panic or produce undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Large input] Does try_from_bytes() have a maximum input size limit, or can attackers provide gigabyte-sized byte slices causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Null pointer] If coin_type is constructed from a null pointer or uninitialized memory, can this lead to undefined behavior or crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: amount] [Negative amounts] Even though amount is u64 (unsigned), can integer underflow in calling code cause negative withdrawal amounts to be stored as large positive values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Event signing] Are CoinWithdraw events cryptographically signed, or can attackers emit fake withdrawal events without any authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [Signature verification] Does the account field get verified against a signature proving the account owner authorized the withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Event hash] Is there a canonical hash of CoinWithdraw events used for integrity verification, or can events be modified in transit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Event-state consistency] Can CoinWithdraw events be emitted without a corresponding balance deduction, creating inconsistency between events and actual state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Atomic emission] If transaction execution fails after emitting a CoinWithdraw event, is the event rolled back, or does it persist despite the failed withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Double emission] Can a single withdrawal transaction emit multiple CoinWithdraw events for the same withdrawal, causing double-counting in indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Indexer injection] Can maliciously crafted coin_type values exploit SQL injection or NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in downstream indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: coin_type()] [API injection] When coin_type() results are exposed via REST APIs, can special characters cause JSON injection or break API response parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Pagination attack] Can attackers emit massive numbers of CoinWithdraw events to break pagination in indexer queries, causing timeouts or incomplete results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Access control] Is there any access control preventing unauthorized code from calling new() and creating fake withdrawal events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Module restriction] Can only the coin module emit CoinWithdraw events, or can any module create these events causing false withdrawal records? (Critical)"
