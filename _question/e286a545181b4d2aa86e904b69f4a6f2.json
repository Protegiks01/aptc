(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: process_delayed_field_output()] [History Manipulation] At line 356, change.into_entry_no_additional_history() discards history - can attackers exploit this to bypass history-based validations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: process_delayed_field_output()] [Error Recovery] When record_change() fails at lines 359-377, the function captures an error in read_set but continues processing - can this lead to partially applied delayed field changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: process_delayed_field_output()] [Remove Timing] At lines 381-385, delayed fields are removed for prev_modified_delayed_fields - but if another incarnation is executing concurrently, can removes race with new writes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: process_resource_group_output_v2()] [Tag Set Mutation] At line 275, prev_tags are passed to write_v2() but the HashSet could be modified during iteration in multi-threaded scenarios - is this safe? (Medium)",
