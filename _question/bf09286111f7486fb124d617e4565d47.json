  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: default()] [Default behavior] Default trait at lines 191-195 calls new() with no auto-advance - if consensus code uses default construction, can it get different behavior than explicitly constructed instances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: new()] [Initial state] new() initializes now to ZERO_DURATION at line 94 - can consensus code that expects time to start at a specific value break when using mock time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: new_auto_advance_for()] [Deadline bounds] new_auto_advance_for accepts any Duration deadline at line 109 - can passing zero deadline cause all sleeps to be pending immediately? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Type: Mutex] [Poison handling] The code uses aptos_infallible::Mutex at line 6 - does this Mutex type handle poison differently than std::Mutex, and can panics in critical sections cause permanent lock failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: lock()] [Lock ordering] Multiple MockTimeService instances can exist - if consensus code holds locks on multiple instances simultaneously, can this cause deadlock due to lock ordering issues? (Medium)"
