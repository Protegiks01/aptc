  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Input validation] Can an attacker supply a malformed or specially crafted address parameter that bypasses validation and causes the Account::new() call to access arbitrary memory locations or crash the API node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Address spoofing] Can an attacker craft an address with leading zeros or non-canonical formatting that passes Path<Address> parsing but resolves to a different account than intended, allowing unauthorized event access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Address manipulation] Does the address parameter properly validate against system addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.), or can an attacker query events from protected system accounts that should be restricted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Account existence bypass] Can an attacker exploit timing in the Account::new() check where an account exists during validation but is deleted before event retrieval, causing inconsistent state or exposing deleted account data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Address overflow] Can an attacker provide an address that causes integer overflow when converted to AccountAddress in EventKey::new(), potentially accessing events from unintended accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker supply a creation_number parameter at u64::MAX that causes overflow in EventKey::new() or subsequent arithmetic operations, accessing events from wrong streams or crashing the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Creation number spoofing] Can an attacker guess or enumerate creation_numbers to access events from other users' event streams that should be private, violating event confidentiality? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Negative creation number] Does the U64 wrapper properly validate against negative values or malformed input that could be interpreted as very large positive numbers after deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [MoveStructTag bypass] Can an attacker craft a malicious MoveStructTag that passes the verify(0) check but contains deeply nested generics causing stack overflow in Account::find_event_key() or resource deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Recursive type bomb] Can the event_handle.0.verify(0) call at line 125 be bypassed with recursive type definitions that exceed recursion limits only after passing initial validation, causing API crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker supply a valid MoveStructTag for a different struct type that happens to have an event handle field with the same name, accessing events from unintended resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Generic parameter manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate type parameters in the MoveStructTag to access event handles from CoinStore<AttackerCoin> instead of CoinStore<AptosCoin>, bypassing access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Module address spoofing] Can an attacker craft a MoveStructTag with a different module address that resolves to a malicious contract with similar structure, extracting sensitive event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Field name injection] Can verify_field_identifier() at line 130 be bypassed with unicode normalization attacks, zero-width characters, or homoglyph attacks to access unintended fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Path traversal] Can field_name contain path traversal sequences (../, ./, etc.) that bypass validation and access nested struct fields or parent struct data not intended for event queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Reserved identifiers] Does verify_field_identifier properly reject Move reserved keywords or system field names that could grant access to internal runtime structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Field name length] Can an extremely long field_name cause buffer overflow in downstream BCS deserialization or storage lookups in Account::find_event_key()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_handle()] [Null byte injection] Can field_name contain null bytes that pass IdentifierWrapper validation but cause truncation in C-interop layers or storage queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Limit bypass] Can an attacker set limit parameter to 0, causing Page::new() to create invalid pagination that bypasses max_events_page_size enforcement and returns unlimited events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/events.rs] [Function: get_events_by_creation_number()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly request the maximum limit value across multiple creation_numbers to exhaust node memory or cause OOM, degrading API availability? (Medium)",
