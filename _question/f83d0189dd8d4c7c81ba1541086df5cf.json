  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Function: generate_html_report()] [CPU DoS] Can an attacker trigger report generation on extremely complex gas logs with millions of operations, causing CPU exhaustion on validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 334-347] [Traversal DoS] Can the preorder_traversel operation be exploited with maliciously crafted deeply nested trees to cause stack overflow or excessive CPU usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 349-350] [String Building] Can the incremental string building in render_table with massive tables cause repeated reallocations and memory fragmentation, degrading system performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Multiple locations] [Rounding Errors] Can cumulative rounding errors in percentage calculations cause the total percentages to exceed 100% or be significantly less, indicating calculation bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 115-118, 130-133, 150-151] [Inconsistent Precision] Are percentage calculations using consistent precision (.2%), or can inconsistencies between different sections cause confusion or hide cost anomalies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 171] [Percentage Format] Does the {:.2}% formatting properly handle edge cases like costs that are 0.001% or 99.999%, ensuring accurate representation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Function: fmt_storage_fee] [Closure Safety] Can the fmt_storage_fee closure be invoked with Fee values that cause overflow, underflow, or precision loss during the scaling division? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Function: fmt_storage_fee_percentage] [Division Guard] Does the conditional check for storage.total.is_zero() cover all code paths, or can the closure be invoked in contexts where the check is bypassed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 220-224] [Hardcoded Hit Count] Why is the transaction_write hit count hardcoded to 1, and can this be manipulated to misrepresent transaction costs in aggregated reports? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 4-5] [Import Security] Can vulnerabilities in imported crates (TransactionGasLog, Render, InternalGas, Fee) propagate into this report generation code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 7] [Handlebars Vulnerabilities] Does the code use a specific pinned version of Handlebars, or could it be vulnerable to known template injection or DoS issues in certain Handlebars versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/report.rs] [Lines: 8] [Serde JSON Security] Can malicious data structures cause vulnerabilities in serde_json serialization, such as stack overflow with deeply nested objects or infinite loops? (Low)"
