  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker who gains control of the build process or repository modify LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION to point to an older gas_feature_versions constant, causing all new deployments to use outdated gas schedules and creating network splits between old and new validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Consensus divergence] If LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION is set to gas_feature_versions::RELEASE_V1_39 (value 43), but some validators compile with an older version pointing to RELEASE_V1_38, will this cause deterministic execution differences leading to consensus failures and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Missing version] The changelog shows V13 was skipped due to 'testnet mis-operation' - can an attacker exploit gaps in version numbering by crafting on-chain gas schedules with version 13 to bypass validation checks that assume consecutive versioning, potentially causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Integer overflow] Can the u64 version values (currently up to 43) overflow if incremented for many years, and would such overflow cause gas metering to fail catastrophically, enabling free transaction execution or total network halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Version collision] Are there any checks preventing duplicate version values across different RELEASE_V1_XX constants? Could a developer accidentally assign RELEASE_V1_40 the same value as RELEASE_V1_39 (43), causing ambiguous version resolution and unpredictable gas charging behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Downgrade attack] The on-chain gas_schedule.move validates that new_gas_schedule.feature_version >= cur_gas_schedule.feature_version, but if LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION in compiled validators is lower than the on-chain version, can this create a situation where validators cannot process governance proposals, leading to governance deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Version mismatch] If a governance proposal sets the on-chain gas schedule to feature_version 50 but the compiled LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION is still 43, will validators crash, skip transactions, or apply incorrect gas calculations, potentially allowing unlimited free transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Genesis initialization] During genesis via initialize(), if the gas_schedule_blob contains a feature_version higher than LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION compiled into the initial validator set, can this cause immediate consensus failure at network launch or allow initialization with incompatible gas parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Upgrade race condition] If different validators update their binary to include RELEASE_V1_40 at different times during an epoch, can this cause non-deterministic gas calculations for the same transactions, leading to state divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Feature gate bypass] The changelog indicates V31 added 'Gas charging for modules used in type tags' - if an attacker finds a way to manipulate the gas_feature_version check to report version 30 instead of 31, can they exploit type tag module loading without gas charges to perform DoS attacks with complex type hierarchies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [BLS cryptography exploit] V8 added BLS12-381 operations and V12 added BN254 operations - if gas_feature_version reporting is manipulated to show version 7, would expensive cryptographic operations become free or underpriced, enabling computational DoS attacks against validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Refundable bytes exploit] V14 introduced refundable state bytes gated by flag REFUNDABLE_BYTES - if an attacker can force execution with gas_feature_version 13, can they bypass refund logic to permanently lock storage fees or exploit non-refundable byte accounting to drain the gas economy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Storage fee manipulation] V7 introduced 'New formulae for storage fees based on fixed APT costs' - can an attacker exploit version inconsistencies to apply V6 storage formulas while claiming V7 validation, potentially creating arbitrage opportunities or economic attacks on storage pricing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Keyless authentication bypass] V17 added gas for keyless authentication - if gas_feature_version is manipulated to report version 16, would keyless authentication operations become free, enabling Sybil attacks or authentication spam that exhausts validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Constant: LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] [Non-deterministic execution] If LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION is used as a default when on-chain gas schedule is unavailable (e.g., during state sync), can different validators with different compiled versions execute transactions with different gas costs, violating deterministic execution and causing consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Epoch boundary exploit] During epoch reconfiguration when gas schedules are updated via on_new_epoch(), if new validators join with older LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION constants, can they reject valid blocks from validators using newer gas versions, causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Aggregator v2 inconsistency] V12 and V19 introduced aggregator v2 gas charges - if validators disagree on which gas_feature_version applies to aggregator operations, can this cause non-deterministic state updates in high-contention parallel execution scenarios, breaking state commitment consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Memory quota divergence] V3 added memory quota - if gas_feature_version checks are inconsistent, can some validators apply memory limits while others don't, causing valid transactions to be rejected by subset of validators and breaking consensus quorum requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Python script: bump_ver.py] [Automated version corruption] The bump_ver.py script automatically increments versions - can malicious modifications to the script cause it to skip version numbers, create duplicate values, or corrupt the gas_feature_versions module, leading to deployment of invalid version configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Python script: bump_ver.py] [Regex injection] The bump_ver.py script uses regex to parse and modify ver.rs - can specially crafted comments or formatting in ver.rs cause the regex to incorrectly update version numbers, potentially setting LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION to a non-existent or wrong constant? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Python script: bump_ver.py] [Missing validation] Does bump_ver.py validate that the new version value is exactly latest_value + 1? If not, can manual editing or script errors cause version numbers to jump (e.g., from 43 to 45), breaking assumptions in version comparison logic throughout the codebase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Gas underpricing exploit] V10 changed storage gas to stop respecting curves - if an attacker can trigger execution with gas_feature_version 9, can they exploit the old curve-based pricing to perform storage operations at significantly lower costs than intended, economically attacking the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Free write quota bypass] V5 introduced free_write_bytes_quota and V12 changed IO gas to ignore it - can version manipulation allow attackers to exploit the free quota in V5-V11 while bypassing V12+ restrictions, enabling subsidized storage spam? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Write ops limit bypass] V11 added 'Hard limit on the number of write ops per transaction' - can forcing execution with gas_feature_version 10 bypass this limit to perform unlimited write operations in a single transaction, causing state bloat and consensus slowdowns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/ver.rs] [Module: gas_feature_versions] [Event cost manipulation] V16 added 'IO Gas for the transaction itself and events in the transaction output' - can version inconsistencies allow attackers to emit unlimited events without proper gas charges, flooding storage and creating indexing DoS? (Medium)"
