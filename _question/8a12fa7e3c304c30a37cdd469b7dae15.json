  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: construct_test_plan()] [Null Pointer/Options Bypass] Can an attacker trigger a panic by calling construct_test_plan() when the Options extension is not properly initialized, causing the expect() call to fail and crash the compiler, resulting in denial of service during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: construct_test_plan()] [Filter Bypass] Can a malicious module bypass the is_primary_target() filter by manipulating module metadata, causing non-target modules with malicious test attributes to be processed and potentially execute unintended test code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: construct_test_plan()] [Package Filter Manipulation] Does the package_filter parameter properly validate against malicious Symbol values, or can an attacker provide a crafted Symbol that matches unintended packages and exposes internal test logic?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: construct_module_test_plan()] [Identifier Creation Panic] Can an attacker provide a module name that causes Identifier::new() to panic on invalid characters, crashing the compiler and causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: construct_module_test_plan()] [BTreeMap Collision] Can duplicate function names in the BTreeMap silently overwrite earlier test cases, causing critical test validation to be skipped for security-sensitive functions? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Attribute Collision Attack] Can an attacker define multiple #[test] attributes on the same function to cause the find() iterator to return inconsistent results, bypassing test validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Expected Failure on Non-Test] Can an attacker annotate non-test functions with #[expected_failure] to bypass the error check when test_attribute_opt is None, potentially hiding security vulnerabilities in production code?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Test/TestOnly Conflict] Does the validation for mutually exclusive #[test] and #[test_only] attributes properly handle all edge cases, or can certain attribute ordering bypass the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Parameter Type Confusion] Can an attacker provide test parameters with Address values that get incorrectly converted to Signer types when the actual parameter expects a different type, causing type safety violations during test execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Missing Parameter Silent Failure] When a test parameter is missing from test_annotation_params, does the error reporting prevent compilation, or can tests proceed with uninitialized parameters causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/plan_builder.rs] [Function: build_test_info()] [Reference Type Bypass] Can an attacker provide parameters with Type::Reference wrapping non-Signer types to bypass the signer validation check and inject arbitrary reference types into tests? (Medium)",
