  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [ReliableBroadcast state] At lines 227-235, ReliableBroadcast is created with rb_backoff_policy but stores state for all validators - can this state grow unbounded as more broadcasts are initiated, causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Field: ongoing_tasks] [Ordering semantics] At line 144, ongoing_tasks is AtomicU64 but operations use Ordering::SeqCst - can weaker ordering like Relaxed cause reset() to observe stale ongoing_tasks count, completing reset while tasks are still running? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Field: reset_flag] [Flag usage] At line 154, reset_flag is AtomicBool but never read in buffer_manager.rs - can external components check this flag and see stale value due to memory ordering, causing race with reset operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Function: create_new_request()] [Counter increment] At line 290, ongoing_tasks.clone() creates new Arc but CountedRequest increments the same counter - can Clone implementation create subtle bugs where counter is incremented multiple times for single request? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Field: previous_commit_time] [Non-atomic read/write] At lines 153, 251, 536, 562, previous_commit_time is Instant with non-atomic updates - can race between read in rebroadcast_commit_votes_if_needed() and write in advance_head() cause incorrect elapsed time calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_manager.rs] [Field: stop] [Non-atomic flag] At line 140, stop is bool not atomic - can race between setting stop in process_reset_request() and reading in start() loop cause missed stop signal and validator running indefinitely? (Medium)"
