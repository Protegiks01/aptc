  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Selective validation] A Byzantine validator could selectively call verify() only for messages it wants to accept - without mandatory verification enforcement at the protocol layer, can this enable accepting invalid shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Enum: SecretShareMessage] [Dealer identification] The SecretShareMessage enum doesn't include explicit dealer identification - can a Byzantine validator send Share messages claiming to be from other dealers, and is dealer authentication handled elsewhere or missing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Threshold enforcement] While verify() checks individual share validity at line 36, does it enforce that shares come from authorized dealers in the validator set, or can unauthorized nodes generate shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Broadcast manipulation] If a Byzantine validator controls the reliable broadcast mechanism at line 41, can they selectively deliver SecretShareMessages to some validators but not others, creating network partitions in the randomness protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Enum: SecretShareMessage] [Share withholding] Can a Byzantine dealer send RequestShare messages but refuse to send Share responses, causing the randomness protocol to stall or fail to reach threshold, affecting leader election fairness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Biased shares] If share.verify() at line 36 only checks cryptographic validity but not randomness properties (e.g., share commitment matches), can Byzantine dealers contribute biased shares to influence the final random output? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Enum: SecretShareMessage] [Contribution fairness] With no visible contribution tracking in SecretShareMessage, can a Byzantine validator contribute multiple shares to the same randomness instance, giving them disproportionate influence over the final beacon? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Threshold calculation] The SecretShareConfig at line 31 contains threshold parameters - can Byzantine validators manipulate threshold values or share counts to cause the protocol to accept insufficient shares, reducing randomness quality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Type: RequestSecretShare] [External dependency] RequestSecretShare type at line 6 is imported from types module - can vulnerabilities in RequestSecretShare structure (e.g., missing validation, integer overflows) be exploited through SecretShareMessage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Type: SecretShare] [Cryptographic dependency] SecretShare at line 14 from aptos_types may have its own verify() implementation - if that has bugs (e.g., signature malleability, weak randomness checks), does this file have defense in depth? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Type: EpochState] [Epoch state trust] EpochState passed to verify() at line 30 may contain validator set and configuration - can corrupted or manipulated EpochState objects cause incorrect validation results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Trait: TConsensusMsg] [Consensus message integration] The TConsensusMsg trait implementation suggests integration with broader consensus messaging - can type confusion between different ConsensusMsg variants at line 52 cause messages to be processed by wrong handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Import: ConsensusMsg] [Message routing] ConsensusMsg enum at line 5 may have multiple variants - can attackers exploit message routing logic to deliver SecretShareMsg to components that don't properly validate them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Config immutability] Is SecretShareConfig at line 31 immutable during verification, or can concurrent config updates cause TOCTOU vulnerabilities where share verification uses stale or inconsistent parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Metadata extraction] For Share messages, epoch comes from share.metadata.epoch at line 47 - can the metadata structure be manipulated to contain different epoch values than the actual share data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Struct: SecretShareNetworkMessage] [Epoch redundancy] Epoch is stored both in SecretShareNetworkMessage (line 68) and inner SecretShareMessage - are these always consistent, and can discrepancies cause validation bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Struct: SecretShareRpc] [RPC timeout] SecretShareRpc at line 96 has no timeout field - can slow or malicious responders cause RPC calls to hang indefinitely, affecting consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Struct: SecretShareRpc] [Error encoding] The response_sender returns Result<Bytes, RpcError> at line 99 - can error responses be crafted to cause crashes or bypass error handling in the caller? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: into_network_message()] [Message size] The BCS serialization at line 61 produces variable-size output - are there network-layer size limits, and can oversized messages cause transmission failures or truncation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Derive: EnumConversion] [Conversion safety] Line 21 derives EnumConversion for SecretShareMessage - can the auto-generated conversion code introduce vulnerabilities like incorrect variant mappings or missing validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Timing side channel] Does share.verify() at line 36 have constant-time implementation, or can timing differences leak information about share validity, enabling adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks on the secret sharing scheme? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Read atomicity] Accessing share.metadata.epoch at line 47 may not be atomic - can torn reads in multi-threaded scenarios cause corrupted epoch values to be returned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Struct: SecretShareRpc] [Response ordering] If multiple SecretShareRpc instances are processed concurrently, can out-of-order responses cause validators to aggregate shares in wrong order, affecting randomness output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Struct: SecretShareNetworkMessage] [Vec reallocation] The data Vec<u8> at line 70 may reallocate during growth - can message construction patterns cause excessive memory fragmentation or allocation churn? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: data()] [Lifetime safety] The data() method at line 78 returns &[u8] with lifetime tied to self - can callers unsafely extend this lifetime causing use-after-free if the parent struct is dropped? (Low)"
