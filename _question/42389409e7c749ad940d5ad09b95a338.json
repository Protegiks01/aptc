  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: CertifiedNodeSchema key] [Preimage attack] Can an attacker find a preimage for a HashValue key to forge CertifiedNode entries for nodes they didn't create? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: CertifiedNodeSchema key] [Second preimage] Can an attacker create a different CertifiedNode that hashes to the same HashValue as a legitimate node, allowing substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Function: CertifiedNode::encode_value()] [Signature malleability] Can BCS encoding of aggregated signatures be malleable, allowing attackers to create different serializations of the same signature that cause storage inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: DagVoteSchema] [Signature replay] Can individual Vote signatures be extracted from storage and replayed in different contexts where they weren't intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [All schemas] [Weak hash function] Does the codebase use cryptographically strong hash functions for all digest calculations, or could hash collision attacks be practical? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: NodeSchema] [DAG structure corruption] Can storing nodes out-of-order or with missing parents corrupt the DAG structure, preventing consensus from making progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: CertifiedNodeSchema] [Orphan nodes] Can certified nodes be stored without their parent nodes being present, creating orphaned DAG vertices that break topological ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: DagVoteSchema] [Vote-node mismatch] Can votes be stored for NodeIds that don't correspond to any stored Node, wasting storage and potentially causing vote counting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [All schemas] [Circular references] Can malicious DAG construction create circular parent references that cause infinite loops when traversing the DAG from storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: CertifiedNodeSchema] [Double certification] Can the same node be certified multiple times with different signature sets, and does the schema prevent or detect this? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Function: NodeId::decode_key()] [Decode error handling] Does decode_key at line 54-56 properly handle malformed BCS data, or can it panic causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Function: Vote::decode_value()] [Corruption detection] When Vote deserialization fails at line 64, can the system detect and recover from corrupted vote data, or does it cause permanent consensus halt? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Function: CertifiedNode::decode_value()] [Recovery mechanism] If CertifiedNode deserialization fails at line 93, is there a recovery mechanism to re-certify the node, or is the data permanently lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [All decode functions] [Partial failure] Can decode failures in one schema (e.g., NodeSchema) cascade to failures in dependent schemas (e.g., CertifiedNodeSchema), causing total consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [All encode functions] [Write failure handling] Do encode operations properly handle disk-full or I/O errors, or can failed writes leave the database in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: NodeSchema with unit key] [Single entry limitation] Since NodeSchema uses `()` as key, does this mean only one Node can be stored globally, making the schema fundamentally broken for DAG consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: DagVoteSchema] [Key uniqueness] Does NodeId provide sufficient uniqueness as a key, or can epoch/round/author combinations collide across validator set changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensusdb/schema/dag/mod.rs] [Schema: CertifiedNodeSchema] [Key selection] Is HashValue the optimal key for CertifiedNodeSchema, or could NodeId provide better query patterns and avoid hash collision risks? (Medium)",
