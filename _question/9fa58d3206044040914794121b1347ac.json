  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Global Mutable State] If ErrorMapping is stored as global mutable state, can multiple Move modules or transactions modify it concurrently, causing race conditions or allowing attackers to inject malicious error codes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [No Integrity Protection] Does the error map file written by to_file() include any cryptographic signature or hash to verify integrity, or can an attacker tamper with the file to inject false error descriptions without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Missing Signature Verification] If error maps are distributed across the network, does from_file() verify a cryptographic signature before loading, or can malicious peers distribute fake error maps that cause validators to misinterpret consensus errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Hash Collision in BTreeMap] Can an attacker craft module names or category IDs that create hash collisions in the BTreeMap's internal structure, degrading lookup performance to O(n) and causing DoS during error reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: to_file()] [Plaintext Storage] Are error descriptions stored in plaintext in the BCS-encoded file, potentially leaking sensitive information about unreleased features or vulnerability details in error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Gas Cost Inconsistency] If get_explanation() is called during transaction execution and charged gas, can variations in error map size across validators cause inconsistent gas costs for the same transaction, breaking deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [No Gas Metering] If get_explanation() performs expensive lookups but isn't gas-metered, can an attacker craft transactions that abort frequently, causing validators to spend excessive CPU on error lookups without paying gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [State Bloat] If error maps are stored in global state and grow without bounds, can this contribute to state bloat, increasing storage costs for all validators and potentially making full nodes infeasible to run? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Initialization Cost] If add_module_error() is called during module initialization and the cost is charged to module publishers, can attackers drain publisher gas by forcing them to register thousands of error codes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorDescription] [Log Injection] If code_description contains newlines or special characters, can error messages be injected into validator logs to obscure real errors or inject fake log entries during incident response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Information Disclosure] Do error descriptions returned by get_explanation() leak sensitive implementation details (private key algorithms, consensus internals) that could aid attackers in crafting targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorDescription] [Debug Information Leakage] Does ErrorDescription's Debug trait implementation at line 14 leak sensitive information when error maps are logged, potentially exposing module internals to log monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_error_category()] [Verbose Error Messages] Do the bail!() error messages at lines 37-40 include the full previous_entry details, potentially logging sensitive error descriptions that were supposed to be internal-only? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Verbose Error Messages] Do the bail!() error messages at lines 56-59 include the full previous_entry details, potentially exposing internal error codes that could aid attackers in reverse-engineering module logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_error_category()] [Empty Description] Can an attacker register error categories with empty code_name or code_description strings, causing validators to display blank error messages that provide no debugging information during critical failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [Empty Module Name] What happens if add_module_error() is called with an empty string for module_name at line 48 - does it create a nameless module entry that breaks error lookups or causes all modules to collide? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Empty Module Name] If get_explanation() is called with an empty module_name string, does it match the entry created by empty module names, or does it return None causing legitimate errors to be unreported? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Empty Map Semantics] If ErrorMapping is created with Default at line 22 and never populated, do all error lookups return None, causing a complete loss of error diagnostics that could mask critical consensus bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: get_explanation()] [Null Character Handling] If module_name contains null bytes or is null-terminated, does the string comparison at line 78 match correctly, or can null bytes cause premature string termination and lookup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: add_module_error()] [to_owned() Cost] Does the to_owned() call at line 53 create a deep copy of the module name string for every error registration, and can this cause excessive memory allocation during module initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Clone Semantics] Does the Clone trait at line 22 perform a deep copy of all BTreeMaps and strings, and can cloning large error maps cause memory spikes or performance degradation during validator startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Struct: ErrorMapping] [Consensus Divergence] If two validators have different ErrorMapping contents due to loading different versions of error map files, can this cause them to interpret the same transaction abort differently, leading to state divergence and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/errmap.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Byzantine Validator Attack] Can a Byzantine validator load a corrupted error map file that causes it to misreport consensus errors, potentially confusing other validators and causing incorrect timeout/view change decisions?
