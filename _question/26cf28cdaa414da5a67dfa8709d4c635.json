  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: ok_result(), err_result()] [Module boundary exploitation] Can these helper functions be called directly by user Move code, or are they only accessible to native functions? If accessible, can user code create invalid Result values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Native function bridge] When native functions use these helpers to pass Result values back to Move code, are type signatures properly validated at the boundary to prevent type confusion attacks? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Non-deterministic unpacking] Are unpack_with_tag() operations deterministic across all validators, or can differences in iterator implementation or memory ordering cause validators to extract different values from the same Result? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: is_ok_result_ref()] [Reference determinism] Does is_ok_result_ref() produce deterministic boolean results across all validators, or can race conditions in reference handling cause different nodes to see different Ok/Err states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: ok_result()] [State serialization] When Result values created by ok_result() are serialized to storage, can the serialization format introduce ambiguities that allow Result::Ok to be deserialized as Result::Err? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Error state corruption] If unwrap_result() or unwrap_err_result() encounters an error and returns PartialVMError, can this leave the transaction in a partially-executed state that corrupts the global state?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: ok_result(), err_result()] [Resource duplication] Can the combination of ok_result() and unwrap_result() be used to duplicate Move resources by wrapping them in Results, unwrapping them, while still keeping the original Struct? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Constants: OK_VARIANT, ERR_VARIANT] [Enum variant collision] Are these variant indices guaranteed unique across all enum types in Move stdlib, or can other enums (like Option) share the same variant values causing cross-type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Parallel execution race] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent calls to unwrap_result() on the same Result value cause race conditions that violate transaction isolation?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: ok_result()] [Empty value handling] Can ok_result() be called with Value::Invalid or other invalid Value variants, and does it properly reject these instead of creating corrupted Result values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: err_result()] [Unit type errors] Can err_result() wrap a unit type () as the error value, and does this cause issues when unwrap_err_result() tries to extract it? (Medium)",
