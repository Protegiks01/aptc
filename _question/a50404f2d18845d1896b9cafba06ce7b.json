  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Integration] [Immutability Violation] Are PackageIdentity fields truly immutable after construction, or can unsafe code or interior mutability patterns allow post-construction modifications that violate caching assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Type Safety] [Enum Variant Confusion] Can unsafe code or incorrect pattern matching cause SourceLocation enum variant confusion, treating a Local path as a Git repo or vice versa, leading to code execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Type Safety] [AccountAddress Type Confusion] Is AccountAddress properly validated to be 32 bytes, or can type conversions allow arbitrary-length addresses that cause buffer overflows in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Memory Safety] [Unbounded Growth] Can an attacker cause unbounded memory growth by creating extremely large numbers of unique PackageIdentity instances through automation, exhausting validator memory? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Memory Safety] [Drop Handler] Does PackageIdentity have a custom Drop implementation that could panic or cause double-free if cleanup fails, potentially corrupting package resolver state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Subdir] Can the Git variant have an empty NormalizedPath for subdir, and does this correctly resolve to repository root or cause path resolution errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Commit ID] Can git2::Oid be all zeros (null OID), and does this cause git operations to fail or unexpectedly match the repository state before any commits? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Edge Case] [Special AccountAddress Values] Are special AccountAddress values (0x0, 0x1, MAX) handled correctly, or do they cause panics/errors when used as package addresses in OnChain sources? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode Package Names] Can package names contain Unicode, emoji, or control characters that cause display corruption, filesystem errors, or break tooling assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic on Format] Can fmt_strip_root_path() panic if the Write implementation returns an error, causing unwinding that corrupts package resolver state or breaks consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Move Integration] [Module Resolution] Can PackageIdentity be exploited to resolve wrong Move modules during compilation, causing type confusion or access control bypass in deployed contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Move Integration] [Address Derivation] If package addresses are derived from PackageIdentity, can attackers cause collisions or predictability that allows them to precompute deployment addresses for attacks? (High)"
