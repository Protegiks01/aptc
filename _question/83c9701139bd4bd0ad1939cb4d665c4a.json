  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/metrics.rs] [Usage pattern] [Amplification attack] Can an attacker craft transactions that create objects requiring drop operations with exponentially increasing metric overhead, amplifying resource consumption beyond the transaction's gas cost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/metrics.rs] [Line: 13] [Time series explosion] With two label dimensions ['helper_name', 'name'], can an attacker create N*M unique time series that overwhelm Prometheus storage and querying, causing monitoring system failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/metrics.rs] [Overall design] [Single point of failure] Since all drop helpers share the same global TIMER and GAUGE metrics, can corruption or poisoning of these metrics affect all drop operations system-wide? (Medium)"
