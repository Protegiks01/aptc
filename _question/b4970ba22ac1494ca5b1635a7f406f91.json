  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Partition flag manipulation] Can inconsistent partition_last_round values across validators cause some to extract global_txns and others not, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Round count mismatch] If final_num_rounds differs from the expected number of rounds, can this cause misalignment in dependency calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Global txns ordering] Are transactions in global_txns properly ordered relative to sharded_txns, or can reordering cause execution consistency violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Timing attack] Can the timer at line 20 leak timing information that allows attackers to infer transaction patterns or validator behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Performance degradation] If parallel processing takes excessively long due to lock contention, can this cause consensus timeouts and liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Panic propagation] If unwrap() at line 49 panics in one parallel thread, does it properly terminate all other threads or leave them running with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Error handling] Are there any recoverable error cases that should be handled instead of using unwrap(), preventing unnecessary validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Graceful degradation] If parallel processing fails, can the system fall back to sequential processing, or is the validator permanently crashed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [State mutation] Can state.sub_block_matrix be mutated by external code while add_edges() is executing, causing race conditions? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [State version] Does the function check that state version/epoch hasn't changed during execution, preventing stale state usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/build_edge.rs] [Function: add_edges()] [Dependency completeness] Does take_txn_with_dep() capture ALL required dependencies, or can missing edges allow race conditions in parallel execution? (Critical)",
