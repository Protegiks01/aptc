  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Weak Hash Function] Does the HashValue type for first_key/last_key use a cryptographically secure hash function, or could birthday attacks create collisions allowing attacker to substitute chunk data?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Proof Malleability] Can the SparseMerkleRangeProof be modified to have multiple valid serializations, allowing an attacker to present different proofs for the same chunk that all verify correctly?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Zero-Length Range] Can first_idx == last_idx create a single-element chunk, and if validation assumes multi-element chunks, could this bypass proof verification requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Index Discontinuity] If chunk N's last_idx + 1 != chunk N+1's first_idx, can the gap cause account indices to be renumbered incorrectly during restoration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Total Count Mismatch] If the sum of all chunk ranges (last_idx - first_idx + 1) doesn't match the expected total account count, can this indicate missing or duplicate data that goes undetected?
