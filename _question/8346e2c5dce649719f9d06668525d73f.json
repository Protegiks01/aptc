  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/checkpoint/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Validation] Does the code validate that the db_dir actually exists and is readable before attempting checkpoint creation, or could error messages leak information about filesystem structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/checkpoint/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Privilege Escalation] If this command is run with elevated privileges, can an attacker exploit the checkpoint creation to gain access to or modify files they shouldn't have access to through hardlink manipulation? (High)",
