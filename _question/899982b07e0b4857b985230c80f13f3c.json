  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Attack: Type confusion via unsafe] If any code (including native functions or other extensions) uses unsafe blocks to transmute types, can this create fake extensions that pass TypeId checks but have incorrect memory layout, causing memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Attack: Panic-based state freezing] Can malicious transactions deliberately trigger panics in extension lifecycle methods (start/finish/abort) at strategic points to freeze validator state in partially-committed configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Edge case: Empty extensions] Does the VM handle NativeContextExtensions with zero extensions correctly, or can empty extension sets cause null pointer dereferences or other issues in for_each_mut()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Edge case: Maximum extensions] Is there a limit on the number of extensions that can be added? Can exceeding HashMap capacity or memory limits cause allocation failures that crash validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Edge case: Zero-sized types] Can extensions with zero-sized types (ZSTs) cause issues with Box allocation, HashMap storage, or downcast operations that assume non-zero sizes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Edge case: Session counter overflow] When session_counter reaches 255 and wraps around to 0, can this create session ID collisions with earlier sessions that haven't been cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Comment accuracy] Do the comments at lines 8-14 accurately describe the session lifecycle, or can misunderstandings lead to incorrect usage that corrupts state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Test coverage] Do the tests at lines 118-141 adequately cover security-critical scenarios like concurrent access, panic safety, and edge cases, or are there untested attack vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [API evolution] If new methods are added to the SessionListener trait, how are existing extensions updated? Can version mismatches between extension implementations and VM expectations cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Dependency: better_any] Does the better_any crate have known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the Tid/TidAble trait usage in this file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Dependency: better_any] Can malicious updates to the better_any crate compromise type safety and enable arbitrary code execution through manipulated TypeId values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Extension behavior] [Stateful extensions] If extensions maintain internal state across multiple sessions, can state leakage between transactions from different senders enable information disclosure or cross-account attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Extension behavior] [Extension initialization] Are extensions properly initialized before first use, or can accessing an extension immediately after add() expose uninitialized memory or trigger undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Extension behavior] [Extension cleanup] When abort() is called, are extensions required to return to a specific canonical state, or can improper cleanup leave extensions in inconsistent states that affect future transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/native_extensions.rs] [Extension behavior] [Cross-session state] Can extensions use static variables or other global state to communicate between sessions, bypassing the intended isolation and enabling covert channels or cross-transaction attacks? (High)"
