  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Testnet Isolation Breach] Can URLs generated by this function be manipulated to connect to services outside the local testnet environment, breaking the isolation guarantees expected for local development and testing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Node Impersonation] If multiple local testnet nodes use this function to generate their API URLs, can an attacker craft socket addresses that collide with or impersonate other nodes' URLs, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Configuration Injection] Can this function be exploited to inject malicious URLs into local testnet configuration files or environment variables that are later used for critical operations like validator communication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [TOCTOU Race] If the socket_addr parameter is derived from a shared mutable state, can attackers exploit time-of-check-time-of-use races where the address changes between validation and URL construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Concurrent URL Generation] If multiple threads call this function concurrently with overlapping socket addresses, can this lead to race conditions or inconsistent URL generation affecting local testnet behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Reference Lifetime] Does the function correctly handle the lifetime of the socket_addr reference parameter, or can dangling references lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities in unsafe code that calls this function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Type Confusion] Can the SocketAddr enum matching on lines 9-12 be exploited through type confusion if unsafe code constructs invalid SocketAddr variants that don't match V4 or V6? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Authority Parsing] After URL construction, can attackers exploit ambiguities in how the authority component (host:port) is parsed to inject userinfo (username:password@) or other authority elements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Path Traversal Setup] Does the constructed URL allow path components to be appended by callers, and if so, can this enable path traversal attacks (../../) when the URL is used to access local testnet resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Query Parameter Injection] Even though this function doesn't add query parameters, can the base URL be constructed in a way that enables query parameter injection when callers append parameters to access local testnet APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [TLS/HTTPS Confusion] If the scheme is set to 'https' but the local testnet doesn't properly configure TLS, can this create false security expectations where unencrypted traffic is believed to be encrypted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Authentication Bypass] Can URLs generated by this function be used to bypass authentication mechanisms if the local testnet assumes all connections from localhost URLs are trusted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [CORS Misconfiguration] Do URLs generated from localhost addresses cause Cross-Origin Resource Sharing misconfigurations where local testnet APIs accept requests from unexpected origins? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Null Byte Injection] Can the scheme parameter contain null bytes (\\0) that truncate the URL string in certain contexts while appearing valid in others, enabling injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Newline Injection] If the scheme contains newline characters (\\n or \\r\\n), can this enable HTTP request smuggling or response splitting when the URL is used in HTTP operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Control Character Injection] Can control characters (0x00-0x1F) in the scheme parameter cause parsing ambiguities or injection vulnerabilities in downstream URL consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Empty Scheme] What happens if the scheme parameter is an empty string - does Url::parse() fail gracefully or produce a malformed URL like '://host:port' that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Extremely Long Scheme] Can an attacker provide an extremely long scheme string that causes buffer overflow, excessive memory allocation, or denial of service during URL construction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Unspecified IPv6 Address] If socket_addr contains the unspecified IPv6 address (::), does this create security issues where connections bind to all interfaces instead of just local testnet interfaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Loopback] Does the function properly handle IPv6 loopback address (::1), and can attackers exploit differences in how IPv4 (127.0.0.1) vs IPv6 (::1) loopback are treated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [WebSocket Upgrade] If the scheme is 'ws' or 'wss', can this enable WebSocket-specific attacks against local testnet APIs that aren't designed to handle WebSocket connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Protocol Downgrade] Can an attacker force the scheme to 'http' when 'https' is expected, enabling protocol downgrade attacks that expose local testnet traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Custom Scheme Abuse] Does the function restrict schemes to known protocols, or can custom schemes be injected that are handled differently by various URL consumers in the codebase? (Low)"
