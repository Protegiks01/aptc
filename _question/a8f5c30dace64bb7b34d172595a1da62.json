  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with excessively large vector lengths that cause memory exhaustion during deserialization, potentially crashing validator nodes or causing denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Does the BCS deserialization validate that the `typ` field in PropertyValue matches the actual type of data in the `value` bytes, or can an attacker deserialize mismatched types (e.g., typ='u64' but value contains string data) to cause undefined behavior or exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Can malicious BCS input specify vector lengths that overflow when multiplied during memory allocation (e.g., keys.len() * size_of::<String>()), causing undersized allocations and subsequent buffer overflows? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Nested vector attack] Can deeply nested OptionType<PropertyValue> structures in BCS input cause stack overflow during recursive deserialization, crashing the node or enabling RCE through stack manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Duplicate key attack] Does deserialization check for duplicate entries in the `keys` vector, or can an attacker include duplicate keys to cause inconsistent state or bypass validation logic that assumes unique keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [State inconsistency] Does the constructor or any validation enforce that keys.len() == old_values.len() == new_values.len(), or can an attacker create events with mismatched vector lengths causing out-of-bounds access when indexing these arrays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] The new() constructor accepts keys, old_values, and new_values without any length validation - can this allow creation of invalid events that violate the invariant that these three vectors must have equal length, leading to panics or undefined behavior in consumers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide extremely large but equal-length vectors (e.g., 2^32 elements each) that cause integer overflow when calculating total memory usage or when iterating with index arithmetic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Empty vector attack] Are there checks preventing all three vectors (keys, old_values, new_values) from being empty, which could represent a meaningless mutation event that bypasses validation or wastes storage/gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Length mismatch exploitation] If deserialization succeeds with mismatched vector lengths, can this be exploited to cause the Move VM to access out-of-bounds indices when processing property mutations, potentially corrupting blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: collection] [Collection name validation] Is there any validation on the `collection` string to prevent excessively long names, special characters, or control characters that could cause storage bloat, indexing issues, or SQL injection in downstream systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: token] [Token name validation] Can an attacker specify arbitrarily long `token` strings (e.g., multi-megabyte names) that consume excessive storage, memory, or gas when emitting events, potentially causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: keys] [Key name validation] Are there restrictions on property key names in the `keys` vector to prevent reserved keywords, system property names, or names containing null bytes that could cause parsing errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: collection/token] [Unicode normalization attack] Can an attacker create multiple collections or tokens with visually identical but canonically different Unicode strings (e.g., 'café' vs 'café' with different combining characters) to cause collision attacks or bypass uniqueness checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: keys] [Duplicate property keys] Does any consumer of this event assume unique keys, and can providing duplicate keys in the same mutation event cause inconsistent state updates or allow attackers to bypass property mutation restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: collection/token] [Empty string attack] Are empty strings allowed for collection or token names, which could cause issues with event indexing, querying, or create ambiguity in the token identity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: keys] [Control character injection] Can keys contain control characters (newlines, tabs, null bytes) that break event parsing, logging systems, or cause injection vulnerabilities in off-chain indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Type-value mismatch] The PropertyValue has a `typ` string and raw `value` bytes without validation - can an attacker claim typ='address' but provide non-address bytes, causing type confusion when the value is interpreted by Move contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Invalid type string] Is there validation that `typ` matches a known Move type (u8, u64, u128, bool, address, string, vector)? Can arbitrary type strings cause crashes, bypasses, or undefined behavior in Move VM or property validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Oversized value attack] Can the `value` Vec<u8> be arbitrarily large (e.g., gigabytes) causing memory exhaustion when deserializing or processing property mutations, potentially DoSing validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Empty value exploitation] For non-optional types, can an attacker provide empty `value` vectors that should be invalid (e.g., empty bytes for u64), bypassing validation and causing unexpected behavior when consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Type string case sensitivity] Is the `typ` field case-sensitive? Can an attacker use 'U64' or 'Address' to bypass type checks that expect lowercase 'u64' or 'address', causing security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Canonical type representation] Can attackers use alternative type representations (e.g., '0x1::string::String' vs 'string') to cause parsing inconsistencies or bypass validation that checks for specific type strings? (Medium)",

Can deeply nested vector types cause stack overflow or exponential memory consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: OptionType] [Multiple value attack] The OptionType uses Vec<T> to represent Option - can an attacker provide vec.len() > 1 (multiple values for a single 'optional') causing undefined behavior when consumers expect 0 or 1 elements?
