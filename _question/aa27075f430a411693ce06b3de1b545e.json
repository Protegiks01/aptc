  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [String processing] [Path traversal] Can module names, function names, or type names contain path separators ('/', '\\\\', '::') that cause generated code files to be written to unintended directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [Memory safety] [Box allocation] Does the Box::new() allocation at lines 43 and 45 for nested Vector formats properly handle OOM conditions, or could memory exhaustion cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [Type safety] [Enum variant exhaustiveness] Are all match statements on TypeTag and EntryABI exhaustive, or could new enum variants added in dependencies cause compile-time errors or runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [Type safety] [Reference lifetime] Do the TypeTag references collected in get_required_helper_types() have appropriate lifetimes, or could they become dangling references if the source ABI data is freed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [Code generation] [Identifier collision] Can the generated variant names, field names, and type names collide with reserved keywords or built-in types in target languages (Rust, Python, Go, TypeScript), causing compilation failures or unexpected shadowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [Code generation] [Type representation mismatch] Do all target language generators properly handle the Format types returned by quote_type_as_format(), or could there be languages that misinterpret format specifications causing type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [SDK security] [Transaction construction vulnerabilities] Could vulnerabilities in ABI enum container generation cause SDKs to construct malformed transactions that bypass validation, potentially leading to unauthorized operations on-chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/common.rs] [SDK security] [Type deserialization] When generated SDKs deserialize transaction arguments using the ABI metadata, can type confusion vulnerabilities allow attackers to provide arguments of wrong types that bypass Move VM type checks? (Critical)"
