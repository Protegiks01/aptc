  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Bytecode Version] Passing None for bytecode_version - can this allow scripts compiled for incompatible VM versions to execute? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Signer Authority] The patched function returns a signer for any address - can this bypass Move's signer-based access control in ways that aren't caught? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [Privilege Check] Does force_end_epoch verify that only authorized addresses can trigger epoch transitions, or does the injected signer bypass these checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [System Operations] Can simulated scripts execute system-level operations that should be restricted to validators or governance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [Hash Verification] Does hash.to_vec() properly serialize hashes in a way that prevents collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Transaction Signing] Can the deterministic key generation from seed [0; 32] cause signature reuse across different simulation runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Remote URL Validation] Does the function validate that remote_url points to a trusted node, or can MITM attacks provide malicious state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Client Builder] Can client_builder configuration be manipulated to bypass TLS verification or other security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Ledger Version] Does fetching state at state.version ensure consistency, or can the remote node advance during simulation causing race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: find_function_def_by_name()] [Mutable Reference] Returning &mut FunctionDefinition while iterating - can this cause use-after-free if the vector is reallocated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_module()] [Module Lifetime] Does the deserialized CompiledModule have proper lifetime guarantees, or can dangling references occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Balance Calculation] The balance calculation 100 * 1_0000_0000 - can this overflow in edge cases with different token decimals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Script Index] Using script_idx as u64 - can this overflow if there are more than u64::MAX scripts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Array Indexing] Does script_idx == proposal_scripts.len() - 1 check properly handle empty proposals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Async Safety] Is simulate_multistep_proposal properly async-safe, or can await points cause race conditions with shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_all_proposals()] [Sequential Execution] Does simulate_all_proposals execute proposals sequentially or concurrently, and are there race conditions in either case? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_module()] [Serialization Format] Does state_view.add_module() use the same serialization format as get_module(), preventing deserialization attacks? (High)"
