  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/publish_util.rs] [Function: PackageHandler::new()] [Input validation] Can an attacker provide a malicious PreBuiltPackages implementation that returns corrupted package data, causing PackageHandler initialization to succeed with invalid state that later triggers exploitable conditions during package selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/publish_util.rs] [Function: PackageHandler::new()] [State initialization] Does the initialization properly validate that the Package returned by Package::by_name() contains valid CompiledModules, or can malformed bytecode slip through unchecked leading to VM crashes during execution?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/publish_util.rs] [Function: PackageTracker::find_info()] [Logic error] Does the linear search through publishers create O(n) performance degradation that could be exploited for DoS by repeatedly querying with non-existent publishers?
