(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [HashMap to Vec conversion] At lines 316-322, HashMaps are converted to Vecs via into_values() which loses insertion order - can this cause non-deterministic ordering affecting database inserts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/coin_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Sorting stability] At lines 325-332, data is sorted before insertion - is the sort stable, and can equal elements be ordered non-deterministically across runs? (Low)",
