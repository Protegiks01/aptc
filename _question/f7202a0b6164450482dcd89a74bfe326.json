  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] Are all submodules (docker_common, faucet, indexer_api, node, postgres, processors) declared as public modules intentionally, or could restricting visibility with pub(crate) or private modules reduce attack surface by limiting external access to sensitive workspace server services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Module Organization] Does the public exposure of the faucet module create security risks where external code could directly interact with faucet service logic, potentially enabling unauthorized token distribution or rate limit bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Module Organization] Does the public exposure of the node module allow external manipulation of local node service configurations or state, potentially compromising the development workspace environment? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Module Organization] Does the public exposure of the postgres module create risks where external code could directly access database service primitives, bypassing intended abstraction layers and potentially causing data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Module Organization] Are the module declarations ordered securely, or could the initialization order of these services (docker_common, faucet, indexer_api, node, postgres, processors) create race conditions or dependency issues during workspace server startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/mod.rs] [Missing Validation] Is there a security concern that this module file lacks any re-exports or trait bounds that could enforce security invariants on the exposed services before they are accessible to external code? (Low)"
