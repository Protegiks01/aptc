  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_written()] [Iterator Invalidation] Are there any concurrent modifications to the writes HashSet while keys_written() iterator is active, potentially causing iterator invalidation or missing keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_read()] [Memory Efficiency] Do keys_read() and keys_written() create expensive copies of keys, or can repeated calls during conflict detection cause memory pressure on validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_written()] [Type Extraction] Does the pattern matching in filter_map properly handle all Group(key, _) and Resource(key) variants, or can new variants added in the future be silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_except_delayed_fields()] [Pattern Match Exhaustiveness] Does the match expression handle all InputOutputKey variants, or can future additions of new variants cause this function to silently drop keys, leading to incomplete conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_except_delayed_fields()] [Reference Lifetime] Are the returned &T::Key references guaranteed to outlive the iterator, or can they become dangling pointers if the underlying HashSet is modified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_except_delayed_fields()] [Consistency] Does filtering out DelayedFields here match the semantic expectations of all callers, or can some callers expect to receive all keys including delayed fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Implementation: Debug for ReadWriteSummary] [Information Disclosure] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive transaction information in logs that could be exploited by attackers monitoring validator logs to predict transaction ordering or identify valuable targets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Implementation: Debug for ReadWriteSummary] [Unbounded Output] Can transactions with massive read/write sets cause Debug formatting to produce gigabytes of log output, filling validator disk space or crashing log aggregation systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Implementation: Debug for ReadWriteSummary] [Format String Injection] Are the read/write keys properly escaped in debug output, or can maliciously crafted key values inject format string exploits into logging systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: serialize_from_delayed_field_u128()] [Integer Truncation] When converting DelayedFieldID.extract_unique_index() to u128, can values larger than u128::MAX cause truncation or overflow, leading to ID collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_to_delayed_field_id()] [ID Reconstruction] When reconstructing DelayedFieldID from (u32, 8), does the fixed width of 8 match all production use cases, or can mismatches cause delayed field resolution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: serialize_delayed_field_tuple()] [BCS Vulnerabilities] Does the BCS serialization of (u128, u32) tuples properly handle all edge cases (max values, zero values), or can malformed serialization cause deserialization panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: deserialize_to_delayed_field_u128()] [Error Handling] Are BCS deserialization errors properly propagated, or can Result unwrapping in production code turn these errors into panics that crash validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: serialize_from_delayed_field_id()] [Version Overflow] Can the version field (u32) overflow after billions of delayed field updates, and what happens when version wraps around - does it cause state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: mock_layout()] [Type Safety] Does mock_layout() with empty MoveStructLayout match the actual runtime layout of delayed fields, or can mismatches cause type confusion in the Move VM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Type: HashSet<InputOutputKey>] [Hash DoS] Can attackers craft InputOutputKey values that all hash to the same bucket, degrading HashSet performance to O(n) and causing validator CPU exhaustion during conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Type: HashSet<InputOutputKey>] [Non-Deterministic Iteration] Since Rust's HashSet has non-deterministic iteration order, can this cause different validators to process conflicts in different orders, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Type: HashSet<InputOutputKey>] [Collision Exploitation] Can the SipHash-based hashing used by HashSet be exploited with chosen-prefix collisions to make conflicting keys appear as non-conflicting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Type: HashSet<InputOutputKey>] [Capacity Overflow] Can the HashSet capacity overflow if reads/writes sets approach usize::MAX entries, causing memory allocation failures that panic validators? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Atomic Visibility] When one thread updates a ReadWriteSummary, is the change atomically visible to other threads checking for conflicts, or can memory ordering issues cause stale conflict detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check to time-of-use race between calling conflicts_with_previous() and actually scheduling the transaction for parallel execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Lock Ordering] If multiple ReadWriteSummary instances are locked during conflict detection, is there a consistent lock ordering to prevent deadlocks that halt block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Deterministic Conflict Detection] Can floating-point operations, timestamp checks, or any other non-deterministic logic in conflict detection cause different validators to produce different conflict sets and divergent state roots?
