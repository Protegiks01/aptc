  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_item.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] When aggregate_and_verify() fails, does the code provide sufficient logging to detect Byzantine attacks, or do failures go unnoticed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_item.rs] [Error handling] [Inconsistent error returns] Can the mix of panics, expects, and Result returns create inconsistent error handling that allows Byzantine behavior to go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/buffer_item.rs] [Edge case] [Empty block vector] If Vec<Arc<PipelinedBlock>> is empty, can this cause panics in multiple functions (block_id, round, etc.) disrupting consensus? (High)",
