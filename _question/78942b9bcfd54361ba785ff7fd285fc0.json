  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key generation timing] Can the timing of save_key_pair_bytes() calls leak information about epoch transitions to network observers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Storage visibility] [Thread-local caching] Can different threads maintain inconsistent cached views of storage due to missing memory barriers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_all_certified_aug_data()] [Information leak] Does returning all certified data expose information about other validators' contributions that should be kept private? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Debug/logging] [Sensitive data exposure] Can debug implementations or error messages inadvertently log sensitive key_pair bytes or randomness data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Memory zeroing] [Key disposal] Are key_pair bytes zeroed in memory when replaced or dropped, or do they persist in memory after use? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Clone semantics] [Deep vs shallow] Do all .clone() operations perform deep copies, or can shallow clones create unintended sharing of mutable state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [RwLock fairness] [Writer priority] Does RwLock implementation prioritize writers or readers, and can this be exploited to delay critical operations? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Storage capacity] [No limits] Without storage size limits, can validators with limited RAM become unreliable and compromise consensus liveness? (High)"
