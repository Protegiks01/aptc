  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionGasEvent::to_erased()] [Cost Validation] Does to_erased validate that the cost field in Bytecode events is non-negative and within expected bounds, or can corrupted ExecutionGasEvent instances propagate invalid costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionGasEvent::to_erased()] [Loc Event Handling] For Loc events that set cost to 0, can an attacker spam these events to create massive gas profiling trees that consume memory without actually paying gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: CallFrame::to_erased()] [Recursive DoS] Can deeply nested Call events within CallFrame.events create recursive to_erased calls that overflow the stack, especially for transaction batches with many nested function calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: CallFrame::to_erased()] [Collection Explosion] Does the map operation on self.events properly handle cases where events vector contains thousands of entries, potentially allocating excessive memory for children vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: CallFrame::to_erased()] [String Formatting] Can malicious function names or module IDs in FrameName::Function cause the Render formatting to produce extremely long strings, exhausting memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: CallFrame::to_erased()] [Type Safety] Does the conversion correctly maintain the invariant that Call frames always have cost 0 at the top level, or can manipulated CallFrame data cause non-zero costs to appear at frame level? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::to_erased()] [Total Mismatch] Can the total field in TypeErasedExecutionAndIoCosts diverge from the actual sum of tree node costs, allowing validators to disagree on final gas amounts and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::to_erased()] [Gas Scaling Factor] Does the gas_scaling_factor field get properly propagated without modification, or can it be manipulated during conversion to alter final gas calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::to_erased()] [Node Order] Does the order of nodes pushed (intrinsic, keyless, dependencies, call_graph, ledger_writes) matter for cost calculation, and can reordering cause different total gas values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::to_erased()] [Empty Dependencies] When dependencies vector is empty, does skipping the dependencies node creation cause any inconsistencies in tree structure or cost accounting? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::ledger_writes()] [Write Op Accumulation] Can malicious transactions create thousands of write_set_transient entries that cause excessive memory allocation when converting to Node trees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::ledger_writes()] [Events Explosion] Does the events_transient vector have size limits, or can attackers emit millions of events to exhaust memory during Node tree construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::ledger_writes()] [Cost Validation] Are the costs in transaction_transient, events_transient, and write_set_transient validated to be non-negative before creating Nodes, preventing negative gas charges?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/erased.rs] [Function: StorageFees::to_erased()] [Zero Refund] Does the transaction storage node correctly use Fee::zero() for refund, or can non-zero refunds on transaction storage fees create economic exploits? (High)",
