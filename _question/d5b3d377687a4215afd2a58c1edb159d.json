  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: list_files_with_extension()] [Async Race] The async directory iteration - can concurrent filesystem modifications during traversal cause the tool to read inconsistent state or miss files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: list_files_with_extension()] [Special Files] Does the is_file() check properly exclude special files like /dev/random, FIFOs, or sockets that could block or behave unexpectedly when read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Memory Exhaustion] The fs::read() calls on line 47 load entire files into memory - can an attacker provide gigantic .mv files that exhaust all available RAM before processing begins? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Concurrent Read Limit] The join_all() on line 49 executes all file reads concurrently - can an attacker provide thousands of file paths to exhaust file descriptors or OS resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Error Message Disclosure] The error on line 52 uses generic 'failed to read file' - does the actual filesystem error contain sensitive path information that gets logged elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Async Cancellation] If the async runtime shuts down during join_all(), are file handles properly closed, or could this leak file descriptors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [OOM Handling] When memory is exhausted during file reads, does Rust's allocator handle the failure gracefully, or will the process crash with SIGKILL on Linux systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Partial Read Risk] Does fs::read() guarantee reading the entire file atomically, or could concurrent modifications result in partial/inconsistent reads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: read_modules()] [Vector Capacity] The modules vector collects all file contents - can an attacker cause excessive reallocations and memory fragmentation by providing many files of varying sizes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [CSV Injection] The module_id formatting on line 91 - if ModuleId contains special characters like commas, quotes, or formula prefixes (=, +, @), could this enable CSV injection attacks when opened in Excel? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [Format String] The writeln! macro on line 91 - are the ModuleId Display trait and size values properly sanitized against format string exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [Memory Exhaustion] The String buffer accumulates all output in memory - can an attacker provide millions of modules to exhaust memory during CSV generation before the file is written? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [Newline Injection] Does the ModuleId Display implementation properly escape newlines, or could crafted module names inject additional CSV rows? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [Header Injection] The hardcoded CSV header on line 88 - does it properly escape special characters in column names to prevent header injection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: render_data_csv()] [Quote Escaping] The quoted column name 'expansion size' on line 88 - if module_id contains quotes, are they properly doubled for CSV escaping? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Injection] The args.path on line 101 comes directly from user input without validation - can an attacker provide malicious paths like /etc/passwd or C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Output Overwrite] The fs::write('modules.csv') on line 112 overwrites the file without confirmation - can an attacker race against this to create a symlink pointing to a critical system file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Propagation] The ? operator propagates errors but doesn't clean up resources - could partial CSV files or locks be left behind on error paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Hardcoded Output Path] The output path 'modules.csv' is hardcoded - can an attacker predict this location and perform TOCTOU attacks between file creation and writing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Silent Failures] The println! statements on lines 102 and 105-109 show counts but don't warn if many modules failed to deserialize - could this hide systematic failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Runtime Exit] Does the tokio runtime properly wait for all pending async operations before exiting, or could file writes be truncated if the program exits too quickly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Missing Validation] The path field on line 17 accepts any string without validation - can an attacker provide empty strings, paths with null bytes, or paths exceeding OS limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/tools/compute-module-expansion-size/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Path Expansion] Does clap's value_parser perform any path expansion (~, $HOME, etc.) that could lead to unintended directory access? (Low)",
