  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: max_txns vs max_txns_after_filtering] [Inconsistent Limits] Can max_txns.count() be less than max_txns_after_filtering, creating a logical impossibility where filtered transaction count exceeds the total transaction limit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: max_txns vs max_inline_txns] [Inconsistent Limits] Can max_inline_txns exceed max_txns in either count or bytes, allowing more inline transactions than total transactions and breaking payload structure assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: soft_max_txns_after_filtering vs max_txns_after_filtering] [Inverted Limits] If soft_max_txns_after_filtering > max_txns_after_filtering, does the system ignore soft limits entirely, potentially causing unexpected behavior in partial block filling logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: recent_max_fill_fraction vs pending_ordering] [Logic Interaction] Can specific combinations of recent_max_fill_fraction and pending_ordering values create edge cases where the system alternates between returning empty and full payloads unpredictably? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: pending_uncommitted_blocks vs pending_ordering] [Threshold Bypass] Can setting pending_uncommitted_blocks to zero with pending_ordering=true bypass the wait-for-full-blocks mechanism entirely, allowing premature block proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: ProposalGenerator] [Parameter Mutation] When PayloadPullParameters is passed to pull_payload(), can any of its fields be mutated during async execution, causing different validators to use different parameters for the same round? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: QuorumStoreClient] [Clone Cost] Since params.maybe_optqs_payload_pull_params.clone() is called inside a polling loop, can repeated cloning cause performance degradation that allows Byzantine validators to trigger timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: QuorumStoreClient] [Return Logic] Can the combination of return_non_full and return_empty conditions derived from PayloadPullParameters fields cause validators to return different payload types (empty vs non-full) for the same consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: max_poll_time usage] [Timing Bypass] When start_time.elapsed() >= params.max_poll_time is checked, can system clock adjustments or time synchronization issues cause different validators to have different done flags, leading to non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: PayloadPullParameters] [Missing Constructor] Since PayloadPullParameters has no public constructor (only new_for_test), how is it safely instantiated in production code, and can field-by-field initialization bypass necessary validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Missing Constructor] Since OptQSPayloadPullParams has no constructor, can it be created with exclude_authors containing duplicate authors or invalid author values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_poll_time] [Missing Validation] Is there validation that max_poll_time is less than consensus timeout values, or can excessively long polling times cause validator timeouts and consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns_after_filtering] [Missing Validation] Is max_txns_after_filtering validated against network capacity limits, or can it be set to values that exceed what the network can propagate, causing transaction loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: minimum_batch_age_usecs] [Missing Validation] Is minimum_batch_age_usecs validated to be less than block production time, or can it be set so high that no batches ever meet the age requirement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns] [Zero Value] If max_txns is set to PayloadTxnsSize::zero(), does the system handle empty payloads correctly or can this trigger division-by-zero errors or null pointer dereferences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns_after_filtering] [Zero Value] Can max_txns_after_filtering=0 combined with non-zero soft_max_txns_after_filtering create edge cases where filtering logic accepts transactions it shouldn't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: exclude_authors] [Empty HashSet] If exclude_authors is empty, is this equivalent to excluding no one, or does empty set handling have special cases that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: exclude_authors] [Full Validator Set] If exclude_authors contains all active validators, does the system detect this impossible state and reject it, or does it attempt to pull payloads with no eligible authors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Zero Timestamp] If block_timestamp is Duration::ZERO (epoch time), can timestamp arithmetic underflow when subtracting minimum_batch_age_usecs, causing incorrect batch selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: recent_max_fill_fraction] [NaN/Infinity] Can recent_max_fill_fraction be set to NaN or Infinity through floating point operations, causing all comparisons to fail and breaking the wait-for-full-blocks logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: pending_uncommitted_blocks] [Zero Value] If pending_uncommitted_blocks=0, can this bypass checks that should prevent block proposals when there are pending blocks, allowing conflicting blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Type: Duration] [Overflow in Conversion] When block_timestamp.as_micros() is converted to u64, can values exceeding u64::MAX cause overflow or truncation, leading to incorrect timestamp comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Type: f32] [Precision Loss] Since recent_max_fill_fraction is f32, can precision loss in floating point arithmetic cause different validators to make different decisions about returning empty payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Type: usize] [Architecture Dependence] Since pending_uncommitted_blocks is usize, can behavior differ between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures if this value exceeds 32-bit limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Type: HashSet<Author>] [Hash Collision] Can hash collisions in exclude_authors HashSet cause two different authors to be treated as the same, incorrectly excluding honest validators? (Low)"
