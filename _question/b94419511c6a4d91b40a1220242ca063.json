  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Function: deserialize_with_mode()] [Malformed tag] In FirstProofItem deserialization (different file), a tag byte distinguishes variants. Could TupleCodomainShape deserialization be exploited similarly if A or B contain enum-like structures with malformed tags? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Function: deserialize_with_mode()] [Compression inconsistency] If A is serialized with Compress::Yes but deserialized expecting Compress::No, will ark_serialize catch this, or could it lead to interpreting compressed points as uncompressed, causing curve point validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Function: deserialize_with_mode()] [EOF before completion] If the reader reaches EOF after deserializing A but before B in line 99, does deserialize_with_mode return a clear error, or could partial deserialization leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Function: deserialize_with_mode()] [Recursive deserialization] If A or B are themselves TupleCodomainShape instances, creating nested tuples, could deeply nested deserialization cause stack overflow before validation checks in check() are reached? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Comment: Line 151-152] [Implicit assumption] The comment states 'we implicitly assume that the two msm_eval methods are identical, but is probably not necessary through enums.' Could this assumption be violated in practice, and if so, what are the security implications of using H1::msm_eval for both H1 and H2 terms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Comment: Lines 18-29] [Mathematical correctness] The comment describes the category-theoretic construction. Is this implemented correctly in code? Could errors in translating from mathematical specification to Rust cause subtle violations of homomorphism properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Comment: Lines 61-64] [Rust trait limitations] The comment explains that TupleCodomainShape exists because tuples don't inherit IntoIterator. Could this wrapper introduce bugs that direct tuple use wouldn't have, or vice versa? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/sigma_protocol/homomorphism/tuple.rs] [Integration: LiftHomomorphism] If TupleHomomorphism is wrapped in LiftHomomorphism (from mod.rs), could the projection function interact incorrectly with the tuple structure, causing the lifted homomorphism to apply to the wrong components? (Medium)"
