  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Cross-Shard Read Consistency] When reading state from remote shards, is there transaction isolation to prevent dirty reads or phantom reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [State Read Timeout] If a remote shard doesn't respond to state read requests, does execution timeout and fail, or retry indefinitely causing liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty Address Vector] If remote_shard_addresses is empty, does initialization fail properly or create a shard that can't communicate with anyone? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Duplicate Initialization] If new() is called multiple times for the same shard_id, can this create multiple instances competing for the same network port? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Unbalanced Shard Distribution] If transaction partitioning is skewed such that one shard gets all transactions, does this shard become a bottleneck breaking parallel execution benefits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing Shard Detection] If the coordinator expects N shards but only N-1 are online, does initialization detect and fail, or proceed with partial shard set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Metrics Name Collision] If multiple shards use the same shard_id value, can metric name collisions cause metrics to overwrite each other? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Process Priority] Are shard processes given appropriate OS scheduling priority, or can other processes starve execution causing validator timeout penalties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Shutdown Notification] When a shard shuts down, does it notify the coordinator and other shards, or can silent shutdown cause coordination failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [In-Flight Transaction Handling] Does shutdown wait for all in-flight transactions to complete, or can it abort them mid-execution causing partial state changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ProcessExecutorService] [Clone/Copy Semantics] The struct doesn't implement Clone - if someone tries to clone it, compilation fails, but could shared ownership patterns (Arc) lead to unexpected shutdown behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ProcessExecutorService] [Send/Sync Bounds] Is ProcessExecutorService safely Send/Sync, or can it be sent across thread boundaries causing data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Coordinator Connection Retry] If initial connection to coordinator_address fails, does new() retry or fail immediately, potentially missing transient network issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Address Resolution] If coordinator_address is a hostname rather than IP, can DNS spoofing redirect the shard to a malicious coordinator? (Medium)"
