(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Helper: aggregator_info()] [Max Value Manipulation] When aggregator_info() extracts the limit at line 46 of helpers_v1.rs, can an attacker provide a manipulated limit value that passes initial validation but differs from the actual max_value in the Aggregator struct? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Helper: aggregator_info()] [Reference Lifetime Exploit] Can the StructRef passed to aggregator_info() have an invalid lifetime, and does borrow_field() properly validate the reference is still valid, or can use-after-free occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/aggregator_natives/aggregator.rs] [Helper: unpack_aggregator_struct()] [Field Count Mismatch] The assert at line 55 of helpers_v1.rs checks fields.len() == 3, but can an attacker bypass this by providing a corrupted Struct with duplicate fields or hidden fields that pass the check but cause incorrect unpacking?
