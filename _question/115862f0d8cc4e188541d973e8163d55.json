  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build bypass attack] Can an attacker set the SKIP_FRAMEWORK_BUILD environment variable during CI/CD or production builds to bypass framework compilation and use stale/malicious cached artifacts, potentially deploying compromised Move bytecode to the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply chain poisoning] If SKIP_FRAMEWORK_BUILD is set, does the build script validate that existing cached artifacts (head.mrb) have correct cryptographic signatures or checksums, or can an attacker replace them with malicious framework code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment injection] Can an attacker inject malicious environment variables (beyond SKIP_FRAMEWORK_BUILD) that are passed through to the ReleaseTarget::Head.create_release() call, potentially altering compilation flags or introducing backdoors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build determinism] Does the SKIP_FRAMEWORK_BUILD bypass allow different validators to compile with different framework versions, breaking deterministic execution and causing state divergence across the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path traversal] In the current_dir().expect() call, if an attacker controls the working directory through symlinks or mount points, can they cause the build script to read framework sources from an attacker-controlled location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Directory manipulation] When calling prev_dir.pop() to get the parent directory, are there any edge cases (root directory, empty path) that could cause the script to monitor incorrect directories or fail unsafely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Symlink attack] Can an attacker create symbolic links in the framework directory structure to redirect the build script to compile malicious Move code from outside the repository? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path injection] Are the hardcoded path strings (like 'aptos-experimental/sources') vulnerable to path injection if the filesystem supports special characters or Unicode normalization attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Mount point attack] If an attacker mounts a malicious filesystem at one of the watched directories during build time, can they inject malicious Move source files that get compiled into the framework? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [OUT_DIR hijacking] Can an attacker manipulate the OUT_DIR environment variable to redirect the head.mrb output to a world-writable location where they can replace it with malicious bytecode before it's loaded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Output tampering] After head.mrb is written to OUT_DIR, is there any integrity check or signature verification before it's used at runtime, or can an attacker modify it post-build? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Race condition on output] Between creating head.mrb and it being loaded by the application, can an attacker win a race condition to replace the file with malicious content? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Insecure file permissions] Does the head.mrb file get created with overly permissive file permissions (e.g., 0666) that allow other users to modify the framework bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between when OUT_DIR is validated and when head.mrb is written, allowing directory substitution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Create_release failure] If ReleaseTarget::Head.create_release() returns an error, does the build script fail loudly, or could it silently continue with stale artifacts causing validators to run different code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Compilation flags injection] Can an attacker influence the compilation flags passed to create_release() (like with_srcs=true) to include source code in the binary that reveals sensitive logic or attack vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode version mismatch] Does create_release() validate that the Move compiler version matches the expected blockchain protocol version, or can mismatched bytecode cause runtime failures or exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency confusion] Can an attacker perform a dependency confusion attack where create_release() pulls malicious Move packages from an untrusted repository instead of the official Aptos framework? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build optimization bypass] Does create_release() apply security-critical optimizations (like bounds checking), or can an attacker force debug mode compilation that includes exploitable code paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build cache poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate the cargo:rerun-if-changed directives to prevent recompilation when malicious changes are made to framework sources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Incomplete monitoring] Are there framework source files not covered by the rerun-if-changed directives that could be modified without triggering a rebuild, allowing stealthy backdoors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Move.toml manipulation] The script monitors Move.toml files but doesn't validate their integrity - can an attacker modify dependency versions or addresses in Move.toml to pull malicious code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate file timestamps in the watched directories to fool cargo into thinking sources haven't changed, using stale bytecode with known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Recursive directory monitoring] The rerun-if-changed directives monitor entire 'sources' directories - can an attacker add deeply nested files that aren't properly tracked causing inconsistent builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] The .expect() calls on current_dir() and OUT_DIR will panic on failure - can an attacker trigger these panics in production builds to cause deployment failures or use fallback mechanisms?
