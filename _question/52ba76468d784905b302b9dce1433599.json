  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Sequence Number Increment] If sequence_number is provided and operations are retried, can the sequence number increment incorrectly causing transaction ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: get_account_address()] [PublicKey Conversion] At line 640, try_into() converts between public key types. Can this fail for certain key formats, causing incorrect account derivation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: metadata_for_ops()] [AccountAddress Conversion] At line 761, account_address() is called. Are all address formats properly supported, or can certain formats cause parsing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Hex Decoding] At line 832, hex::decode could fail or produce incorrect bytes. Is input validation sufficient to prevent malformed hex strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Atomic Submission] At lines 686-706, multiple operations are performed (build, sign, submit). If any step fails, is state properly rolled back, or can partial transactions leak information or funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Partial Signing] At lines 837-852, if signing fails for one payload but succeeds for others, is the transaction properly aborted or can it be submitted with partial signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unsigned_transaction()] [Transaction State] At lines 796-815, if parsing fails after transaction construction, is the unsigned transaction properly discarded, or can it be reused causing signature replay? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Pool Ownership] At lines 470-513, who is authorized to create stake pools? Can anyone create pools on behalf of others, potentially locking funds or creating malicious pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: distribute_staking_rewards()] [Reward Distribution Auth] At lines 431-468, is there validation that the sender has permission to distribute rewards for the specified operator and staker? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_operator()] [Operator Change Auth] At lines 234-273, what prevents unauthorized parties from changing the operator? Is private key possession the only authorization, or are there additional checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_voter()] [Voter Change Auth] At lines 275-313, can the operator unilaterally change the voter without staker approval, potentially hijacking voting power? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_operations()] [Sequence Number Reuse] If a transaction fails but the sequence number was consumed, does retry logic properly increment the sequence number, or can transactions be lost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Transaction Replay] At lines 831-834, the RawTransaction is deserialized and signed. Is there any check preventing the same transaction from being re-signed and submitted multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: submit_transaction()] [Submission Idempotency] At lines 898-910, can the same signed_transaction be submitted multiple times, and if so, does the blockchain properly reject duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [Request Serialization] At line 140, serde_json::to_string could produce excessively large JSON. Is there size validation to prevent DoS through giant requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: make_call()] [Response Deserialization] At line 148, json() deserialization could fail on malformed data. Is error handling sufficient to prevent panics from malicious server responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: sign_transaction()] [Signature Bytes] At line 850, hex_bytes from signature encoding should be validated before inclusion. Can malformed signatures bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: new()] [Client Pooling] At line 42, a new ReqwestClient is created without connection pooling configuration. Can this lead to connection exhaustion under high load? (Low)",
