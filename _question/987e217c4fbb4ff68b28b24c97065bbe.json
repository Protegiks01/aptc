  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Dependency missing] Does the function verify that all dependencies required by the new version (e.g., updated framework modules, new Move features) are available before generating the version upgrade proposal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Circular dependency] Can version upgrade proposals create circular dependencies with other proposals in the same release, causing deadlocks or execution failures in multi-step governance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Null handling] If version is a reference to a null or uninitialized AptosVersion struct, does the function detect this and return an error, or can it generate proposals with undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Empty result] Under what conditions does the function return an empty Vec, and can this empty result be misinterpreted by callers as successful proposal generation, leading to missing version upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Boolean flags] What happens if both is_testnet and is_multi_step are true - does this create an invalid configuration that should be rejected, or can it generate confusing proposals with mixed execution modes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Option handling] If next_execution_hash is Some but is_multi_step is false, does the function ignore the hash or generate an invalid proposal that includes the hash without multi-step infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Script tampering] After the proposal script is generated, can an attacker modify the returned String content before it's submitted to governance, since there's no integrity protection (e.g., signature) on the script itself? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash mismatch] Does the function calculate and verify the execution hash of the generated script to ensure it matches the expected value for multi-step proposals, or can hash mismatches go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Determinism] Is the script generation deterministic (same inputs always produce same output), or can non-determinism in CodeWriter or formatting cause different proposal hashes across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Module availability] Does the function verify that the aptos_framework::version module exists and is accessible at the target network, or can it generate proposals that fail due to missing modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Function signature] Can changes to the version::set_for_next_epoch function signature in future framework versions break the generated proposals, since the function hardcodes the signature at line 30? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Reconfiguration safety] Does the function verify that aptos_governance::reconfigure is safe to call after version::set_for_next_epoch, or can the reconfiguration trigger unexpected state transitions with the staged version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Proposal metadata] Does the function generate or require proposal metadata (title, description, discussion URL) for governance submission, or can proposals be submitted without proper documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Voting requirements] Does the function ensure the generated proposal meets minimum voting requirements (quorum, voting period, approval threshold) or can it create proposals that are unexecutable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Gas estimation] Does the function estimate or validate the gas cost of the generated proposal, or can unexpectedly expensive proposals exceed gas limits and fail during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Rollback capability] If a version upgrade causes issues, does the function provide any mechanism to generate rollback proposals, or are version upgrades irreversible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Emergency stop] Can the function generate emergency proposals to pause or revert a version upgrade mid-execution, or are there no safety mechanisms once reconfigure is called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Test coverage] Does the function have comprehensive test coverage for all parameter combinations (is_testnet true/false, is_multi_step true/false, next_execution_hash Some/None), or are edge cases untested? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Validation mode] Does the function support a dry-run or validation mode that generates proposals without submitting them, allowing security review before production use? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Backwards compatibility] When generating proposals for newer versions, does the function ensure the Move code is backwards compatible with the current version's VM and framework? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Network partition] Can inconsistent version upgrade proposals across different nodes cause network partitions where some validators accept the new version and others reject it? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [State migration] Does the function coordinate with state migration logic when versions change, or can version upgrades leave state in an incompatible format? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Consensus safety] Can a version upgrade proposal be executed while consensus is in progress, potentially causing validators to switch protocol versions mid-round and breaking safety guarantees? (Critical)"
