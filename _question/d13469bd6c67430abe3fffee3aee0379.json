(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Unwind safety] Is the code unwind-safe - if a panic occurs during value.clone(), can this leave the mutex or condvar in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value() & get_value()] [Memory ordering] Does the Mutex provide sufficient memory ordering guarantees that changes to RemoteValueStatus in set_value() are visible to all threads in get_value()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Cache coherency] In multi-core validator nodes, can cache coherency issues cause different cores to observe different RemoteValueStatus states leading to non-deterministic execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value() & set_value()] [No error returns] Neither function returns Result - can error conditions (like mutex poisoning) be properly handled and recovered from in production environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: waiting()] [Resource allocation failure] Can Arc::new() or Mutex::new() fail due to resource exhaustion, and if so, how does the panic propagate through the sharded executor? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Comment lines 8-10] [Semantic contract] The comment states this provides 'semantics for blocking' - but are the actual blocking semantics (no timeout, no cancellation) appropriate for a consensus-critical blockchain system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Comment lines 50-52] [State transition invariants] Are there documented invariants about valid state transitions (e.g., Waiting -> Ready only, no Ready -> Waiting), and can violating these cause consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Thundering herd] When notify_all() wakes multiple waiting threads simultaneously, can this cause thundering herd problems with all threads competing for the mutex, degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [Writer starvation] If get_value() is called continuously by many readers, can the set_value() writer be starved and unable to acquire the lock, causing liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Struct: RemoteStateValue] [Thread safety] While RemoteStateValue is Send + Sync due to Arc/Mutex, are there any usage patterns in the sharded executor that violate thread safety assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [Byzantine delay attack] Can a Byzantine shard deliberately delay calling set_value() just before validator consensus timeout, causing some validators to timeout while others succeed, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: get_value()] [State dependency attack] Can Byzantine shards create circular state dependencies where Shard A waits for Shard B which waits for Shard A, causing deadlock across the entire sharded executor? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Enum: RemoteValueStatus] [State transition validation] Should there be explicit validation that state only transitions from Waiting -> Ready and never Ready -> Waiting to prevent state machine bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/remote_state_value.rs] [Function: set_value()] [Idempotency] Is set_value() idempotent - if called twice with the same StateValue, should it be a no-op or can repeated calls cause issues? (Low)",
