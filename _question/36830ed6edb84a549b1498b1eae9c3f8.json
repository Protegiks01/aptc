(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/execution_config.rs] [Function: generate_execution_config_upgrade_proposal()] [Version downgrade] Can an attacker submit a V7 config with persisted_auxiliary_info_version set to 0, disabling auxiliary info persistence and breaking features that depend on this data? (High)",
