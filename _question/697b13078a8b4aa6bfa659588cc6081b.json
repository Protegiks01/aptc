  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Struct: ExecutionConfig] [Equality Check Bypass] Does the PartialEq implementation properly compare all security-critical fields including genesis transaction contents, or can equivalent configs be incorrectly deemed different? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: fmt() for Debug] [Information Leak] Does the Debug implementation's truncation of genesis to 'Some(...)' prevent sensitive genesis transaction details from leaking in logs, or can full genesis be reconstructed from debug output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: fmt() for Debug] [Log Injection] Can genesis_file_location PathBuf contain newlines or control characters that cause log injection attacks when Debug formatted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: processed_transactions_detailed_counters] [Performance Side Channel] When processed_transactions_detailed_counters is enabled, can detailed metrics expose transaction processing patterns that aid attackers in timing attacks or MEV extraction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: processed_transactions_detailed_counters] [Metrics Overhead] Can enabling processed_transactions_detailed_counters cause sufficient performance overhead that validators with this enabled consistently lag behind, affecting their consensus participation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Multiple Fields] [Conflicting Settings] Can paranoid_type_verification=true but async_runtime_checks=true create race conditions where type violations are detected asynchronously after commit, breaking transaction atomicity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Multiple Fields] [Cache + BlockSTM Interaction] Can layout_caches_enabled=true combined with blockstm_v2_enabled=true create cache coherency issues during parallel execution leading to non-deterministic behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Multiple Fields] [Verification + Discard Interaction] If paranoid verifications are disabled and discard_failed_blocks is enabled, can this combination allow invalid blocks to be accepted instead of properly discarded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Multiple Fields] [Concurrency + Verification] Can high concurrency_level combined with paranoid verifications create resource exhaustion where verification overhead under high parallelism causes OOM or deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Error Context Loss] Do the map_err() calls preserve sufficient error context for debugging, or can important details about I/O failures be lost causing difficult-to-diagnose validator issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Partial Read Handling] Does read_to_end() handle partial reads correctly, or can interrupted reads leave the buffer in an inconsistent state that BCS deserialization accepts but produces invalid genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Write Failure Recovery] If write_all() fails partway through writing genesis.blob, does the error handling ensure the file is deleted/marked invalid rather than left in a corrupt state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [File Descriptor Leak] If File::create() succeeds but subsequent operations fail, does the file handle get properly closed via Drop or can repeated failures cause file descriptor exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [RootPath Manipulation] Can the root_dir parameter to load_from_path() be manipulated to point to attacker-controlled directories, bypassing intended configuration isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Path Concatenation Attack] Does root_dir.full_path(&self.genesis_file_location) properly sanitize path concatenation to prevent directory traversal through crafted genesis_file_location values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Canonical Path Check] Does the code verify that genesis_path.exists() checks the canonical path (resolving symlinks), or can symlink manipulation bypass existence checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Constant: GENESIS_BLOB_FILENAME] [Filename Collision] Can the hardcoded 'genesis.blob' filename collide with other system files or be predictably targeted by attackers for replacement attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Constant: GENESIS_VERSION] [Version Validation] Is the constant GENESIS_VERSION=0 validated against actual genesis transaction versions, or can mismatched versions pass through optimization logic? (Medium)",
