  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: symbol()] [UTF-8 exploit] Does symbol() properly handle invalid UTF-8 in the symbol Vec<u8>, or can attackers inject malicious byte sequences that cause parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: supply_aggregator_state_key()] [Unwrap panic] Does supply_aggregator_state_key() safely handle None values with unwrap() calls, or can attackers cause validator panics by creating CoinInfo with None supply? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: random()] [Weak randomness] Does random() use cryptographically secure randomness for handle and key generation, or can attackers predict aggregator addresses and precompute collisions? (High)",
