  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Critical] [Consensus-breaking behavior] Can native functions access non-deterministic data (system time, random numbers, I/O) and return it in NativeResult, causing validators to compute different state roots and fork the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Critical] [Gas bombing] Can an attacker craft transactions that call native functions with minimal upfront cost but cause exponential resource consumption in the VM, effectively DoSing validators? (Critical)",
