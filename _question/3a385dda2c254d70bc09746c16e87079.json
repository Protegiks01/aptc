  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Attack] [Chosen Ciphertext Attack] Can an attacker submit specially crafted ciphertexts designed to trigger specific error patterns, using the error responses as a decryption oracle? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Attack] [Grinding Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly submit ciphertexts with slight variations to bypass error checks through computational grinding until a forgery succeeds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Attack] [Fault Injection] If an attacker can inject faults (e.g., through hardware attacks) to trigger specific errors, can they bypass cryptographic protections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Attack] [Error Correlation] Can attackers correlate error patterns across multiple validators to infer information about the threshold structure, validator identities, or key shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Validation] [Input Sanitization] Before operations that could trigger these errors, is input properly sanitized and validated, or can malformed input bypass initial checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Boundary] [Zero Values] How do these errors handle zero-value inputs (e.g., zero shares, zero-length data)? Can zero values bypass validation and cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Boundary] [Maximum Values] Are there maximum size limits enforced before operations that prevent resource exhaustion before errors are triggered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Boundary] [Negative Values] For any numeric parameters, are negative values properly validated to prevent integer underflow or wrap-around issues before error checks? (Low)"
