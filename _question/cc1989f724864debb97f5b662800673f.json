  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/gen_replay_verify_jobs.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [State snapshot expectations] Can missing state snapshots (expect on line 71) cause panics instead of graceful errors, making the job generation brittle and exploitable for DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/gen_replay_verify_jobs.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Start version filter] Does the take_while condition for start_version (line 91) properly handle edge cases where start_version equals a range boundary? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/gen_replay_verify_jobs.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Snapshot filtering] Can filtering logic for epoch ranges be bypassed to include snapshots from epochs that should be excluded from verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/utils.rs] [Function: parse_maxable_u64()] [Input validation] Can malformed input strings cause parse() to panic instead of returning Err, leading to DoS when parsing version parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/utils.rs] [Function: parse_maxable_u64()] [Case sensitivity exploit] Is the lowercase conversion properly applied, or can mixed-case variations of 'max' bypass the special handling and cause parse errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/utils.rs] [Function: parse_maxable_u64()] [Whitespace handling] Does the function properly trim whitespace, or can leading/trailing spaces cause valid inputs to be rejected or 'max' to be misinterpreted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Module integration] [State consistency] Can switching between different DBTool commands (Backup → Restore → ReplayVerify) in quick succession cause state inconsistencies due to concurrent database access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Module integration] [Error propagation] Are errors from different modules (backup, restore, bootstrap) properly distinguished, or can error message confusion cause operators to misdiagnose critical failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Module integration] [Resource cleanup] Do all async commands properly clean up resources (file handles, network connections, database locks) on error, or can resource leaks accumulate causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Module integration] [Command precedence] If multiple commands are somehow triggered simultaneously, is there proper locking to prevent conflicting operations on the same database? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Storage backend] [Credential leakage] Can DBToolStorageOpt configuration inadvertently log or expose cloud storage credentials in error messages or debug output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup_maintenance.rs] [Storage backend] [Access control] Does the storage backend properly enforce read-only vs. read-write access controls, preventing unauthorized modification of backups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Storage backend] [Man-in-the-middle] Can backup data be intercepted and modified during transit from storage to the restore process, allowing injection of malicious state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Storage backend] [Encryption at rest] Does the backup process ensure data is encrypted before writing to storage, or can backup data be read by unauthorized parties with storage access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Storage backend] [Versioning bypass] Can an attacker restore from old backup versions that contain known vulnerabilities or exploits that have since been patched? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Async execution] [Await ordering] Can improper await ordering in the run() function cause commands to execute in unexpected order, violating assumptions about database state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Async execution] [Tokio runtime panic] Can panics in async backup operations poison the tokio runtime, causing subsequent commands to fail or hang indefinitely? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [DB integrity] [Partial writes] If restore is interrupted during database writes, can it leave the database in a state where some column families are updated but others are not, causing inconsistencies? (High)",
