  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Integer Overflow] Can the total_voting_power field (u128) overflow if validators with maximum u64 voting power values are added, potentially causing incorrect quorum calculations and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Integer Overflow] Can the total_joining_power field (u128) overflow when accumulating pending_active validators' voting power, leading to incorrect validator set transitions during epoch changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [State Inconsistency] Are total_voting_power and total_joining_power fields properly validated to match the sum of individual validator voting powers, or can deserialization create inconsistent state that breaks consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Consensus Bypass] Can an attacker craft a ValidatorSet with total_voting_power set to 0, causing division-by-zero or bypassing quorum checks in ValidatorVerifier creation? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Enum: ConsensusScheme] [Algorithm Downgrade] Can an attacker modify the scheme field from BLS12381 to an invalid/future value during deserialization, causing consensus to accept signatures verified with wrong cryptographic algorithms? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Enum: ConsensusScheme] [Backward Compatibility] If new consensus schemes are added in the future, can nodes with different ConsensusScheme values fork the network by disagreeing on signature verification methods? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Function: new()] [Uninitialized State] Does new() leave total_voting_power and total_joining_power as 0 regardless of the payload, creating inconsistency with actual validator voting powers that could break quorum calculations? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Function: payload()] [Missing Validators] Why does payload() only chain active_validators and pending_inactive, excluding pending_active validators who should be part of the validator set for signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Function: payload()] [Epoch Transition Bug] During epoch transitions, does excluding pending_active from payload() cause ValidatorVerifier to miss validators who will become active, leading to rejected signatures from legitimate new validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Function: payload()] [Inconsistent State] Can the exclusion of pending_active from payload() cause inconsistencies when ValidatorVerifier is constructed, where new validators cannot participate in consensus immediately after epoch change?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/validator_set.rs] [Function: payload()] [Iterator Safety] Does payload() guarantee consistent ordering of validators across multiple calls, or can the iterator return validators in different orders causing ValidatorVerifier index mismatches? (High)",
