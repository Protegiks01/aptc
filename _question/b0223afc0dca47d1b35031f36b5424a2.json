  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Legacy Mode Confusion] Can implementations mix legacy gas tracking and direct gas meter access incorrectly when has_direct_gas_meter_access_in_native_context() transitions between versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Legacy Gas Accumulation] Can implementations fail to properly accumulate legacy_gas_used, causing incorrect gas charges when direct metering is disabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [safely_pop_arg Misuse] Can implementations use the safely_pop_arg! macro incorrectly (wrong type parameter, wrong order), causing type confusion or missing arguments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [safely_assert_eq Side Effects] Can implementations use safely_assert_eq! with expressions that have side effects, causing inconsistent behavior depending on whether assertions pass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [SmallVec Overflow] Can implementations push too many values into the SmallVec<[Value; 1]> return, causing heap allocation and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Value Construction Errors] Can implementations construct invalid Values (wrong inner type, corrupted data) that pass initial checks but cause issues in subsequent VM execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Incremental Gas Charging Config] Can the enable_incremental_gas_charging flag be misconfigured, causing natives to skip incremental charging when it should be enforced? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Gas Hook Abuse] Can malicious gas_hook implementations in SafeNativeBuilder observe and manipulate gas expressions to extract information or cause side effects? (Medium)",
