  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidLedgerInfo] [Missing epoch state] The error states 'No next_epoch_state specified in the provided Ledger Info' - can an attacker exploit this by providing ledger info without next_epoch_state to bypass epoch transition validation?

  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidProposal] [Malformed proposal] Can a Byzantine validator craft proposals that pass initial validation but trigger InvalidProposal during safety rules checking, allowing malformed blocks to be partially processed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidProposal] [String parameter injection] Does InvalidProposal's String parameter get properly sanitized before logging, or can attackers inject malicious log content? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidProposal] [Validation bypass] Are all proposal validation rules consistently enforced, or can certain invalid proposals slip through and only get caught with InvalidProposal as a fallback? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidQuorumCertificate] [Signature aggregation attack] Can an attacker forge quorum certificates with invalid BLS signature aggregations that pass initial checks but trigger InvalidQuorumCertificate later, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidQuorumCertificate] [Voting power manipulation] Can InvalidQuorumCertificate validation be bypassed by manipulating validator voting power calculations to make invalid QCs appear valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidQuorumCertificate] [Threshold bypass] Does InvalidQuorumCertificate properly verify that QC signatures meet the required 2f+1 threshold, or can attackers craft QCs with insufficient signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidQuorumCertificate] [Historical QC replay] Can old quorum certificates from previous epochs or rounds be replayed to trigger InvalidQuorumCertificate, causing validators to reject legitimate blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: NotInitialized] [Uninitialized state exploitation] Can an attacker exploit the NotInitialized error condition to use safety rules in an uninitialized state, bypassing critical safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: NotInitialized] [Race condition] Can concurrent initialization and usage of safety rules create race conditions where NotInitialized checks pass but the system is not fully initialized? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: NotInitialized] [Partial initialization] Can attackers trigger NotInitialized by corrupting persistent storage during initialization, leaving validators in a partially initialized state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: NotInitialized] [String parameter exposure] Does NotInitialized expose which specific field is not set, potentially revealing internal state information to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: NotSafeForOrderVote] [Order vote bypass] Can a Byzantine validator craft order vote requests with manipulated block round or highest timeout round values to bypass NotSafeForOrderVote safety checks? (Critical)",
