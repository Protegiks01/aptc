  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Double Withdrawal] When processing multiple pools, can successful withdrawal from one pool be repeated on another pool before state updates, allowing double-spending of the same unlocked stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Operator Address Exploit] In StakingContract withdrawals, can an attacker specify an incorrect operator_address to distribute funds to the wrong operator's commission account instead of the owner? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker submit withdrawal transactions for pools with no unlocked balance to waste gas and grief legitimate users by making their withdrawal operations more expensive? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Partial Withdrawal State] If some withdrawals succeed and others fail in the multi-pool loop, does this leave the stake in a partially withdrawn state that can be exploited to bypass future withdrawal limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: WithdrawStake::execute()] [Reentrancy] Although Move prevents classic reentrancy, can the withdrawal to CoinStore trigger any callbacks or events that could be exploited to manipulate state before the withdrawal completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Governance Manipulation] Can an attacker increase lockup on someone else's stake to artificially boost voting power or prevent legitimate votes by front-running governance proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Pool Type Confusion] Does the function use different on-chain functions for each pool type (stake_increase_lockup, staking_contract_reset_lockup, vesting_reset_lockup) - can these be confused to trigger incorrect lockup changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Vesting Contract Address Validation] When calling vesting_reset_lockup with stake_pool.vesting_contract.unwrap(), can a malicious API return None causing a panic, or return an incorrect address to reset lockup on the wrong vesting contract? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Lockup Period Manipulation] Does the function validate that the new lockup period is reasonable, or can an attacker increase lockup to u64::MAX to permanently lock funds and prevent future governance participation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call increase_lockup on pools they don't own by manipulating owner_address or exploiting missing authorization checks in the CLI tool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Operator Address Exploit] For StakingContract pools, can an attacker provide a fake operator_address to reset lockup on unintended contracts or bypass operator-specific lockup policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [State Inconsistency] When processing multiple pools, if lockup increases succeed on some pools but fail on others, does this create an exploitable state where voting power is miscalculated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit system time or block timestamp vulnerabilities to increase lockup to a future date that is calculated incorrectly, either locking funds too long or too short? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Vesting Schedule Bypass] For Vesting contracts, can increasing lockup interfere with the vesting schedule to accelerate or delay token release improperly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: IncreaseLockup::execute()] [Gas Manipulation] Can an attacker trigger increase_lockup with minimal gas to cause partial execution that leaves pools in inconsistent lockup states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Operator Hijacking] If operator_address is None and defaults to owner_address, can an attacker exploit race conditions to initialize a stake pool with themselves as operator before the legitimate owner? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Voter Manipulation] Similarly, if voter_address is None and defaults to owner_address, can this default be exploited to assign voting rights to unintended addresses through API manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Initial Stake Amount Overflow] Can an attacker specify u64::MAX for initial_stake_amount to trigger overflow in on-chain initialization logic and corrupt the stake pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Re-initialization Attack] Does the function check if the owner is already initialized, or can it be called multiple times to reset stake pool parameters and potentially steal delegated stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Address Validation] Are operator_address and voter_address validated as legitimate account addresses, or can invalid/malicious addresses be set to brick the stake pool or redirect operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Zero Stake Initialization] Can an attacker initialize with initial_stake_amount=0 to create dysfunctional stake pools that consume resources but provide no value or security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Owner Address Derivation] Does sender_address() properly derive the owner address from the transaction signer, or can this be spoofed to initialize pools for other accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Delegation At Birth] Can setting operator_address and voter_address to attacker-controlled addresses during initialization bypass normal delegation authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [Balance Drain] Does initialization verify the owner has sufficient balance for initial_stake_amount, or can it overdraw the account leading to failed transactions or unexpected state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeStakeOwner::execute()] [System Address Protection] Can an attacker initialize stake pools for system addresses (0x1, 0x2, etc.) to interfere with protocol-level staking mechanisms? (High)"
