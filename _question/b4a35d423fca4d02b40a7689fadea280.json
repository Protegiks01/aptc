  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_signature_verify_strict()] [Argument order] Is the argument popping order (msg, pubkey, signature) at lines 104-106 consistent with the Move function signature, or can reordering cause verification of wrong combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_public_key_validate()] [CPU exhaustion] Can an attacker submit keys requiring maximum decompression iterations to exhaust validator CPU even with correct gas charging, causing validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_signature_verify_strict()] [Memory exhaustion] Can extremely large message inputs cause memory allocation failures or OOM conditions during hashing, even if gas is properly charged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_signature_verify_strict()] [Verification grinding] Can attackers craft signatures that maximally exploit the verification algorithm's computational complexity, causing validator performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [All functions] [Gas price manipulation] If gas prices are set too low relative to actual computational cost, can attackers spam signature verifications to degrade network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [All functions] [Non-deterministic execution] Can floating point operations, uninitialized memory, or platform differences cause these functions to produce different results on different validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [All functions] [Fork-choice impact] Can exploits in signature verification affect validator voting or block signing, causing consensus failures or chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Integration] [Validator key confusion] Could these primitives be exploited to confuse validator signing keys with user transaction keys, enabling validator impersonation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Integration] [Quorum manipulation] Can signature verification bugs be exploited to forge validator signatures, allowing attackers to create fake quorum certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_public_key_validate()] [Feature flag race] Can the feature flag check at line 55 race with feature flag updates, causing inconsistent behavior where some validators see the old flag value and others see the new value? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/ed25519.rs] [Function: native_public_key_validate()] [Flag manipulation] Can malicious governance proposals manipulate the ED25519_PUBKEY_VALIDATE_RETURN_FALSE_WRONG_LENGTH flag to enable/disable validation at strategic times to break security? (High)"
