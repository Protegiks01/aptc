(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Argument Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious command-line arguments with excessive length (e.g., 1GB+ strings) that cause memory exhaustion when env::args().collect() allocates vectors, leading to validator node crashes or denial of service?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal Handling] Does the program register proper signal handlers before std::process::exit(1) at line 19, or can SIGINT/SIGTERM during prover execution leave corrupted verification artifacts that could be exploited in subsequent runs?
