  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Function: ManagingRefs::new()] [Address format bypass] Does new() validate the format and validity of AccountAddress, or can attackers pass malformed addresses that appear valid but break downstream signer generation or code upgrade logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Function: ManagingRefs::new()] [Ownership verification] Does the new() constructor verify that the caller has ownership of the address before creating ManagingRefs, or is this check performed elsewhere, creating potential for privilege escalation if checks are incomplete? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Function: ManagingRefs::new()] [Immutability enforcement] Can new() be called for addresses where code has been frozen as immutable, potentially recreating upgrade capabilities for supposedly permanent code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Signer generation exploit] When ManagingRefs is used to generate a signer for code upgrades, can the extend_ref be manipulated to generate signers for arbitrary addresses, bypassing the object ownership model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Object address collision] Can an attacker exploit the object_seed generation to predict or collide with future object addresses, creating ManagingRefs in advance to hijack code deployment for subsequently created objects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Sequence number manipulation] Since object addresses are derived from publisher address and sequence number, can manipulating transaction ordering or sequence numbers allow attackers to control the resulting addresses in ManagingRefs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Cross-module attack] Can malicious Move modules bypass the intended access controls by directly importing and manipulating the ExtendRef or ManagingRefs structures instead of using the object_code_deployment module's entry functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Resource group bypass] Since ManagingRefs is stored in ObjectGroup, can attackers exploit resource group mechanics to read, modify, or delete ManagingRefs without proper authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Event emission bypass] Can attackers perform code deployments or upgrades while manipulating ManagingRefs structures to prevent proper event emission, hiding malicious code changes from indexers and monitors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Gas metering bypass] Can operations involving ManagingRefs serialization/deserialization be exploited to bypass gas metering, enabling expensive operations at low cost or creating DoS vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Package registry corruption] Can corrupted or malicious ManagingRefs structures cause the PackageRegistry to enter an inconsistent state where code deployments succeed but modules cannot be executed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Upgrade policy bypass] Can ManagingRefs be used to bypass upgrade policy restrictions (immutable, compatible-only), allowing incompatible or malicious upgrades that violate the declared policy? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Dependency poisoning] Can an attacker who controls ManagingRefs for a dependency object upgrade that dependency with malicious code, affecting all packages that depend on it? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ExtendRef] [Type safety] Can the Rust type system be bypassed using unsafe code or transmute operations to reinterpret ExtendRef as another type, potentially corrupting the address field or extracting sensitive data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ManagingRefs] [Lifetime issues] Are there any lifetime or borrow checker violations in code that uses ManagingRefs that could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities or dangling references to extend_ref? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ManagingRefs] [Clone/Copy semantics] Can ManagingRefs be cloned or copied (explicitly or through auto-traits), and if so, does this create multiple copies of extend_ref that could be used for unauthorized concurrent upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ExtendRef] [PartialEq implementation] Can the derived PartialEq implementation be exploited in comparison operations to bypass security checks, such as comparing ExtendRefs with forged addresses that appear equal? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Struct: ManagingRefs] [Debug trait exposure] Does the derived Debug trait leak sensitive information about extend_ref addresses through debug logs or error messages that could be exploited by attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [All structs] [Panic safety] Can deserialization of malformed ExtendRef or ManagingRefs cause panics that crash validator nodes, creating a denial of service or consensus failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [All structs] [Unsafe deserialization] Does the serde deserialization use any unsafe operations internally that could be exploited through carefully crafted serialized data to achieve arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [State rollback attack] If a transaction that creates ManagingRefs is aborted after the struct is created but before code is deployed, can the orphaned ManagingRefs be exploited to deploy code without proper initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Partial state commit] Can partial failures during code deployment leave ManagingRefs in storage while the corresponding code object is not properly initialized, creating inconsistent state exploitable for privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Concurrent creation] Can two concurrent transactions create ManagingRefs for the same object address, and if so, which one takes precedence, and can this race condition be exploited for unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Deterministic address generation] Is the address stored in ManagingRefs deterministically derived from the object creation parameters, or can non-determinism across validators lead to different ManagingRefs addresses and state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/object_code_deployment.rs] [Integration] [Object deletion attack] If the underlying object is deleted but ManagingRefs persists, can attackers recreate the object at the same address and gain upgrade privileges through the orphaned ManagingRefs?
