  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Module Organization] Does the conditional compilation with #[cfg(feature = 'fuzzing')] create security gaps where critical identifier validation tests are only run during fuzzing but not in production test suites, potentially missing bugs in release builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Test Coverage] Is the lack of non-fuzzing unit tests in this module a security concern, where deterministic edge cases for Move module identifiers (max length, special characters, encoding issues) are not explicitly tested outside property-based testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Referenced Test: identifier_serializer_roundtrip] Can malicious actors exploit inconsistencies in BCS serialization/deserialization of module_id where the roundtrip test doesn't catch non-canonical serializations that could bypass security checks in production code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Referenced Test: identifier_serializer_roundtrip] Does the proptest strategy CompiledModule::valid_strategy(20) adequately cover adversarial module identifier patterns (unicode normalization attacks, homograph attacks, buffer boundary cases) that could cause security vulnerabilities in module resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Referenced Test: identifier_serializer_roundtrip] Can an attacker craft a module identifier that serializes successfully with bcs::to_bytes but causes unwrap() to panic on deserialization in production code, leading to validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/unit_tests/mod.rs] [Referenced Test: identifier_serializer_roundtrip] Does the test verify that module_id comparisons are consistent across serialization boundaries, or could an attacker create colliding module identifiers through encoding manipulation that bypass duplicate module checks? (Critical)"
