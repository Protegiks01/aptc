(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: download_and_update_if_remote()] [Download Path Traversal] The git_info.download_to path is used without validation - can an attacker provide paths with ../ that cause git to clone repositories into arbitrary directories like /etc or /bin? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: download_and_update_if_remote()] [Cache Poisoning] When checking if download_to.exists(), can an attacker pre-populate the cache directory with malicious code before the build, bypassing the fresh git clone? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: download_and_update_if_remote()] [Skip Fetch Attack] When skip_fetch_latest_git_deps is true and cached version exists, updates are skipped - can an attacker exploit this to use vulnerable cached dependencies in production by manipulating cache state?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: download_and_update_if_remote()] [Rev Parsing Bypass] The code checks if git_rev is a commit using find_rev() - can an attacker craft a rev string that appears to be a commit hash to this check but resolves to a different commit during actual checkout? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: download_and_update_if_remote()] [Tag Immutability Assumption] The code assumes tags don't change and skips updates - can an attacker exploit force-push to tags to update malicious code without triggering re-fetch?
