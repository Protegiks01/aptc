  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Panic in async context] Could panic in any called async function (.await points) leave the checker or provider in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [IndexResponse field validation] Are all fields in IndexResponse properly validated before comparison, or could malformed responses (null, negative values) cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Network partition detection] Can this checker detect when baseline and target nodes are on different sides of a network partition with the same chain_id? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Eclipse attack vulnerability] Could an attacker performing an eclipse attack isolate the target node while still passing identity checks by controlling both baseline and target responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Sybil attack enablement] Does passing identity check make it easier for an attacker to launch Sybil attacks by appearing as multiple legitimate nodes on the same chain? (High)",
