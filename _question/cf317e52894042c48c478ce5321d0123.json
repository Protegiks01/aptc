  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation_event.rs] [Struct: KeyRotationEvent] [Drop implementation] Is there a custom Drop implementation that securely zeros out authentication key memory, or do keys remain in memory after KeyRotationEvent is dropped, enabling memory scraping attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation_event.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Event ordering] When KeyRotationEvent is emitted in account.move, can race conditions cause events to be emitted in the wrong order, making old_authentication_key not match the actual previous key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation_event.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Atomicity violation] If key rotation fails after emitting KeyRotationEvent but before updating the account resource, can this create inconsistent state where events claim rotation occurred but the key wasn't changed?
