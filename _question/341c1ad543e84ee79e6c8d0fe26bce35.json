  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Use Case Empty State] If a use case becomes empty in delayed_queue, is it correctly moved to placeholder state, or can stale entries cause incorrect delay calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Account Empty State] When an account's transaction queue empties in delayed_queue, can this trigger race conditions where new transactions from that account are incorrectly delayed or not delayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [DelayKey Ordering] DelayKey uses (try_delay_till, input_idx) for ordering - can manipulating input_idx values cause transactions to violate intended delay ordering? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [BTreeMap Consistency] If delayed_queue's BTreeMap entries become corrupted (e.g., duplicate keys), can this cause select_next_txn_inner() to skip or duplicate transactions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Borrow Checker Bypass] If unsafe code elsewhere bypasses the borrow checker to hold multiple mutable references to the iterator, can this corrupt input_queue or delayed_queue state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Struct: ShuffledTransactionIterator] [Interior Mutability] If any fields use Cell/RefCell for interior mutability, can this cause race conditions in single-threaded contexts with re-entrant calls? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Move Semantics] When extended_with() moves self, are all fields properly moved, or can partially-moved state cause issues if the function panics mid-execution? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn()] [Drop Implementation] If Txn type has a custom Drop implementation with side effects, can dropping transactions during queue operations cause unintended state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Struct: ShuffledTransactionIterator] [Memory Layout] Are there any unsafe transmute operations that could misinterpret the memory layout of ShuffledTransactionIterator causing undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay transactions across different blocks, and will the shuffling logic detect this or process them as new transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Time-Based Attacks] Can attackers exploit knowledge of when their transactions will become ready in delayed_queue to perform time-sensitive attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: extended_with()] [Transaction Withholding] Can a malicious validator withhold certain transactions from extended_with() to manipulate block contents while maintaining plausible deniability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/iterator.rs] [Function: select_next_txn_inner()] [Sybil Attack] Can an attacker create many sender addresses to bypass sender_spread_factor limits, flooding blocks with their transactions? (Medium)"
