  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Generics] [Unsized types] Can Spanned<T> be used with unsized types (like dyn Trait or slices)? If so, could this cause issues with Copy trait or memory layout assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Dependency] [FileHash security] The file_hash field uses FileHash from move_command_line_common - are there known vulnerabilities in FileHash implementation? Could hash collisions allow different source files to be treated as the same file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Dependency] [Empty hash] The unsafe_no_loc function uses FileHash::empty() - is this a special sentinel value? Could code that checks for valid file hashes be bypassed by using the empty hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Dependency] [Hash verification] Is FileHash cryptographically secure? Could an attacker create malicious source files with the same FileHash as legitimate files, allowing code substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Arithmetic] [Checked operations] None of the arithmetic operations (other.end + 1, other.start - 1) use checked_add or checked_sub - should they? Could forcing the compiler to use release mode make these operations silently overflow, corrupting location data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Arithmetic] [Wrapping semantics] In Rust, integer overflow in release mode causes wrapping - are all callers of overlaps_or_abuts and subtract prepared to handle wrapped values? Could wrapping create security vulnerabilities in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Arithmetic] [Saturation alternative] Should the arithmetic operations use saturating_add/saturating_sub instead to prevent overflow? Would saturation create its own security issues by clamping to maximum/minimum values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Validation] [Debug-only checks] Why is the start <= end invariant only checked with debug_assert instead of a runtime check or returning Result? Is this a performance optimization that creates security vulnerabilities in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Validation] [Post-condition checks] Should functions like try_merge and subtract include post-condition assertions to verify they don't create invalid Locs? Could the lack of such checks allow bugs to propagate silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Validation] [Defensive programming] Should all public functions validate their Loc parameters before use, or is the expectation that all Locs are always valid? If the latter, how is this guaranteed given serialization and potential bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Impact] [Bytecode verification bypass] If location tracking is corrupted, could malicious Move bytecode pass verification by claiming to originate from trusted source locations, bypassing security checks based on code origin? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Impact] [Source attribution attack] Could an attacker exploit location corruption to make malicious code in Move contracts appear to come from trusted standard library locations, causing developers to trust malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Impact] [Audit trail corruption] Does Aptos use Loc data for audit trails or compliance? Could corrupted locations break audit requirements for regulated applications built on Aptos? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Impact] [Formal verification impact] If Move's formal verification tools rely on accurate location information, could location corruption cause verification to miss vulnerabilities or incorrectly certify malicious code as safe? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Function: file_hash()] [Immutable return] The file_hash() getter returns FileHash by value - is FileHash Copy or Clone? Could this cause performance issues or unexpected behavior if FileHash is expensive to copy? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Function: start()/end()] [Unchecked access] The start() and end() getters return raw ByteIndex values without validation - should they check that the internal state is valid (start <= end) before returning? Could callers get inconsistent values if accessed during concurrent mutation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Macro: sp!] [Namespace collision] Could the sp! macro's pattern matching collide with user-defined patterns in Move compiler code, causing unexpected behavior or allowing malicious code injection during macro expansion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/location.rs] [Macro: sp!] [Partial pattern risk] The macro allows matching just loc or just value using _ - could this lead to accidentally dropping security-critical information when pattern matching on Spanned values in the compiler? (Low)"
