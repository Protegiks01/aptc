  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Module visibility] Does the public re-export of `FromOnChainGasSchedule` trait allow untrusted external code to implement custom gas schedule parsing, potentially bypassing validation in the `from_on_chain_gas_schedule()` method? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [API exposure] By publicly exporting `ToOnChainGasSchedule` trait, can malicious actors create gas schedules with manipulated parameter names or values that could be serialized and proposed through governance without proper validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Version management] Does the public export of `LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION` constant allow external code to query and potentially exploit version-specific gas calculation differences across feature versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Genesis initialization] The public `InitialGasSchedule` trait could be implemented by external code - can this be exploited to inject malicious initial gas parameters during testnet or private network genesis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Module structure] Does the flat re-export structure (`pub use gas_schedule::*`) potentially expose internal implementation details or unstable APIs that should remain private? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Documentation security] The comment documentation suggests gas parameters can be 'removed or renamed' - does the version pattern matching in trait implementations properly handle missing parameters to prevent panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Trait safety] Are the three exported traits (`FromOnChainGasSchedule`, `ToOnChainGasSchedule`, `InitialGasSchedule`) marked as `unsafe` where appropriate, or could safe implementations introduce undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/lib.rs] [Dependency exposure] By re-exporting `gas_feature_versions` module, are internal version constants exposed that could be used to fingerprint network versions or exploit version-specific vulnerabilities? (Low)"
