  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hash collision] Can two different type names (e.g., 'MyHTTPServer' and 'MyHttpServer') produce identical snake_case outputs, causing cryptographic hash domain collisions that enable signature forgery or state corruption across different transaction types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hash collision] Does the function handle consecutive uppercase letters correctly (e.g., 'HTTPSConnection' -> 'https_connection' vs 'h_t_t_p_s_connection'), and could inconsistent handling allow attackers to craft type names that collide with system types like ValidatorConfig or StakePool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hash collision] Can an attacker create custom Move types with names like 'APTCoin' vs 'AptCoin' that produce identical hasher seeds, allowing them to forge signatures or bypass transaction validation by exploiting hash domain confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Hash collision] Are acronyms handled deterministically (e.g., 'BLSSignature' vs 'BlsSignature' vs 'BLSSig')? Could this enable type confusion attacks where malicious contracts mimic system types like Ed25519Signature or MultiEd25519Signature? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Domain separation bypass] If two types 'Coin' and 'COIN' both convert to 'coin', does this break the domain separation invariant for CryptoHasher, potentially allowing cross-type signature replay or Merkle proof forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 9] [Unicode normalization] Does the function handle Unicode uppercase characters correctly (e.g., 'Ñoño', 'Café')? Could non-ASCII uppercase letters bypass the 'c.is_uppercase()' check, causing incorrect snake_case conversion and hasher name collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 12] [Unicode to_lowercase] Does 'c.to_lowercase()' handle multi-byte lowercase expansions safely (e.g., Turkish 'İ' -> 'i̇')? Could this cause buffer issues or produce unexpected hasher names that collide with existing system types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Unicode collision] Can Unicode homoglyphs (e.g., Latin 'A' vs Cyrillic 'А') be used to create type names that appear different but convert to identical snake_case, enabling phishing attacks or type confusion in governance proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Special characters] How does the function handle non-letter characters like digits, underscores, or symbols? If 'MyType123' and 'MyType_123' produce the same output, could this enable hasher collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Zero-width characters] Are zero-width Unicode characters (U+200B, U+FEFF) preserved or stripped? Could attackers inject invisible characters to create type names that collide with system types while appearing distinct? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Empty string] What happens if an empty string is passed? Does this produce an empty hasher name that could collide with a default hasher or cause panic in the CryptoHasher macro? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Single character] How are single-character type names handled (e.g., 'A', 'X')? Could this enable collision with internal identifiers or cause issues in the hasher seed generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 10-11] [First character uppercase] If the first character is uppercase (e.g., 'Transaction'), does it get converted correctly? Could a bug here cause 'Transaction' and 'transaction' to produce different hasher names, breaking determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [All lowercase input] If the input is already all lowercase (e.g., 'mytype'), is it handled correctly? Could this bypass domain separation if it collides with a properly formatted type name? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [All uppercase input] How does 'CONSTANT' convert? Does each letter get an underscore prefix (e.g., '_c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t'), and could this produce excessively long hasher names that cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 7] [Capacity allocation] The function pre-allocates with 'String::with_capacity(text.len())', but if uppercase letters add underscores, could this cause reallocation? Is this a DoS vector for very long type names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Generic types] How are generic type parameters handled (e.g., 'Vec<T>', 'Option<Coin>')? Does the function strip brackets, and could this cause 'VecT' and 'Vec<T>' to collide, breaking signature verification for generic transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Nested types] For qualified type names (e.g., 'aptos_framework::coin::Coin'), are namespace separators (::) handled correctly? Could '::' cause unexpected underscores that enable hasher collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Lifetime parameters] If type names include lifetime annotations (e.g., 'Foo<'a>'), are these stripped before conversion? Could lifetime syntax cause parsing errors or produce non-deterministic hasher names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Macro hygiene] Since this function is called during macro expansion, are there race conditions if multiple threads compile different types concurrently? Could this cause non-deterministic hasher seed generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Signature forgery] If two Move transaction types produce colliding hasher seeds due to conversion bugs, could an attacker sign a transaction of type A and replay it as type B, bypassing access control or stealing funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Merkle proof forgery] Can hasher collisions enable Merkle proof substitution attacks where an attacker proves inclusion of data type A using a proof for type B, corrupting state verification in AptosDB? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [BLS aggregation] If validator signatures use colliding hashers, could this break BLS signature aggregation in consensus, allowing forged quorum certificates or double-signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [State commitment] If resource types (Coin, StakePool) have colliding hashers, could this enable state root manipulation where an attacker modifies one resource type but Merkle proofs verify against another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Transaction validation] Can type name collisions bypass the transaction prologue validation in aptos_account.move, allowing unauthorized system transactions or fee bypass? (Critical)"
