  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic Safety] If any operation in main() panics, is the panic caught or does it propagate causing process abort with potential data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-decompiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Thread Safety] Is main() safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously, or can concurrent invocations cause race conditions in global state? (Low)",
