  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_secure_storage::Error>] [KeyVersionNotFound handling] Does the handling of KeyVersionNotFound and KeyNotSet errors properly distinguish between missing keys vs. corrupted keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_secure_storage::Error>] [Catch-all conversion] The catch-all branch converts all other storage errors to SecureStorageUnexpectedError - can critical errors be masked by this generic conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Function: From<aptos_secure_storage::Error>] [Error pattern matching] Can new error types added to aptos_secure_storage bypass the pattern matching and be incorrectly categorized? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error enum] [Serialization of errors] Since Error implements Serialize/Deserialize, can serialized errors be tampered with during network transmission to hide attack evidence? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error enum] [Error cloning] Does the Clone implementation on Error create any security issues with mutable error state being shared? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error enum] [Error equality] Can the PartialEq/Eq implementations be exploited to make different errors appear equal, bypassing error-specific handling? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error enum] [Discriminant manipulation] Can the error enum discriminant be manipulated to convert one error type to another, bypassing validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error handling] [Error recovery] Are all error conditions properly handled at call sites, or can some errors be silently ignored leading to safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error handling] [Concurrent error handling] Can race conditions in concurrent error handling cause multiple validators to enter inconsistent error states? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error logging] [Information disclosure] Do error messages expose too much internal state information that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error propagation] [Error chain attacks] Can attackers craft attack chains that trigger cascading errors across multiple validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Integer parameters] [Overflow in error parameters] Can integer overflow in u64 error parameters (epochs, rounds, versions) cause incorrect error reporting that masks attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: String parameters] [Unbounded string allocation] Can error String parameters be exploited to cause excessive memory allocation through extremely long error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: thiserror] [Macro expansion vulnerabilities] Can the thiserror::Error macro expansion introduce any security vulnerabilities in error handling code? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [General: Error types] [Missing error variants] Are there critical error conditions in consensus safety rules that are not represented in this Error enum, potentially causing unhandled errors? (High)"
