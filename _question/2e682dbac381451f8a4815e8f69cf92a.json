  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Context Leakage] Does the context() method on deserialization errors expose full file paths that could reveal directory structures to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Unsafe Location] Does the use of Spanned::unsafe_no_loc().loc properly handle the 'unsafe' designation, and could this lead to security issues in location tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Unreachable Code] Is the unreachable!() macro at line 207 truly unreachable, or could a logic error or future code changes allow execution to reach this panic point? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Extension Confusion] Can the extension selection logic be exploited to create output files with unexpected extensions that could be misinterpreted by other tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Filename Collision] If multiple bytecode files have the same base name but are in different input directories, could they collide when written to the same output_dir? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Does file_name().expect() properly handle paths without a filename component, or could this cause panics or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Format String] Can the report formatting with {} and join() be exploited if filenames contain format string specifiers or other special characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Information Disclosure] Does the report output reveal the number and names of all processed files, potentially exposing project structure information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] Since execute() is async but processes files sequentially, could there be race conditions if multiple instances run concurrently on the same output_dir? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: Disassemble::execute()] [Async Safety] Does the mutable self reference in execute(mut self) create any safety issues when combined with async execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Path Component Attack] Can an attacker craft path components that exploit the Component::Normal() check to bypass the 'bytecode_modules' to 'sources' replacement logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Directory Confusion] Could the path transformation logic be confused by paths containing both 'bytecode_modules' and 'sources' directories, leading to incorrect file resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Memory Corruption] Can SourceMapping::new_from_view() with a no_loc location cause undefined behavior or memory safety issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can providing source_code via with_source_code() with extremely large source files cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Version Mismatch] Can mismatched versions between command_type and version parameters cause the match statement to fall through to the error case unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: print_metadata()] [Version Handling] Does the fallback to v1_metadata when get_compilation_metadata() returns None properly handle all bytecode versions, or could newer versions be misreported? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Version Check] Is the comparison script.version < VERSION_7 using the correct comparison operator, or could version == VERSION_7 be missed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: downgrade_to_v6()] [Serialization Error] Does serialize_for_version() handle all possible bytecode structures, or could edge cases cause silent data corruption during version downgrade? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [Stack Overflow] Can deeply nested Move bytecode structures cause stack overflow during BinaryIndexedView creation or Disassembler processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: decompile_v2()] [Memory Leak] Does the Decompiler properly clean up resources, or could repeated decompilations cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: decompile_v1()] [Environment Variables] Can environment variables be manipulated to affect Command::new() behavior or the executed Revela binary path? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: decompile_v1()] [Working Directory] Does the Command execution inherit the working directory, and could this lead to unexpected file access or path resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Input Validation] Does read_dir_files() validate that all returned paths are actually files and not directories, devices, or other special file types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symbolic Link] Can symbolic links in the package_path cause infinite loops or access to files outside the intended directory? (Medium)",
