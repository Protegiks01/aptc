  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [All Functions] [Validator collusion] Can colluding validators (< 1/3 Byzantine) combine their RNG outputs to bias the collective DKG randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_g1_points()] [Cyclic sequence] For large n, does the sequence acc.double() + shift eventually cycle, and could the cycle length be small enough to cause collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_scalar_from_uniform_bytes()] [Modular reduction bias] Is the bias from 512-bit to ~256-bit field negligible (< 2^-128), and have statistical tests confirmed uniform distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_128bit_scalar()] [Field element validity] Does from_bytes_le() validate that the 128-bit value is less than the scalar field order, or could large values cause field overflow? (Medium)",
