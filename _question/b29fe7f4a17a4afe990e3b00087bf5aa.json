  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Cross-function] [Pruning race] If get_account_ordered_transactions_iter() is called while prune_transaction_by_account() is executing, can this cause iterator to return partially pruned results or crash with missing key errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Cross-function] [Version ordering] Do get_account_ordered_transaction_version() and get_account_ordered_transactions_iter() use consistent version ordering, or can version comparisons differ causing transaction visibility inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Cross-function] [Ledger version parameter] All read functions take ledger_version as parameter. Can an attacker provide an old ledger_version to read historical state that should have been pruned, bypassing pruning policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Sequence numbers] [Gap exploitation] If sequence numbers have gaps (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 6), do the query functions properly handle this or can attackers exploit gaps to hide transactions or cause iteration failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Sequence numbers] [Overflow] What happens when an account's sequence number approaches u64::MAX? Can this cause overflow in checked_add operations or iterator boundary calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Sequence numbers] [Reorg handling] If a chain reorganization occurs and sequence numbers get reused with different transactions, do the storage indexes properly update, or can stale indexes cause transaction mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [ReplayProtector] [Type confusion] At line 151, the code checks for ReplayProtector::SequenceNumber. If future ReplayProtector variants are added, can this cause incomplete pruning or pruning of wrong transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Iterators] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent writes to the transaction database cause active iterators to skip entries, return duplicates, or crash with consistency errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Iterators] [Memory exhaustion] Are there limits on the number of concurrent iterators, or can an attacker create thousands of iterators to exhaust validator memory causing node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Iterators] [Seek failures] What happens if iter.seek() or iter.seek_for_prev() operations fail silently? Can this position iterators at wrong locations returning incorrect transaction sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Iterators] [End-of-iteration] When an iterator exhausts all matching transactions, does it properly signal completion, or can it return corrupted data from adjacent key ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Database] [transaction_db_raw() safety] All functions call ledger_db.transaction_db_raw(). Does this provide proper isolation, or can raw database access bypass transaction safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Database] [Schema type safety] Are the generic schema types (OrderedTransactionByAccountSchema, TransactionSummariesByAccountSchema) properly type-checked, or can type confusion cause reads/writes to wrong schemas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Database] [Key collision] Can carefully crafted account addresses or sequence numbers cause key collisions in the (address, sequence_number) or (address, version) tuples used as schema keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Database] [Corruption detection] If the underlying RocksDB database becomes corrupted, do the read operations detect and error gracefully, or can they return corrupted data causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] If database operations return errors, are they always propagated via the Result type, or can some errors be silently ignored causing incomplete operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Error handling] [AptosDbError propagation] The function returns Result with AptosDbError. Can error type conversions lose critical error details causing incorrect error handling upstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Edge cases] [Empty account] What happens when querying an account with no transactions? Do the functions properly return empty results or can they error unexpectedly causing API failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Edge cases] [Zero values] Can passing 0 for sequence_number, version, or limit parameters cause division by zero, underflow, or unexpected behavior in iteration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [State consistency] [Multi-schema atomicity] Operations span multiple schemas (OrderedTransactionByAccountSchema, TransactionSummariesByAccountSchema). Are cross-schema operations atomic, or can failures leave schemas in inconsistent states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [State consistency] [Read-after-write] If a transaction is written but indexes haven't updated, can reads see partially committed state violating transaction atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [State consistency] [Validator divergence] If different validators prune at different times or have different ledger_version values, can this cause state divergence where validators have different views of transaction history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/transaction_store/mod.rs] [Performance] [Unbounded queries] Can an attacker repeatedly query with max values for num_versions or limit causing excessive disk I/O and degrading validator performance affecting consensus participation? (High)",
