  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Linear dependence] Beyond checking g != h, is there validation that g, h, and g_2 are linearly independent in the discrete log sense, preventing related-key attacks in the PVSS protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Group mismatch] Since enc uses G1Projective and g_2 uses G2Projective, are there validation checks ensuring these groups are correctly paired and compatible for pairing-based cryptography? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: get_commitment_base()] [Unvalidated return] Does get_commitment_base() return a reference without validating that g_2 is still a valid group element, potentially exposing corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Empty AIP-80 prefix] The AIP_80_PREFIX is empty string - does this bypass important versioning or identification checks that could prevent mixing incompatible public parameters across protocol upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Recursive to_bytes()] The ValidCryptoMaterial::to_bytes() at line 91 calls self.to_bytes() - is there risk of infinite recursion or stack overflow if trait resolution fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Trait: WithMaxNumShares] [Ignored parameter] The with_max_num_shares(_n: usize) function ignores the n parameter and just calls Default - can this cause incorrect parameter sizing for large DKG ceremonies, leading to out-of-bounds access or truncation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Trait: WithMaxNumShares] [Comment mismatch] The comment 'Setup is fast enough' at line 101 suggests no optimization needed, but does this create performance bottlenecks in large-scale DKG that could be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Trait: Default] [Unexpected BLS base] Default::default() calls default_with_bls_base() instead of new_from_seed(SEED_PVSS_PUBLIC_PARAMS) - can this inconsistency cause validator nodes to use mismatched parameters if some call Default and others use explicit initialization? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep copy security] When PublicParameters is cloned, are all cryptographic group elements properly deep-copied, or can shared references lead to mutation attacks where one instance's parameters affect others? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Derive: PartialEq, Eq] [Constant-time comparison] Do the derived PartialEq and Eq implementations use constant-time comparison for group elements, or can timing side-channels leak information about private parameters during equality checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Derive: PartialEq, Eq] [Malleability] Can an attacker create two different byte representations that deserialize to 'equal' PublicParameters according to PartialEq but behave differently in cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leak] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive cryptographic parameters in logs or error messages that could aid attackers in analyzing the PVSS scheme? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Vec allocation] Does appending to the bytes vector at line 82 properly handle allocation failures or can OOM conditions cause panics that crash validator nodes during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Memory leak] If g_2.to_compressed().to_vec() fails or panics after enc.to_bytes().to_vec() succeeds, is the allocated memory for enc bytes properly cleaned up? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Slice bounds] The slice indexing [0..PUBLIC_PARAMS_NUM_BYTES] and [PUBLIC_PARAMS_NUM_BYTES..NUM_BYTES] - are these bounds always valid or can malformed NUM_BYTES constant cause out-of-bounds access?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Unwrap safety] The g2_opt.unwrap() at line 146 - is it safe to unwrap after checking is_some().unwrap_u8() == 1u8, or can race conditions cause the Option to become None between check and unwrap? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Compression ambiguity] Does G2Projective::to_compressed() produce a canonical representation, or can multiple different compressed byte sequences decompress to the same group element, enabling parameter confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Decompression failure modes] If G2Projective::from_compressed() encounters invalid encodings, does it fail securely with clear errors or can it return corrupted group elements that appear valid but break cryptographic operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Point validation] After decompression, is the resulting G2 point validated to be on the curve and in the correct subgroup, or can invalid curve points be injected that break pairing operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Compressed vs uncompressed] The code uses to_compressed() - if somewhere else in the system uncompressed points are expected, can this size mismatch cause buffer overflows or truncation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Encryption compatibility] Are the encryption_elgamal::g1::PublicParameters in the enc field guaranteed to be compatible with the G2-based commitment scheme, or can mismatched group elements break the PVSS protocol?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: get_encryption_public_params()] [Immutability] Does returning an immutable reference to enc prevent callers from modifying encryption parameters, or can unsafe code or interior mutability patterns bypass this protection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Cross-group relationships] Since g and h are in G1 while g_2 is in G2, are there cryptographic relationships (via pairings) that must be validated to ensure the parameters are secure? (High)",
