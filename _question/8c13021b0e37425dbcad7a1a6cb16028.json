  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Trait bound violations] Can MoveStructType be implemented incorrectly for NewEpochEvent (e.g., wrong module/struct names) without compile-time detection, causing runtime failures during event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event interpretation] Can different validator implementations interpret the epoch u64 field differently (e.g., as milliseconds vs seconds), causing validators to disagree on when epochs begin/end? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization non-determinism] Can different Rust compiler versions or optimization levels cause bcs::from_bytes() to produce different results, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Static: NEW_EPOCH_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Type tag divergence] Can validators with different Rust standard library versions compute different TypeTag values from struct_tag(), causing event filtering inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event storage corruption] If NewEpochEvent is persisted to storage and the storage backend corrupts the epoch u64 field, can this cause validators to fork when replaying history from corrupted storage? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Historical event compatibility] If the NewEpochEvent struct format changes, can old events from storage still be deserialized, or will validators crash when reading historical epoch events during sync? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS library vulnerabilities] Does the code pin a specific version of the bcs crate, or can supply chain attacks introduce malicious BCS deserialization code that compromises epoch event processing? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [move_core_types vulnerabilities] Are there known vulnerabilities in the move_core_types dependency that affect identifier handling, allowing attackers to craft malicious module/struct names? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Empty byte array] Does try_from_bytes() properly reject empty byte arrays, or can zero-length input be deserialized into a default NewEpochEvent with epoch = 0? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: event_key()] [Null key handling] Can new_epoch_event_key() return a null or invalid EventKey under any circumstances, causing event emission/subscription to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Static: NEW_EPOCH_EVENT_V2_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [String literal security] Is the hardcoded string '0x1::reconfiguration::NewEpoch' vulnerable to Unicode normalization attacks or homoglyph substitution that could bypass type checking? (Low)"
