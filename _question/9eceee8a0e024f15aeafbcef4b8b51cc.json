  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization vulnerability] Can an attacker cause a panic or undefined behavior by triggering the unwrap() on line 29 during serialization failure, potentially causing validator nodes to crash during DKG ceremonies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Deserialization attack] Can a malicious validator submit a crafted byte array that deserializes to an invalid group element not on the curve, bypassing cryptographic security assumptions and potentially breaking the PVSS scheme? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Point-at-infinity attack] Does the deserialization in try_from() (lines 37-42) validate that ek is not the point at infinity, or can an attacker inject the identity element to trivialize encryption and expose secret shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Subgroup attack] Does deserialize_compressed() on line 38 verify that the deserialized point belongs to the correct prime-order subgroup, or can an attacker submit points from a small-order subgroup to leak information about secret keys through subgroup confinement attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Compression format attack] Does serialize_compressed() on line 29 produce deterministic output, or can the same EncryptPubKey serialize to different byte representations, allowing signature malleability or consensus divergence during DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Denial of service] Can an attacker send extremely large or malformed byte arrays to try_from() that cause excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption during decompression, degrading validator performance during critical DKG phases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Error handling] Does the generic DeserializationError on line 39 leak information about why deserialization failed, potentially revealing details about expected curve parameters that could aid cryptanalytic attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Empty prefix vulnerability] The AIP_80_PREFIX is set to empty string on line 25 - does this create collision risks where EncryptPubKey serializations could be confused with other crypto material types in the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: generate()] [Weak randomness] Does sample_field_element() on line 58 properly check the quality of the RNG, or can a validator with a compromised PRNG generate predictable decryption keys that allow other parties to derive their secret shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: generate()] [Zero key attack] Can sample_field_element() return the zero scalar on line 58, creating a trivial decryption key where dk=0 and thus ek=infinity, completely breaking confidentiality for that validator's shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: generate()] [Timing side channel] Does the random field element generation on line 58 run in constant time, or can timing variations leak information about the generated private key through network timing analysis during distributed key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Memory safety] Is the private key dk (line 49) properly zeroized when dropped, or does it remain in memory where it could be extracted through memory dumps, cold boot attacks, or side-channel analysis on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Clone vulnerability] The DecryptPrivKey does not derive Clone - but if it were cloned elsewhere, could multiple copies of the secret key exist in memory, increasing the attack surface for key extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: Uniform] [Generic bound vulnerability] The Uniform implementation (lines 52-61) requires both rand::Rng and rand::CryptoRng - but does the actual usage enforce CryptoRng, or could a non-cryptographic RNG be accidentally passed, generating weak keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Public parameter tampering] Can an attacker supply a malicious pp_elgamal parameter with a manipulated pubkey_base() on line 69, causing honest validators to compute incorrect encryption keys that break the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Point multiplication attack] Does the scalar multiplication on line 69 (pubkey_base().mul(self.dk)) validate that the result is not the identity element before returning, or can edge cases create degenerate encryption keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Inconsistent group operations] Does into_affine() on line 69 handle the conversion from projective to affine coordinates correctly for all edge cases, including points at infinity or with zero coordinates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Determinism violation] Is the encryption key computation on lines 67-71 deterministic across all validator nodes, or could differences in arkworks library versions or platform-specific optimizations cause consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Comment mismatch] The comment on line 66 says 'H^{dk}' but the code computes pubkey_base().mul(dk) which is 'H * dk' in additive notation - does this notational confusion lead to incorrect implementations elsewhere in the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: Convert] [Type safety] The Convert trait (lines 63-72) is generic over the auxiliary parameter type - can an attacker pass the wrong PublicParameters type, causing type confusion and incorrect key derivation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [G2 point validation] Does the DealtPubKey.new() constructor on line 83 validate that the G2Affine point G is on the curve and in the correct subgroup, or can invalid points break pairing-based cryptography? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Point at infinity] Can the G field (line 78) be set to the point at infinity in G2, creating a trivial public key that breaks the dealt secret key security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKeyShare] [Redundant wrapper] The DealtPubKeyShare is simply a wrapper around DealtPubKey (line 89) - does this prevent proper type checking, allowing public keys to be confused with their shares in the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Do the constructors new() on lines 83 and 92 perform any validation of their inputs, or can arbitrary invalid group elements be wrapped and propagated through the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Serialization missing] DealtPubKey derives Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq (line 75) but not Serialize/Deserialize - does this prevent network transmission of dealt public keys, or is there an unsafe workaround being used?
