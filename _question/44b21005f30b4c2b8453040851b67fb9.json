  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Fuzzing] Has this function been fuzzed with arbitrary Unicode inputs, extremely long strings, and adversarial type names? Could unfuzzed inputs cause panics or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Naming guidelines] Are there documented guidelines for Move type naming to prevent hasher collisions? Could developers unknowingly create collision-prone names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Error messages] If a collision occurs, are error messages clear enough for developers to understand the security implications? Could obscure errors lead to insecure deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Prefix collision] Can 'MyType' and 'MyTypeExtended' be confused if hasher name comparison uses prefix matching instead of exact matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Numeric suffix collision] Do 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' produce sufficiently distinct hashers, or could numeric suffixes enable collision attacks in token standards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Case-folding attacks] Beyond simple uppercase/lowercase, are case-folding equivalences (e.g., 'ß' -> 'ss', 'ﬁ' -> 'fi') considered? Could ligatures or special Unicode enable collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Combining characters] How are Unicode combining characters (e.g., 'é' as 'e' + combining acute) handled? Could decomposed and composed forms collide? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 9] [char::is_uppercase()] Does this handle all Unicode uppercase categories correctly (Lt, Lu)? Could titlecase letters cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 12, 15] [Iterator extend()] Using extend() on ToLowercase iterator - could this have unexpected behavior for multi-codepoint lowercase expansions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 9] [String::chars()] The chars() iterator handles multi-byte UTF-8 correctly, but are there edge cases with invalid UTF-8 or surrogate pairs passed from macro input? (Low)"
