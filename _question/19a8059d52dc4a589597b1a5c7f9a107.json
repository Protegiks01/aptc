  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Enum discriminant] Is the MultisigTransactionPayload enum discriminant stable across protocol versions, or can upgrades cause deserialization of old transactions to fail? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Hash] [Address hashing] Is multisig_address hashed in big-endian/little-endian consistently to prevent different nodes computing different hashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Float comparison] If future payload types include floating point, will NaN handling break equality invariants and cause consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [None equality] Does None == None for transaction_payload, and can this be exploited to make unapproved transactions appear approved? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Deep vs shallow] Does Clone create deep copies of nested EntryFunction data, or can attacker modify shared references affecting multiple transaction instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Clone cost] Is cloning a Multisig with large payload proportional to payload size, or can attacker submit huge payloads causing DoS during clone operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Reference counting] If EntryFunction uses Arc internally, does cloning increment reference counts correctly to prevent use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Integration] [Validation bypass] Does the VM validate that Multisig transactions have sufficient approvals before calling as_transaction_executable(), or can this check be skipped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Integration] [Prologue execution] During multisig prologue execution, is there validation that the transaction signer matches the multisig_address, or can any account trigger execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Integration] [Payload hash verification] When transaction_payload is Some, does the VM verify it matches the on-chain stored hash, or is the provided payload blindly executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Integration] [Signature threshold] Can an attacker submit a Multisig transaction that executes with fewer signatures than the account's threshold by exploiting None payload handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Integration] [Sequence number] Does a multisig transaction consume sequence numbers from the multisig account or the transaction sender, and can this be exploited for replay attacks? (High)",
