  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [All] [Error Handling Timing] Do error creation, classification, and handling operations have consistent timing characteristics, or could timing-dependent error behavior cause non-determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError] [Variant Addition] If new SafeNativeError variants are added in future upgrades, could this break compatibility with existing native functions or cause deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: LimitExceededError::from_err()] [StatusCode Evolution] If new StatusCode variants are added to PartialVMError, does from_err() fail safely or could new codes be misclassified as InvariantViolations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Function: LimitExceededError::from_err()] [Edge Case Coverage] Are all six limit-related StatusCodes (OUT_OF_GAS, EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED, DEPENDENCY_LIMIT_REACHED, MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, TOO_MANY_TYPE_NODES, VM_MAX_VALUE_DEPTH_REACHED) properly tested for correct classification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError::FunctionDispatch] [Argument Ordering Validation] Is there paranoid mode testing that validates argument ordering is preserved exactly as documented in the comment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError::Abort] [Error Convention Enforcement] The comment says Abort should follow the same error convention as regular Move functions - is this convention enforced, or can native functions violate it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError::LimitExceeded] [SafeNativeContext::charge() Bypass] Are there static analysis tools or runtime checks preventing native functions from manually returning LimitExceeded instead of using SafeNativeContext::charge()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/errors.rs] [Enum: SafeNativeError::FunctionDispatch] [Alternative Implementation Risk] The comment warns against alternative FunctionDispatch implementations - are there safeguards preventing unsafe implementations from being introduced? (Medium)"
