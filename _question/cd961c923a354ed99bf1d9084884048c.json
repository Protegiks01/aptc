  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_MAX_WAIT_MS] [Timeout DoS] Can the DEFAULT_MAX_WAIT_MS (60000ms) be exploited to cause clients to wait too long for transactions, enabling denial-of-service attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS] [Polling Attack] Does DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS (1000ms) allow for excessive polling that could overwhelm servers when many clients wait for transactions simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: RESOURCES_PER_CALL_PAGINATION] [Resource Exhaustion] Can RESOURCES_PER_CALL_PAGINATION (9999) cause memory exhaustion when retrieving accounts with many resources, leading to OOM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: MODULES_PER_CALL_PAGINATION] [Module Enumeration] Does MODULES_PER_CALL_PAGINATION (1000) enable attackers to efficiently enumerate all modules in the system, facilitating reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PepperRequest] [Sensitive Data Exposure] Does PepperRequest properly protect sensitive fields like epk_blinder during serialization, or can they be logged or exposed through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ProverRequest] [Pepper Reuse] Can the pepper field in ProverRequest be reused across multiple proof requests, breaking the security properties of the keyless authentication system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ProverResponse] [Training Wheels Validation] Does ProverResponse properly validate the training_wheels_signature, or can it be omitted or forged to bypass security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [URL Parameter Injection] Can the with_transactions boolean parameter be manipulated through URL injection to bypass query parameter validation at line 179? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_account_events()] [Event Stream Manipulation] Can an attacker craft malicious struct_tag values at line 1365 containing URL encoding bypasses to access unauthorized event streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: build_url_for_pagination()] [Query Parameter Pollution] Can attackers pollute query parameters in build_url_for_pagination() at line 1843 to cause parameter precedence issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_full_block_by_height_bcs()] [Transaction Vector Manipulation] Can the transactions vector unwrap at line 240 panic if the server returns None, causing client crashes and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: submit_bcs()] [Empty Response Attack] Does submit_bcs() properly handle empty BCS responses at line 624, or can malicious servers cause deserialization failures through empty data? (Low)"
