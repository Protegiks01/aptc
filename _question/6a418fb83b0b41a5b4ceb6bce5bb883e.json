  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Filter::enabled()] [Consensus module filtering] If consensus-critical modules like 'consensus::safety_rules' are incorrectly filtered due to prefix matching issues, could this hide Byzantine behavior or safety violations from logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::with_env()] [Config injection] Can attackers who compromise validator deployment scripts inject malicious RUST_LOG or custom environment variables that enable trace logging of state storage operations, exposing Merkle tree internals?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Filter::enabled()] [Path traversal] Can module paths containing '..' or other path traversal sequences at line 141 bypass the starts_with() check, allowing logging of parent modules that should be filtered? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: Builder::parse()] [Silent error suppression] Does filter_map(Result::ok) at line 101 make debugging difficult by silently discarding all parsing errors, potentially masking security misconfigurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/filter.rs] [Function: LevelFilter::from_str()] [Error propagation] When FilterParseError is returned at line 37, does the calling code handle this gracefully, or could parsing failures during startup cause validator panics? (High)",
