  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Race condition] Can concurrent threads race to set state_checkpoint_output via set_state_checkpoint_output() before it's initialized, causing one thread's data to be silently dropped and leading to state inconsistency across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_state_checkpoint_output()] [Panic-based DoS] Can an attacker trigger the panic in set_state_checkpoint_output() by calling it twice on the same PartialStateComputeResult instance, causing validator nodes to crash and resulting in loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_ledger_update_output()] [Panic-based DoS] Can a malicious code path call set_ledger_update_output() multiple times on the same object, triggering the panic and crashing validator processes during epoch reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: ensure_state_checkpoint_output()] [State inconsistency] If ensure_state_checkpoint_output() is called before set_state_checkpoint_output(), can this cause validators to have different error handling paths and produce divergent state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: ensure_ledger_update_output()] [State inconsistency] Can the timing of when ensure_ledger_update_output() is called versus when set_ledger_update_output() completes lead to some validators seeing uninitialized state while others see initialized state, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing initialization] Does new() leave state_checkpoint_output and ledger_update_output uninitialized, allowing execution to proceed without these critical components and potentially causing invalid state commits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Initialization bypass] Can an attacker exploit the difference between new() and new_empty() initialization patterns to create PartialStateComputeResult instances that bypass validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Double-set prevention] In new_empty(), the code expects OnceCell::set() to succeed on first attempt - can race conditions or concurrent initialization cause this expectation to fail and trigger a panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: has_reconfiguration()] [Reconfiguration detection] Can a malicious validator manipulate execution_output.next_epoch_state to falsely indicate a reconfiguration, causing premature epoch transitions and validator set manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: result_state()] [State access control] Does result_state() provide mutable access to execution_output.result_state, allowing direct modification of ledger state and bypassing validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: ensure_result_state_summary()] [Error propagation] Can ensure_result_state_summary() fail silently or with misleading error messages, causing validators to diverge in their state validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: get_complete_result()] [Partial state commit] Can get_complete_result() return None when ledger_update_output is not set, allowing partial execution results to be committed without proper finalization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: expect_complete_result()] [Panic on incomplete state] Can expect_complete_result() be called before the result is complete, causing validator panics during normal execution and resulting in loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: get_complete_result()] [State checkpoint validation] Does get_complete_result() validate that state_checkpoint_output is set before creating StateComputeResult, or can it panic on the expect() call leading to validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Clone semantics] Since PartialStateComputeResult implements Clone, can cloning an instance with partially-initialized OnceCell fields lead to inconsistent state between the original and cloned objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Does new() validate that the provided ExecutionOutput is non-empty and contains valid state, or can empty/invalid execution outputs be wrapped and propagated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Ledger summary validation] Can new_empty() be called with an invalid or manipulated LedgerSummary, causing the creation of PartialStateComputeResult with corrupted base state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Memory ordering] Since OnceCell provides interior mutability, can weak memory ordering on different CPU architectures cause visibility issues where one thread sets a value but another thread doesn't observe it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_state_checkpoint_output()] [TOCTOU race] Can a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use race occur between checking if state_checkpoint_output is set and actually setting it, allowing multiple threads to pass the check simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_ledger_update_output()] [TOCTOU race] Between the time ensure_ledger_update_output() checks if the value is set and set_ledger_update_output() attempts to set it, can another thread interfere causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Shared mutable state] Can multiple validator threads share references to the same PartialStateComputeResult instance and race to initialize OnceCell fields, causing non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: get_complete_result()] [Concurrent access] If multiple threads concurrently call get_complete_result() while another thread is calling set_ledger_update_output(), can this lead to inconsistent reads of the complete result? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Arc/Send safety] If PartialStateComputeResult is wrapped in Arc and shared across threads without proper synchronization, can concurrent modifications to execution_output cause data races? (High)",
