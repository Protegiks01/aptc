  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Function: into_iter()] [Map Function] The closure on line 185-187 extracts the first element of tuple (ab, ()) - can this pattern matching fail for malformed UniqueMap entries causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Struct: Iter] [Lifetime Safety] Does Iter<'a, T> properly enforce lifetime constraints, or could the iterator outlive the UniqueSet leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities in compiler code? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Function: from_elements()] [Duplicate Handling] Does from_elements() correctly detect all duplicates in the input iterator, or can hash collisions in the underlying BTreeMap allow duplicate keys to be inserted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Function: from_elements()] [Error Propagation] Does from_elements() properly propagate error tuples (T::Key, T::Loc, T::Loc) containing both locations of duplicate elements, or could location information be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Function: from_elements()] [Iterator Consumption] Can from_elements() fail midway through iterator consumption, leaving some elements processed and others not, causing inconsistent compiler state?
