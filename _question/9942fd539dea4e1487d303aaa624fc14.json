  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Concurrent Key Access] Can multiple consensus threads read from certified_apks while add_certified_apk() is writing, causing data races or inconsistent views of the key set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: add_certified_apk()] [TOCTOU Race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use race between the is_some() check and the set() call where another thread modifies the cell, causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Send/Sync Bounds] Are the cryptographic types (ASK, APK, etc.) properly marked Send+Sync, or can improper thread passing cause data races when RandKeys is shared across validator threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [All Structs] [Arc Wrapping] When these types are wrapped in Arc for sharing, can reference counting bugs cause premature deallocation of critical randomness data during consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandMetadata] [Round Arithmetic] Can round number arithmetic (e.g., round + 1 for next round) overflow near u64::MAX, causing validators to wrap to round 0 and accept old randomness? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [Block Commitment Timing] Can randomness be committed to blocks before all validators have contributed shares, allowing early-committing validators to bias the final value by withholding their shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandMetadata] [Epoch Boundary Attack] During epoch transitions, can validators use randomness from the old epoch in the new epoch, mixing validator sets and breaking security assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Config Update Race] Can concurrent on-chain config updates to PerBlockRandomness cause validators to use different randomness values for the same block, causing state divergence? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Drop Safety] When RandKeys is dropped, are secret keys properly zeroed/wiped from memory, or can they remain in memory dumps accessible to attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: add_certified_apk()] [Panic DoS] Can Byzantine validators repeatedly trigger the assert!() in add_certified_apk() with invalid indices, causing validator crashes that halt consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Storage Bloat] Can unbounded growth of the seed Vec<u8> in PerBlockRandomness cause on-chain storage exhaustion, making randomness queries prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Initialization DoS] Can providing extremely large num_validators values cause RandKeys::new() to allocate excessive memory and crash validators during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Type: WVUF] [Pinkas Scheme Security] Can the PinkasWUF implementation have undiscovered cryptographic weaknesses that allow attackers to predict randomness outputs from observing shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Key Entropy] Are the ASK secret key shares generated with sufficient entropy, or can weak randomness during DKG lead to predictable validator keys? (Critical)",
