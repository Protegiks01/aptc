  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Struct: LedgerUpdateOutput] [Serialization] If LedgerUpdateOutput is serialized for network transmission or RPC responses, are all fields (especially accumulator state) serialized correctly, or could deserialization produce different structures causing validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Struct: LedgerUpdateOutput] [API exposure] If LedgerUpdateOutput is exposed through public APIs, could malicious clients send crafted outputs to trigger validation logic repeatedly, causing DoS through expensive ensure_transaction_infos_match() calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Function: new_dummy()] [Feature gate leakage] The new_dummy() function is gated with #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'fuzzing'))] - if the fuzzing feature is accidentally enabled in production builds, could this allow creation of invalid dummy outputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Function: new_dummy()] [Test isolation] If test code using new_dummy() shares state with production code, could test-created dummy outputs leak into production validators' state, causing incorrect accumulator chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Function: ensure_transaction_infos_match()] [Unicode in errors] The error messages use formatted strings with transaction version and info - if TransactionInfo Display implementation contains special characters or is maliciously crafted to be extremely long, could this cause log overflow or denial of service in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/ledger_update_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Derive macro security] The Inner struct uses Default derive - if Default implementation for TransactionInfo or other fields has security issues (e.g., creating invalid hashes), could this propagate through new_empty() and cause initialization vulnerabilities? (Low)"
