  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [ProviderJWKs validation] When local_view is passed to new() at line 32, is it validated for correctness (valid issuer, well-formed JWKs), or can a malformed local_view cause signature verification to fail for all observations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [JWK set size limits] Does ProviderJWKs have size limits on the number of keys or metadata, and can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by submitting observations with extremely large JWK sets that pass the equality check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Byzantine validator collusion] Can f Byzantine validators (where f < n/3) collude to all submit observations with a malicious peer_view that differs from honest validators' local_view, and does the code properly reject these observations or can they reach quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Safety under partial synchrony] If network delays cause honest validators' observations to arrive late, can Byzantine validators exploit the timing to reach quorum first with a malicious view before honest validators can contribute? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Equivocation detection] Does the code detect if a Byzantine validator submits different observations (with different signatures/views) in separate add() calls, or can validators equivocate without penalty? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Sybil attack resistance] Can an attacker create multiple validator identities that all pass the get_voting_power() check at line 69, allowing them to exceed the f < n/3 Byzantine threshold and forge quorum certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Censorship attacks] Can Byzantine validators prevent honest validators' observations from being aggregated by racing to reach quorum first, effectively censoring honest input from the JWK consensus process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [BLS signature security] Does the BLS signature verification at line 87-89 use the correct domain separation tags and curve parameters to prevent signature forgery through related-key attacks or subgroup attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Rogue key attack] When aggregating BLS signatures at line 118, does the implementation protect against rogue key attacks where an attacker chooses their public key based on others' keys to forge aggregated signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Signature grinding] Can an attacker perform signature grinding by submitting many observations with different signature values until one passes verification due to implementation bugs or weak randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Hash-to-curve attacks] If BLS signatures hash messages to curve points, are there vulnerabilities in the hash-to-curve implementation that could allow signature forgery or message manipulation?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Epoch arithmetic] At line 61, epoch comparison uses direct equality - can epoch counter overflow or wraparound cause valid future epochs to appear as past epochs, breaking epoch transition safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Threshold calculation precision] Does quorum_voting_power() use integer division that could cause off-by-one errors in threshold calculation, potentially allowing quorum to be reached with one fewer validator than required? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Partial signatures persistence] Is the PartialSignatures state in inner_state persisted across validator restarts, and can state loss cause honest validators to reject previously accepted observations after restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [State initialization atomicity] Can a validator crash between initializing ObservationAggregationState and beginning to accept observations, leaving the state in an inconsistent state that affects future consensus rounds?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Author parameter trust] At line 51, the sender parameter is provided by the caller - is this value authenticated at the network layer, or can a compromised network component forge sender identities?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/observation_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Message ordering] Does the reliable broadcast protocol guarantee any ordering of observations, and can out-of-order delivery cause signature aggregation to fail or produce inconsistent results?
