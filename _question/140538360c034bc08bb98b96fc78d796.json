  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Panic] Can any of the operations (get_signer_arg, CodeWriter::new, generate_governance_proposal, emitln!) panic under unexpected inputs, causing DoS of the release builder tool during critical upgrade procedures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Error propagation] If generate_governance_proposal returns an error, does the function provide sufficient context about which version upgrade failed and why, or can errors be silently ignored leading to incomplete upgrade deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Resource exhaustion] Can extremely large version.major values (close to u64::MAX) cause memory exhaustion or excessive string allocation in the CodeWriter or format operations, leading to DoS during proposal generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Dependency vulnerability] Does the function trust the return value of get_signer_arg at line 16 without validation, allowing a compromised or buggy get_signer_arg to inject malicious signer arguments into all version upgrade proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Dependency vulnerability] Can a compromised generate_governance_proposal function inject malicious code or modify the proposal body closure at lines 27-35, since the version.rs file has no validation of the returned script content? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Logic error] Does the function verify that generate_governance_proposal correctly wraps the version upgrade logic with proper governance headers/footers, or can it generate proposals that bypass governance entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Import safety] The function imports version module at line 26 with 'aptos_framework::version', but does it validate this maps to the correct on-chain module, or can module shadowing attacks redirect to malicious implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Output validation] The function returns Vec<(String, String)> where the tuple is (name, script), but does it validate that the generated Move script is syntactically valid before returning, or can malformed scripts propagate to governance submission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Output injection] Can an attacker manipulate the returned vector to include multiple version upgrade scripts or additional malicious scripts alongside the legitimate version upgrade, since the function only creates one entry but returns a Vec? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Naming collision] The function uses 'version' as the proposal name at line 38, but does it check for naming conflicts with other proposals in the same release, potentially causing proposal overwrite or execution order issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Memory safety] Does the function properly handle the result vector lifetime and ownership, or can use-after-free or double-free issues occur if the returned Vec is mishandled by the caller? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash collision] If next_execution_hash is provided at line 16, does the function verify it's a valid SHA3-256 hash with sufficient entropy, or can collision attacks allow multiple proposals to chain to the same hash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash preimage] Can an attacker who knows the next_execution_hash precompute version.major values that, when combined with other proposal parameters, produce the same hash, allowing proposal substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Hash verification] Does the function verify that the generated proposal script, when hashed, matches any expected hash values, or can hash mismatches go undetected until proposal execution fails on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Race condition] If multiple threads or processes call generate_version_upgrade_proposal concurrently with different version values, can race conditions in the CodeWriter or result vector cause script corruption or proposal mixing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check to time-of-use vulnerability where the version parameter is validated at proposal generation but the on-chain version changes before proposal execution, allowing obsolete or invalid version upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Thread safety] Does the function use any shared mutable state (e.g., in CodeWriter or imported modules) that isn't properly synchronized, potentially causing data races during concurrent proposal generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Version skipping] Can an attacker craft a proposal that skips multiple versions (e.g., from version 2 to version 100), bypassing intermediate version validation logic or feature flag requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Downgrade attack] Does the function prevent version downgrades where version.major is less than the current version, or does it rely solely on the on-chain check in version::set_for_next_epoch that could be bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Version compatibility] Can a version upgrade proposal specify a version.major value that exceeds APTOS_MAX_KNOWN_VERSION, causing validators running older software to reject blocks or fork the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Feature gating] Does the function validate that the proposed version.major correctly gates expected features, or can it create proposals for versions that enable incomplete or dangerous features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Authorization bypass] Does the function verify that the generated proposal will execute with proper SetVersionCapability, or can it generate proposals that attempt to bypass the capability check in version::set_for_next_epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Signer manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the is_testnet or next_execution_hash parameters to change the signer_arg value, potentially executing version upgrades with insufficient authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Governance bypass] If the generated proposal uses the wrong governance resolution method (resolve vs resolve_multi_step_proposal vs get_signer_testnet_only), can it bypass voting requirements or multisig approvals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/version.rs] [Function: generate_version_upgrade_proposal()] [Ordering violation] If version upgrades must be executed in a specific order relative to other proposals (e.g., framework upgrades, gas schedule updates), does the function enforce or validate this ordering? (High)"
