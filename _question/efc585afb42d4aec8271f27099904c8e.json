  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: account] [System Address Abuse] Can account be set to system addresses like 0x1 or 0x2, allowing attackers to emit events that appear to originate from framework accounts, potentially confusing indexers and causing false attribution of token mutations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: account] [Account Mismatch] Can the account field differ from the actual signer of the transaction emitting this event, allowing one account to emit mutation events on behalf of another account, breaking event authenticity guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: account] [Address Collision] Can account addresses be crafted to collide with existing addresses through birthday attacks on the 32-byte address space, allowing impersonation of legitimate token owners in mutation events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: values] [Value Encoding] Can values contain arbitrary binary data that doesn't match the declared types, causing type confusion when deserializing properties? For example, can values=[0xFF, 0xFF, ...] be declared as types=['bool'], causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: values] [Empty Values] Can individual Vec<u8> entries in values be empty (length 0), representing null or undefined properties? Does this allow attackers to delete properties by setting empty values, bypassing explicit deletion mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: values] [Size Limits] Can values contain entries with gigabytes of data, causing memory exhaustion when validators or indexers attempt to process and store these property values, leading to DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Property Deletion Detection] Can an attacker remove properties by excluding their keys from the keys vector without explicitly marking them for deletion, causing silent property loss that breaks property map consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Property Addition vs Mutation] Does this event distinguish between adding new properties and mutating existing ones? Can attackers claim to mutate properties that don't exist in old_id, bypassing property addition restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: keys, values, types] [Atomic Consistency] If vector lengths are mismatched, can partial property updates occur where some properties are mutated but others are skipped, breaking atomicity guarantees and leaving the property map in an inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: new()] [Vector Capacity] Can an attacker pre-allocate vectors with with_capacity(u32::MAX) but fill them with minimal data, wasting memory allocations and causing memory fragmentation in validator processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Event Spam] Can attackers emit thousands of MutatePropertyMap events per transaction with maximum-sized vectors, overwhelming event indexers and causing them to fall behind chain tip, degrading API query performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: keys] [String Allocation] Can keys contain UTF-8 strings with maximum byte length but minimal character count (e.g., all 4-byte Unicode characters), causing inefficient string allocations and heap fragmentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: values] [Nested Vector Explosion] Can values contain nested Vec<u8> structures where outer vector length is large and each inner vector is also maximally sized, causing quadratic memory consumption (O(n²)) and OOM kills? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module Name Validation] Does the MODULE_NAME 'token' properly enforce that this event can only be emitted from the token module, or can other contracts emit MutatePropertyMap events by copying the struct definition, causing event source confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct Name Collision] Can attackers create a different struct also named 'MutatePropertyMap' in a different module, causing type confusion when events are deserialized based solely on struct name without module qualification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event Version Compatibility] Does MoveEventV2Type guarantee backward compatibility? Can changes to the MutatePropertyMap struct break deserialization of historical events, causing indexer failures when reprocessing old blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Static: MUTATE_PROPERTY_MAP_TYPE] [Type Tag Validation] Can the static MUTATE_PROPERTY_MAP_TYPE be manipulated or shadowed by malicious code to reference a different type, causing type confusion when validating event types during execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Static: MUTATE_PROPERTY_MAP_TYPE] [Type Args Injection] The type_args vector is empty - can attackers exploit type parameter injection in Move to create parameterized versions of MutatePropertyMap that bypass type checking while appearing identical? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Canonical Encoding] Does BCS deserialization enforce canonical encoding? Can attackers create multiple distinct byte sequences that deserialize to the same MutatePropertyMap, causing hash collisions in event deduplication logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization Determinism] Are keys/values/types vectors serialized in insertion order? Can non-deterministic ordering cause different validators to produce different event hashes, breaking consensus on event commitment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Extra Fields] Can BCS bytes contain extra trailing data after the MutatePropertyMap fields that's ignored during deserialization, allowing attackers to hide arbitrary data in events that's parsed by custom tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Serde Attributes] Are there any #[serde()] attributes missing that should enforce validation, such as #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] or #[serde(bound)]? Can missing attributes allow schema evolution attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: keys()] [Reference Safety] The keys() getter returns &Vec<String> - can long-lived references prevent vector deallocation, causing memory leaks in long-running processes that cache MutatePropertyMap events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: values()] [Mutable Access] Does returning &Vec<Vec<u8>> allow internal mutability through interior pointers? Can unsafe code exploit this to modify values after event creation, violating immutability guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: types()] [Clone vs Reference] Should types() return a cloned Vec<String> instead of a reference to prevent aliasing issues where multiple parts of code hold references to the same type vector? (Low)"
