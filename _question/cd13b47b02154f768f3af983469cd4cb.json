  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [CFG: Loop liveness] [Loop variables] Does the analysis correctly handle variables that are live across loop iterations, or can loop-carried dependencies be missed? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [CFG: Branch to same label] [Convergence] Can branches where then_label == else_label cause incorrect join behavior or analysis non-convergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [CFG: Self-loop] [Single-block cycle] Do single-block loops (branching back to themselves) get correct liveness information, or can this cause fixpoint issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [CFG: Multiple predecessors] [Join points] At join points with multiple predecessors, does the analysis correctly merge liveness from all paths, or can some paths be missed? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [Concurrency: Parallel compilation] [Thread safety] If multiple functions are compiled in parallel, can shared data structures or static state cause race conditions in liveness analysis? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [Concurrency: Mutable state] [Interior mutability] Are there any RefCell, Cell, or other interior mutability patterns that could cause data races if the processor is used from multiple threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [AbstractDomain: Lattice properties] [Monotonicity] Does the join operation maintain monotonicity (a ⊑ a ⊔ b), or can non-monotonic joins cause fixpoint iteration to fail? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/livevar_analysis_processor.rs] [AbstractDomain: Lattice properties] [Commutativity] Is the join operation commutative (a ⊔ b = b ⊔ a), or can join order affect results and cause non-determinism? (Critical)"
