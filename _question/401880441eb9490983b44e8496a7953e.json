  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_command_processor()] [Command Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious commands through stdin by crafting input that bypasses the clap parser's validation, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the host system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_command_processor()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU race condition between reading stdin input and parsing the command where an attacker could manipulate the input stream to execute unauthorized shutdown commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_command_processor()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker flood stdin with malformed commands to exhaust memory or CPU resources, causing the workspace server to crash and lose all test data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_command_processor()] [Input Validation] Does the format!() macro at line 61 properly sanitize user input before parsing, or can special characters cause parser confusion or injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_command_processor()] [Error Handling] When stdin reading fails at lines 79-82, does the error message leak sensitive information about the system state or file paths that could aid an attacker? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to shutdown.cancel() from multiple sources (Ctrl-C handler, timeout, command processor) cause race conditions leading to incomplete cleanup or resource leaks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Resource Leak] If shutdown.cancel() is called during Phase 1 service startup (lines 128-180), are all partially-started services properly cleaned up, or could Docker containers/networks persist as zombie resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Double-Free] Can the clean_up_all future be executed multiple times (lines 192-196, 199, 208, 252) leading to double-cleanup attempts that corrupt Docker state or crash the process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [State Inconsistency] When shutdown is triggered during the tokio::try_join! at lines 183-191, is there a window where some services are marked as 'up' while others are being torn down, causing state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Cancellation Safety] Are all the shared futures (fut_node_api, fut_indexer_grpc, etc.) properly cancellation-safe, or can premature cancellation leave services in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Integer Overflow] Can the timeout parameter (u64 at line 262) overflow when converted to Duration::from_secs(), potentially causing immediate timeout or indefinite blocking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Signal Handling] If multiple Ctrl-C signals are received rapidly (line 109), can this cause multiple shutdown.cancel() calls leading to panic or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Timeout Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate system time or tokio runtime to bypass the timeout check at line 113, allowing the workspace to run indefinitely despite the configured limit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Race Condition] Is there a race between the timeout expiration (line 113) and Ctrl-C handler (line 109) that could cause duplicate shutdown messages or missed cleanup steps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Dependency Violation] Can services start in the wrong order if tokio::try_join! at lines 183-191 doesn't enforce proper dependency sequencing, causing postgres clients to connect before the database is ready? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Deadlock] Can circular dependencies between shared futures (e.g., fut_node_api waiting for fut_postgres while fut_postgres waits for fut_node_api) cause permanent deadlock? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Resource Exhaustion] If all services are started concurrently without resource limits, can this exhaust system file descriptors, ports, or memory causing startup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Partial Startup] If one service in the tokio::try_join! fails while others succeed, is the system left in a partially-initialized state with orphaned processes or Docker containers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_all_services()] [Network Isolation] Does the permanent Docker network created at line 147 properly isolate test environments, or can malicious code in one workspace access another's network? (High)",
