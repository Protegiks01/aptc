  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait bounds: Clone] [Deep vs shallow copy] Do Clone implementations perform deep copies of all cryptographic material, or can shallow copies lead to use-after-free when one instance is dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait bounds: Eq] [Timing attack] Do Eq implementations use constant-time comparison for cryptographic material, or can timing differences leak key/signature bits through equality checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait bounds: Hash] [Hash collision in collections] Can Hash implementations be exploited to create malicious keys that hash to the same value, causing HashMap/HashSet collisions and DoS in validator sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Trait bounds: Debug] [Key material leakage] Does the Debug bound cause accidental logging of private keys or sensitive material in debug builds or error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Lifetimes: for<'a> quantifiers] [Lifetime escape] Can the for<'a> quantifiers in TryFrom and From implementations be exploited to escape lifetime bounds and create dangling references to cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Borrowing: &[u8] slices] [Slice bounds] Do all TryFrom<&[u8]> implementations properly bounds-check slice lengths, or can out-of-bounds access occur during key/signature deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Borrowing: Reference invalidation] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent threads invalidate references passed to verify() or sign() while these operations are in progress, causing use-after-free or data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/traits/mod.rs] [Error handling: CryptoMaterialError propagation] [Error downgrade] Can error type conversions or match statements accidentally downgrade critical errors to less severe ones, bypassing security checks? (High)"
