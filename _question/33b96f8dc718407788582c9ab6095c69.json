  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/errors.rs] [Error: CTVerifyError::AssociatedDataDoesNotMatch] [Replay Attack] When associated data verification fails, is the ciphertext permanently marked as invalid, or can it be replayed later with correct associated data for malicious purposes?
