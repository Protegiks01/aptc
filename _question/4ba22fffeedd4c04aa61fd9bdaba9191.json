  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: CREATE_DATA_STREAM] [Stream exhaustion] If stream creation is rate-limited based on this counter, can integer overflow or race conditions bypass the rate limiting and allow Byzantine validators to create unlimited streams that exhaust system resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: SENT_DATA_REQUESTS] [Request flooding detection] If this metric is used to detect request flooding attacks, can attackers manipulate the counter through label cardinality attacks to hide their flooding behavior across many labels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: SENT_DATA_REQUESTS_FOR_MISSING_DATA] [Gap detection] If missing data requests are tracked separately to detect gaps in the blockchain, can metric manipulation prevent detection of critical data gaps that lead to validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: RETRIED_DATA_REQUESTS] [Retry storm] If retry behavior is adjusted based on this metric, can manipulation cause either excessive retries (resource exhaustion) or insufficient retries (data sync failures)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall metrics system] [Blind spot creation] Can sophisticated attackers identify which operations are not metered and exploit those blind spots to conduct attacks that leave no trace in the monitoring system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall metrics system] [Metric overload] Can attackers flood the metrics system with high-cardinality label combinations that overwhelm the monitoring infrastructure, causing metrics collection to lag or fail and hiding concurrent attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall metrics system] [Time-series manipulation] If metrics are exported to time-series databases, can attackers craft patterns that exploit aggregation or downsampling algorithms to hide attack signatures in the historical data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION_STREAM] [Subscription flood] If subscription stream creation is not properly rate-limited and relies on this metric for monitoring, can attackers create unbounded subscriptions that exhaust resources without triggering alerts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: TERMINATE_SUBSCRIPTION_STREAM] [Termination tracking] If subscriptions are terminated abnormally but the termination_reason label is not properly set, can this cause operators to miss patterns indicating systematic subscription failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: MAX_CONSECUTIVE_REQUESTS_LABEL] [Hardcoded label] Is this constant properly validated everywhere it's used, or can misuse with other labels cause metric lookup failures that prevent proper termination tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall architecture] [Cascade failure] If a metric collection failure causes the data streaming service to panic or hang, can this cascade to other state sync components and cause network-wide synchronization failures affecting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall architecture] [Performance overhead] Can the overhead of metric collection itself become a bottleneck during high-load scenarios, causing state sync to lag and validators to fall behind, potentially affecting their ability to participate in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Overall architecture] [Metric-based decisions] If state sync protocol decisions (like switching between fast sync and transaction streaming) are based on these metrics, can metric inaccuracies cause suboptimal protocol choices that degrade performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Function: set_subscription_stream_lag()] [Wrap-around behavior] When subscription lag approaches u64::MAX versions (which could happen with very long sync periods), can the conversion to i64 cause wrap-around that makes the lag appear to decrease instead of increase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Function: observe_duration()] [Clock skew] If system clocks are adjusted backwards during state sync operations, can start_time.elapsed() return unexpected values that cause panics or incorrect latency measurements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All metrics] [Registry poisoning] If an attacker gains temporary access to the metrics registry (e.g., through a compromised monitoring agent), can they deregister or modify metrics to hide ongoing attacks or cause monitoring blind spots? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Function: start_timer()] [String allocation] Does the String label parameter cause unnecessary allocations on every timer start, and can high-frequency timer operations cause memory pressure that degrades state sync performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: RECEIVED_RESPONSE_ERROR] [Error suppression] If error counting itself can fail (e.g., due to metric system issues), can this create a scenario where errors go completely untracked, causing failures to accumulate silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: DATA_REQUEST_PROCESSING_LATENCY] [Label set size] If request_type labels are derived from enum-like types, is there protection against enum expansion that could later cause cardinality explosions when new request types are added? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: RECEIVED_DATA_RESPONSE_CHUNK_SIZE] [Multi-dimensional cardinality] With both request_type and response_type labels, can the cartesian product of possible label values create excessive cardinality that exhausts storage even with legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All Lazy metrics] [Initialization order] If metrics are accessed before the underlying metrics system is fully initialized, can Lazy::new() initializations fail in ways that are not properly handled by the unwrap() calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All Lazy metrics] [Static initialization] Can the static initialization of Lazy metrics cause issues during testing or when multiple instances of the data streaming service run in the same process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All metrics] [Prometheus limits] Do the metrics respect Prometheus cardinality best practices (typically <10 label values per dimension), or can unbounded label values cause Prometheus scraping to fail or become extremely slow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All histograms] [Bucket count limits] With custom bucket configurations, can the total number of buckets across all histograms exceed Prometheus memory limits and cause metrics scraping failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/metrics.rs] [All metrics] [Metric name conflicts] If metric names conflict with other Aptos subsystems or are reused with different label sets, can this cause registration failures or metric data corruption? (Low)"
