  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-resource-viewer/src/fat_type.rs] [Global] [Send/Sync bounds] Are FatType and FatStructType properly marked as Send/Sync, or can they be incorrectly shared across threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-resource-viewer/src/fat_type.rs] [Global] [Primitive confusion] Can primitive types (u8, u64, etc.) be confused with each other during serialization/deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-resource-viewer/src/fat_type.rs] [Global] [Reference confusion] Can Reference and MutableReference be swapped, breaking Move's borrowing rules? (Critical)",
