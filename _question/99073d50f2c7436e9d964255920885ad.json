  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Type: CompilerDriverResult] [Result unpacking] At line 31, CompilerDriverResult is defined as anyhow::Result. Can an attacker cause the Ok variant to contain malformed data that passes type checking but causes runtime errors during unpacking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [External checks ordering] External checks at line 89 are passed to build_all(). Does the order of execution matter, and can an attacker exploit ordering dependencies to bypass security validations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Writer state corruption] If the writer at line 87 maintains internal state, can multiple compilation calls corrupt this state, leading to information leakage or garbled output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: create()] [Root package validation] The root field is set to resolution_graph.root_package.package.name at line 53.

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: clean()] [Ends_with bypass] At line 157, path.ends_with() is used for matching.

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Tuple destructuring] At line 127, the result is destructured into (compiled, model).

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Supply chain attack] Can an attacker compromise a legitimate dependency package after resolution but before compilation, injecting malicious code that gets compiled into all dependent packages across the entire validator network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Determinism violation] Do all validators produce identical bytecode given the same source and configuration, or can subtle differences in compilation environment (filesystem, timing, etc.) cause non-deterministic outputs leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: clean()] [Storage exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly trigger compilations that create packages but prevent cleanup, gradually filling validator disk space until compilation fails and prevents network upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Rollback safety] If compilation succeeds but subsequent operations fail, can this leave the validator with partially deployed packages that break module initialization or create exploitable inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Version confusion] Can an attacker exploit differences between source and bytecode compilation paths to deploy modules with mismatched versions, enabling type confusion attacks in the Move VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: create()] [Graph traversal DoS] Can an attacker create a resolution graph that is valid but causes exponential time complexity in toposort, effectively DoSing validator compilation pipelines during critical upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Arc reference leak] Are there scenarios where Arc references to the resolution graph prevent memory from being freed, causing gradual memory leaks that eventually crash validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: clean()] [Inode exhaustion] Can an attacker create thousands of small package files that exhaust filesystem inodes even if total disk space is available, preventing legitimate package compilation?

Can an attacker exploit this to deploy packages with no dependencies, bypassing security checks that assume certain framework modules are always present? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/build_plan.rs] [Function: compile_with_driver()] [Zero dependencies] If transitive_dependencies is empty at line 99, does compilation still proceed correctly, or can this cause validators to deploy modules without required framework dependencies?
