  "[File: source_map.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Type Parameters] What happens when type_parameters.len() approaches usize::MAX - can this cause integer overflows in index arithmetic? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Edge Case] [Variant Overflow] For enum variants, can variant indices exceed u16::MAX causing wraparound when stored as VariantIndex? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Edge Case] [Module Name Edge Cases] Can module names with special characters like '.' or '/' cause issues when converted to Identifier? (Low)",

  "[File: utils.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Files] Can empty source map files (0 bytes) cause bcs::from_bytes() to panic instead of returning an error? (Low)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Concurrency] [Mutable Access] If multiple threads call add_code_mapping() concurrently on the same SourceMap, can BTreeMap mutations cause data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Concurrency] [Iterator Invalidation] Can concurrent modifications invalidate iterators in get_code_location()'s range query causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: marking.rs] [Concurrency] [HashMap Mutations] Are HashMap insertions in mark_code_offset() thread-safe, or can concurrent marking cause lost updates? (High)",
  "[File: mapping.rs] [Concurrency] [Option Replacement] Can with_marks() and with_source_code() be called concurrently, and if so, can this cause torn reads of Option values? (Medium)",
  "[File: utils.rs] [Concurrency] [File System Race] Can concurrent source_map_from_file() calls on the same file cause file system contention or corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Panic Safety] [Unwrap Usage] The code uses .unwrap() in Identifier::new() - can malformed module names cause panics in validators? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Panic Safety] [Index Unwrap] Does .get() followed by .unwrap() in various places properly handle None cases, or can missing entries cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Panic Safety] [Integer Cast] Are all 'as TableIndex' and 'as CodeOffset' casts checked to prevent truncation for large values? (Medium)",
  "[File: marking.rs] [Panic Safety] [Assert Macro] The assert! in add_nop_mapping() can panic - is this acceptable in production, or should it return Result? (High)",
  "[File: utils.rs] [Error Handling] [IO Errors] Does source_map_from_file() properly differentiate between file-not-found, permission-denied, and corruption errors? (Low)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Type Safety] [Index Types] Can FunctionDefinitionIndex be confused with StructDefinitionIndex due to both wrapping TableIndex internally? (High)",

  "[File: source_map.rs] [Type Safety] [Newtype Pattern] Are CodeOffset, MemberCount, and LocalIndex distinct enough types to prevent arithmetic between incompatible indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: marking.rs] [Type Safety] [Index Consistency] When marking code offsets, is type safety enforced to prevent marking with wrong index types? (Medium)",
