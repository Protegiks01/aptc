  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/invalid-mutations/src/helpers.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Semantic correctness] Does the implementation guarantee 'without duplication' per line 9, or could hash collisions in BTreeSet allow duplicates in the final Vec? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/invalid-mutations/src/helpers.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Semantic correctness] Is 'uniformly randomly' at line 9 achieved by Floyd's F2 algorithm as implemented, or could implementation deviations introduce bias? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/invalid-mutations/src/helpers.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Semantic correctness] When indexes_len > max per line 11, should it return all source indexes or all destination indexes [0..max)? The implementation returns destination indexes - is this correct for mutation testing? (Medium)"
