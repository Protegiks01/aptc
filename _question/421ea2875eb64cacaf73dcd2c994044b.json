  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Test module] [Error handling gap] Tests call sender.push().unwrap() without testing failure scenarios - what happens if push() fails due to receiver being dropped? Can this cause panics in production or leave notifications undelivered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Clone semantics] The Sender type from aptos_channel can be cloned - can multiple cloned senders cause race conditions where concurrent push() operations for the same PeerId result in non-deterministic LIFO eviction, causing security-critical notifications to be dropped unpredictably? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Backpressure absence] Since LIFO with capacity 1 silently drops messages without backpressure, can a slow receiver processing loop allow an attacker to flood the sender with connection events, ensuring that all critical notifications are dropped before they can be processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Send failure handling] When Sender::push() returns an error (receiver dropped), does the PeerManager handle this gracefully, or can it lead to a state where connection events are silently lost, causing validators to have incomplete peer views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Multiple senders attack] Can multiple components obtain Sender clones and push conflicting connection notifications for the same PeerId, causing receivers to see inconsistent connection state based on which sender's message arrived last? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Sender ownership] Is there access control on who can obtain a Sender clone? Can unauthorized components push malicious connection notifications to manipulate peer tracking across the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Slow receiver attack] If a malicious or compromised component obtains the Receiver and deliberately processes messages slowly, can this cause the LIFO queue to constantly drop new notifications as they arrive, effectively preventing any connection events from being properly handled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Receiver drop] If the Receiver is accidentally dropped or crashes, what happens to pending connection notifications? Can this cause senders to block or panic, leading to denial of service in the peer management system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [select_next_some() timing] The test uses select_next_some().await which blocks until a message arrives - can an attacker exploit this by never sending messages, causing receivers to hang and preventing connection event processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Message processing order] Does the Receiver guarantee that messages from different PeerIds are processed fairly in round-robin fashion, or can an attacker with many PeerIds starve processing of legitimate validator connection notifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Single receiver assumption] The channel returns a single Receiver - can this become a bottleneck where one slow component blocks all connection event processing across the entire system, affecting network liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Multiple handlers vulnerability] Since PeerManager maintains Vec<conn_notifs_channel::Sender>, can an attacker cause one handler's slow processing to affect all other handlers by filling the shared LIFO queue, causing critical handlers like ConnectivityManager to miss connection events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Handler failure propagation] When PeerManager's send_conn_notification() fails to push to a handler (line 702), it only warns - can repeated failures cause connection events to be systematically lost for certain handlers while others receive them, leading to inconsistent network state views? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [NewPeer/LostPeer race] When PeerManager sends NewPeer in add_peer() and LostPeer in handle_connection_event(), can network timing cause these to arrive out of order at receivers due to LIFO semantics, making receivers think a peer is connected when it's actually disconnected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Notification amplification] Can a malicious peer repeatedly connect/disconnect to cause PeerManager to push multiple NewPeer/LostPeer notifications, amplifying the message dropping effect of LIFO and preventing other peers' notifications from ever being processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Integration] [Handler registration timing] If connection_event_handlers are registered after connections are already established, can this cause handlers to miss initial NewPeer notifications, leaving them with incomplete peer state during critical consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory leak] Since PerKeyQueue garbage collects empty queues every 50 pops, can an attacker create many transient peer connections that create per-key queues but never reach the GC threshold, causing unbounded memory growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [HashMap growth] Does the underlying PerKeyQueue's HashMap<PeerId, VecDeque> have any size limits? Can an attacker with unlimited PeerId generation capability cause the hash map to grow indefinitely, exhausting node memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender/Receiver] [Clone proliferation] Can unlimited cloning of Sender instances cause reference counting overhead or memory leaks if senders are never properly dropped, especially in long-running validator nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: ConnectionNotification] [ConnectionMetadata size] Does ConnectionNotification::NewPeer/LostPeer contain large ConnectionMetadata structures? Can repeatedly dropping these messages in the LIFO queue cause performance degradation or memory allocation pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [Counter absence] With counters set to None, can the lack of monitoring for enqueued/dequeued/dropped metrics prevent detection of resource exhaustion attacks where messages are systematically dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender] [Send-Sync bounds] Are the Sender and Receiver types properly Send + Sync? Can improper use across async tasks or threads cause data races when pushing/receiving connection notifications concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Receiver] [Async cancellation] If an async task receiving notifications is cancelled mid-processing, can this leave the channel in an inconsistent state where some connection events are partially processed, causing peer state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel closure] When the Receiver is dropped, does the Sender::push() fail gracefully, or can it panic or block indefinitely, causing the peer manager to hang when trying to send connection notifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/conn_notifs_channel.rs] [Type: Sender/Receiver] [Tokio runtime dependency] Does the channel require a specific async runtime? Can mixing runtimes or blocking operations in async contexts cause deadlocks when sending/receiving connection notifications? (Low)"
