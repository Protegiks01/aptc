  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Feature flag bypass] Can an attacker exploit the conditional compilation logic to cause runtime crashes by manipulating the 'indexer' feature flag at build time, potentially causing nodes with different feature configurations to behave inconsistently during bootstrap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Build configuration attack] If different validators compile with different feature flag settings for the 'indexer' feature, can this lead to non-deterministic node behavior or consensus failures where some nodes index transactions and others don't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Configuration inconsistency] Can inconsistent deployment of indexer-enabled vs indexer-disabled nodes create a network partition where nodes fail to synchronize due to different internal state management, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Conditional compilation vulnerability] Does the non-indexer version that always returns Ok(None) properly validate that node_config doesn't have indexer enabled, or can there be a mismatch where config expects indexer but binary doesn't support it, causing silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Parameter injection] Can malicious node_config values be injected through the NodeConfig parameter that bypass validation in this wrapper function but exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying bootstrap_indexer_stream function? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Chain ID manipulation] Can an attacker pass a manipulated ChainId parameter that doesn't match the actual chain, causing the indexer to process transactions from the wrong chain or mix transaction data across chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [DbReader tampering] If the Arc<dyn DbReader> trait object is compromised or points to a malicious implementation, can this lead to indexer processing corrupted blockchain data, potentially causing state inconsistencies or fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Mempool client attack] Can a malicious MempoolClientSender be injected that intercepts or manipulates mempool communication, allowing an attacker to censor transactions or inject fake transactions into the indexer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Config validation bypass] Are NodeConfig values validated before being passed to bootstrap_indexer_stream, or can malicious config values (e.g., SQL injection strings in postgres_uri) propagate unchecked? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Error propagation] When bootstrap_indexer_stream returns an Err variant wrapped in Some, is the error properly handled by calling code, or can uncaught errors cause node crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Panic on unwrap] Does the pattern match on the returned Option handle all possible states correctly, or can edge cases cause panics when unwrapping the inner Result? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Silent failure] When bootstrap_indexer_stream returns None, does this silently disable indexer functionality without proper logging or alerting, potentially hiding critical configuration errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Error type confusion] Can the anyhow::Error returned from this function mask critical security errors as generic failures, preventing proper incident response when indexer compromise occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Result unwrapping safety] When transforming Option<Result<T>> to Result<Option<T>>, are all error paths properly preserved, or can critical errors be converted to Ok(None) masking failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Runtime leak] If the returned Option<Runtime> is dropped without proper cleanup, can this leak the tokio runtime and its associated threads, potentially exhausting system resources over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Resource exhaustion] Can repeated calls to bootstrap_indexer create multiple runtime instances without cleaning up previous ones, leading to resource exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Runtime termination] When the node shuts down, does the Runtime properly terminate all spawned indexer tasks, or can orphaned tasks continue to access database resources after shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Concurrent initialization] Can bootstrap_indexer be called multiple times concurrently by different parts of the node initialization code, creating race conditions in runtime creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Arc reference count overflow] Can repeated cloning of the Arc<dyn DbReader> during indexer operations cause reference count overflow, potentially leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Trait object safety] Does the dyn DbReader trait object properly enforce memory safety guarantees, or can virtual method calls through the trait object be exploited if the underlying implementation is malicious?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Upstream vulnerabilities] Does this wrapper function properly sanitize or validate inputs before passing them to bootstrap_indexer_stream, or are all vulnerabilities in the underlying implementation directly exploitable through this interface? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [Return value validation] When bootstrap_indexer_stream returns Some(Ok(runtime)), is the runtime validated to ensure it was properly initialized, or can a corrupted runtime be returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/indexer.rs] [Function: bootstrap_indexer()] [API contract violation] If the calling code in services.rs expects certain guarantees about the returned Runtime but this function doesn't enforce them, can this lead to undefined behavior? (Medium)"
