  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: new()] [Parameter validation] Does new() validate that listen_addr is not 0.0.0.0:0 or other invalid addresses that could cause binding failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Service name validation] Can message_type contain null bytes or other special characters that cause parsing issues downstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Runtime validation] Does start() validate that Runtime rt is in a valid state and not shutting down? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Transaction boundaries] Can messages be sent partially if the task is cancelled mid-send, violating atomicity requirements? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Task cancellation] Can the spawned task be cancelled, and if so, does it leave resources in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Stop signal timing] Is there a race between processing stop_task and sending other messages, potentially losing messages during shutdown? (Medium)",
