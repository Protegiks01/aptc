  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Metadata forgery] Can Byzantine validators forge FullRandMetadata that appears to come from honest validators' blocks, enabling them to inject false randomness shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Liveness guarantee] If conversion of blocks to FullRandMetadata fails or produces wrong values, can this permanently halt randomness generation and block consensus progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Safety violation] Can incorrect FullRandMetadata from conversion cause validators to generate conflicting randomness values for same round, violating safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Deadlock] Could certain Block field values cause the conversion to produce FullRandMetadata that triggers deadlocks in randomness state machine? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Logging] Does the conversion log enough information to debug metadata-related issues, or could silent conversion failures make randomness bugs hard to diagnose? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Metrics] Are there metrics tracking conversion success/failure rates, and could missing metrics hide systematic metadata corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: From<&Block>::from()] [Testing] Is the conversion thoroughly tested with adversarial Block inputs (e.g., fuzzing), or could untested edge cases harbor vulnerabilities? (Medium)"
