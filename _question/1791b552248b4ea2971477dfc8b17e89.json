  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Dependency: serde_json] [Deserialization vulnerability] Are there known vulnerabilities in the serde_json version used for parse_from_json() that could enable arbitrary code execution or DoS through malicious JSON? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Dependency: poem-openapi] [Trait contract violations] Does poem-openapi properly validate all trait implementations generated by these macros, or can trait contract violations cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Test: test()] [Edge case coverage] Does the single test case only verify percent-encoded angle brackets, or are there untested edge cases (null bytes, Unicode, control characters) that could reveal vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Test coverage] [Missing negative tests] Are there security-focused negative test cases verifying rejection of malicious inputs (overflows, injection attacks, malformed data), or do tests only cover happy paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Test: test()] [Type safety validation] Does the test verify that parse_from_parameter() correctly enforces type constraints, or can untested type conversions bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: percent_encoding] [API surface exposure] Does re-exporting percent_encoding expose additional URL encoding functions that could be misused to bypass validation in other parts of the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_type!] [Spec type configuration] Can incorrect $spec_type literals ('string', 'object') in macro invocations cause OpenAPI clients to send wrong data types that bypass server-side validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Documentation] [Misuse potential] Do the macro documentation comments clearly warn about security implications of incorrect usage, or can developers unknowingly create vulnerabilities by applying these macros to sensitive types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_type!] [Example code safety] Does the HexEncodedBytes example in the documentation demonstrate proper input validation, or could developers copy insecure patterns into production code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_parameter!] [Transaction API abuse] Can manipulated percent-encoded parameters in transaction submission API endpoints bypass mempool validation, allowing malformed transactions that crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_type!] [Account API injection] For account query endpoints using these types, can malicious JSON payloads manipulate account addresses to leak information about system accounts or validator states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_type!] [State query manipulation] Can OpenAPI type manipulation enable unauthorized state queries that reveal pending transactions, validator voting patterns, or consensus round information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_parameter!] [Module identifier injection] Can percent-decoded Move module identifiers (0x1::module) be manipulated to access internal system modules or bypass module visibility restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-openapi/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: impl_poem_type!] [Resource handle manipulation] For types representing resource handles or storage keys, can JSON deserialization enable manipulation of Merkle tree paths or storage addresses to access unauthorized data? (Critical)"
