  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Type Confusion] Does Options::create_from_args at line 25 properly validate all parsed option types, or can type confusion bugs allow attackers to pass unexpected types (e.g., passing arrays where strings are expected) causing panics or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Integer Overflow] Can Options::create_from_args accept numeric arguments (e.g., --timeout, --memory-limit) with values exceeding integer bounds, causing overflow or underflow that disables security limits and allows resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Prover Bypass] Can the empty vec![] passed as the third argument to run_move_prover_v2 at line 33 be exploited by modifying the function to accept experiments that disable safety checks, allowing unverified or malicious Move bytecode to be generated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Error Writer Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the mutable error_writer reference at line 33 to intercept or modify error messages from run_move_prover_v2, hiding verification failures or injecting fake success messages in CI/CD pipelines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Move Compiler Exploit] Does run_move_prover_v2 at line 33 properly sandbox the Move compiler v2 pipeline, or can malicious Move source code trigger compiler bugs leading to arbitrary code execution during proof generation on validator infrastructure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Verification Bypass] Can the options passed to run_move_prover_v2 disable critical verification steps (like bytecode verification, resource safety checks, or invariant proving), allowing Move code with safety violations to pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does run_move_prover_v2 at line 33 enforce timeouts and memory limits when verifying complex Move programs, or can an attacker submit verification jobs that run indefinitely, exhausting validator CPU/memory resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Error Suppression] Can errors from Options::create_from_args at line 25 be silently caught or ignored due to Result unwrapping behavior, allowing the prover to continue with invalid/default options that disable security features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Panic Safety] Does the run() function at lines 23-34 properly handle panics that might occur in Options::create_from_args or run_move_prover_v2, or can unhandled panics leave the prover in an inconsistent state with corrupted verification results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Error Context Loss] When errors propagate from run_move_prover_v2 through the ? operator at line 33, is sufficient context preserved to distinguish between verification failures, compiler errors, and system errors, preventing misclassification of security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Chain Validation] Can malicious error implementations in dependencies cause the error.source() loop at lines 14-17 to dereference invalid pointers or access freed memory, leading to crashes or information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Environment Injection] Does the program validate environment variables accessed by env::args() at line 24 or by Options/run_move_prover_v2, preventing attackers from injecting malicious values through ENV that override security-critical configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Working Directory] Can an attacker exploit the implicit current working directory used by the prover to load configuration files or Move sources from unexpected locations, potentially loading malicious code when running in compromised directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [File Descriptor Leak] Does the StandardStream::stderr() at line 32 properly close file descriptors in all error paths, or can repeated prover invocations exhaust file descriptor limits causing validator nodes to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Temp File Security] Does run_move_prover_v2 create temporary files for intermediate verification artifacts, and if so, are they created with secure permissions preventing other users on shared validator infrastructure from reading sensitive proof data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Argument Count] Does Options::create_from_args handle the case where env::args().collect() returns an empty vector (no arguments), potentially causing array access violations or using uninitialized default options that disable security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Null Byte Injection] Can the args vector at line 24 contain strings with embedded null bytes that truncate file paths or command arguments when passed to C FFI boundaries in underlying libraries, bypassing path validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Argument Encoding] Does the program properly handle non-UTF8 arguments that env::args() might receive on certain platforms, or can encoding errors cause panics that crash the prover during verification of critical Move contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Line: 5] [Unsafe Code] While the file has #![forbid(unsafe_code)] at line 5, can transitive dependencies of Options or run_move_prover_v2 contain unsafe blocks with memory safety violations that could be exploited through crafted inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Borrow Checker] Can the mutable borrow of error_writer at line 33 create aliasing issues if run_move_prover_v2 stores this reference globally or passes it to spawned threads, potentially causing data races or use-after-free? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Drop Safety] Does the StandardStream created at line 32 properly implement Drop to flush buffered errors even when panics occur, or can critical verification errors be lost if the program terminates abnormally? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic Unwinding] Can exceptions/panics from run() propagate through main() without being caught, and if so, does this leave the terminal in a corrupted state with color codes active or terminal settings modified? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply Chain] Can the external dependencies (codespan_reporting, move_prover, atty) be compromised through supply chain attacks, and does this entry point perform any verification of their integrity before use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Version Mismatch] Can version mismatches between the move_prover crate at line 8 and the actual implementation create ABI incompatibilities that cause memory corruption when calling run_move_prover_v2? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Signal Race] Can signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) interrupt the program between lines 31-33, leaving partially initialized logging or prover state that corrupts subsequent verification runs? (Low)"
