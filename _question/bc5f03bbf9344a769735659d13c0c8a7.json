  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Event emission bypass] Can malicious Move modules emit MaximumMutate events without actually changing token maximum supply, causing permanent desynchronization between on-chain state and event data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Event suppression] Can a compromised token module prevent emission of MaximumMutate events during legitimate supply changes, hiding critical token mutations from indexers and users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Event forgery] Can modules other than token_event_store emit MaximumMutate events by manually constructing them, bypassing access control checks in the token framework? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Event translation] In the MaximumMutateTranslator, can malformed events cause panics during V2-to-V1 translation that crash indexer nodes and prevent synchronization with the blockchain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Sequence number] Does the event translation layer properly handle sequence number generation for MaximumMutate events, or can sequence number collisions corrupt event ordering in V1 format? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integration] [Resource lookup] If the TokenEventStoreV1 resource is missing during event translation, does the error handling properly prevent partial state updates that could corrupt indexer databases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Concurrency] [Parallel processing] When multiple transactions emit MaximumMutate events for the same token in parallel execution, can race conditions in Block-STM cause events to be processed in non-deterministic order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Concurrency] [Cache coherency] Do event caches properly synchronize when MaximumMutate events are emitted and consumed concurrently across multiple validator threads, or can stale data cause inconsistent views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Concurrency] [Thread safety] Is the MaximumMutate struct guaranteed to be Send+Sync for safe concurrent access, or can sharing between threads cause undefined behavior in validators processing blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Memory safety] [String lifetime] Can the String fields in MaximumMutate cause use-after-free if event references outlive the transaction context that created them, potentially exposing sensitive memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Memory safety] [Clone cost] Does cloning MaximumMutate events in high-throughput scenarios cause excessive heap allocations that lead to memory fragmentation and performance degradation in validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Memory safety] [Drop implementation] Does MaximumMutate properly clean up resources when dropped, or can leaked events accumulate in memory during long-running validator operation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [API] [Query injection] Can API endpoints accepting collection/token names from MaximumMutate events be exploited through injection attacks if these strings aren't properly sanitized before database queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [API] [Rate limiting] Can attackers flood the network with transactions emitting MaximumMutate events to overwhelm API servers that index and serve this event data to users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [API] [Response size] Can querying MaximumMutate events with very long collection/token strings cause API responses to exceed size limits, triggering errors or truncation that corrupts client applications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [State consistency] [Event-state divergence] Can MaximumMutate events claim a maximum change that contradicts the actual on-chain token maximum stored in state, causing permanent inconsistency between events and resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [State consistency] [Orphaned events] If a transaction emitting MaximumMutate events partially fails after event emission but before state commit, can orphaned events corrupt indexer state that cannot be rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [State consistency] [Cross-transaction consistency] Can events from different transactions affecting the same token interleave in ways that create impossible state transitions (e.g., maximum jumping from 100 to 1000 to 200)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Gas metering] [Event size cost] Is the gas cost for emitting MaximumMutate events proportional to the size of collection/token strings, or can attackers emit huge strings cheaply to bloat event storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Gas metering] [Event count] Can a single transaction emit unlimited MaximumMutate events for low gas cost, overwhelming indexers with event processing load while keeping on-chain execution cost minimal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Performance] [Indexer lag] Can bursts of MaximumMutate events from many simultaneous token mutations cause indexer processing delays that create arbitrage opportunities for attackers monitoring real-time supply changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integrity] [Event tampering] Can MaximumMutate event data be modified after emission but before storage in the event Merkle tree, allowing attackers to alter historical records of token supply changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integrity] [Hash collision] Can two different MaximumMutate events produce the same hash when stored in the event tree, causing one event to overwrite another and hide token mutations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Integrity] [Signature bypass] Does the lack of signature fields in MaximumMutate events mean anyone can claim to have emitted events from arbitrary creator addresses if event validation is bypassed? (Critical)"
