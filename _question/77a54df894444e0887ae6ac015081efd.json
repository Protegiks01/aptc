  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Missing token ID] Since there's no token identifier field, can events from different tokens get conflated by indexers, or can an attacker emit mutation events without any linkage to actual tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization attack] Can differences between BCS serialization and serde's Serialize trait implementation cause the same TokenMutationEvent to have different byte representations, leading to hash mismatches or signature verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Deserialization version skew] If the TokenMutationEvent struct fields are reordered or renamed in future versions, could old events become undeserializable, breaking historical event queries and audit capabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep copy overhead] Since Clone is derived for TokenMutationEvent with String fields, can excessive cloning during event processing cause performance degradation or memory pressure on validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Equality semantics] Do the derived equality implementations correctly handle edge cases like strings with different normalizations (e.g., Unicode normalization forms) that should be considered equal? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: mutated_field_name] [Field name spoofing] Can an attacker emit events with mutated_field_name values that impersonate critical system fields (e.g., 'owner', 'supply') without actually mutating those fields, creating false audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: mutated_field_name] [Case sensitivity] Are field name comparisons case-sensitive, or could an attacker use 'Owner' vs 'owner' to bypass event filters that check for mutations to specific fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: old_value] [Historical forgery] Can an attacker emit events with fabricated old_value data that doesn't match the actual previous state, rewriting history in event logs without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: old_value] [Encoding attacks] Can old_value contain encoded data (base64, hex) that when decoded reveals different information than the string representation suggests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: new_value] [Value validation] Is there any validation that new_value represents a valid state for the claimed mutated_field_name, or can arbitrary invalid values be recorded in events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Field: new_value] [Overflow representation] If new_value represents numeric data as a string, can integer overflow or underflow be hidden by using string representation instead of proper numeric types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Concurrent access] Is TokenMutationEvent safe to access from multiple threads simultaneously, or could concurrent reads of the String fields cause data races if the struct is shared? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [Global state] Can concurrent initialization of TOKEN_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE from multiple threads cause race conditions, despite Lazy's guarantees, if the StructTag construction itself is not thread-safe? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Move contract bypass] Can Move contracts emit TokenMutationEvent without actually performing the corresponding mutation to the token object, creating misleading event streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Access control] Is there any enforcement that only the token module at TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS can emit these events, or can arbitrary contracts emit fake mutation events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Event flooding] Can a malicious contract emit massive numbers of TokenMutationEvent instances to bloat event storage and make legitimate events harder to find, essentially performing a spam attack on the event system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [String mutation] Since String is mutable in Rust, could there be code paths where the internal strings are modified after event creation, violating immutability expectations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic safety] Does bcs::from_bytes() guarantee it won't panic on malformed input, or could specially crafted bytes cause unwinding that leaves the validator in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Memory layout] Could the memory layout of TokenMutationEvent with three String fields cause excessive heap fragmentation when processing large numbers of events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: TokenMutationEvent] [Hash determinism] If TokenMutationEvent is used in cryptographic hashing (e.g., for event proofs), do the String fields guarantee deterministic serialization order across all platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Canonical encoding] Does BCS deserialization enforce canonical encoding, or could the same logical event have multiple valid byte representations, breaking deduplication and signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas metering] Is there proper gas charging for creating TokenMutationEvent instances based on the size of the String fields, or can attackers create large events cheaply? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization cost] Is gas charged proportionally to the complexity of deserializing TokenMutationEvent, or could malformed events that trigger expensive error paths be used to waste validator resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Empty bytes] What happens when try_from_bytes() is called with an empty byte slice - does it return a meaningful error or could it cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty strings] Can new() be called with empty strings for all three fields, creating a semantically meaningless event that passes all type checks but provides no information? (Low)"
