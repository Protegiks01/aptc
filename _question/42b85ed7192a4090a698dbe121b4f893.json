  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: is_internal_indexer_enabled()] [Access Control] Can implementations of this method be manipulated to return false when the indexer is actually enabled, bypassing indexer-dependent security checks and allowing queries against stale or unindexed data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: is_internal_indexer_enabled()] [State Inconsistency] If is_internal_indexer_enabled() returns different values across concurrent calls due to race conditions in implementors, can this lead to TOCTOU vulnerabilities where queries proceed against disabled indexers causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Information Disclosure] Does this method lack access control checks allowing unauthorized callers to retrieve TableInfo for any TableHandle, potentially exposing sensitive table metadata including structure, ownership, and key types that could aid in exploiting table-based vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Data Integrity] Can implementors return fabricated or stale TableInfo for a given TableHandle, causing downstream consumers to operate on incorrect table metadata and potentially accessing wrong table entries or corrupting table state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Input Validation] Is there validation that the TableHandle parameter is well-formed and not constructed with malicious bit patterns that could trigger implementation bugs, integer overflows, or undefined behavior in unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Version Consistency] Does this method enforce version consistency, or can it return TableInfo from a different ledger version than expected, causing mismatches between table metadata and actual table state leading to incorrect queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Integer Overflow] Can the start parameter plus limit parameter cause integer overflow when implementors calculate the end range, potentially wrapping around to return events from incorrect sequence numbers or causing panics that halt indexer queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is the limit parameter unbounded or poorly validated by implementors, allowing attackers to request billions of events in a single call, exhausting memory and causing node crashes or validator slowdowns affecting consensus participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Version Consistency] Can ledger_version parameter be manipulated to query events from future versions that don't exist yet, or from pruned historical versions, causing implementors to return inconsistent or missing event data that breaks API invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Order Bypass] Does the Order enum (Ascending/Descending) get properly validated and enforced by all implementors, or can malicious implementations ignore the ordering requirement and return events in arbitrary order breaking client assumptions and transaction reconstruction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Event Key Validation] Is there validation that the EventKey parameter is legitimate and not crafted to trigger implementation-specific vulnerabilities like path traversal in file-based indexers or SQL injection in database-backed indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Return Value Tampering] Can Byzantine implementors return fabricated EventWithVersion entries with incorrect version numbers, forged event data, or events that never occurred on-chain, breaking event-based application logic and causing fund losses in DeFi protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Boundary Conditions] When start is 0 or u64::MAX, or when limit is 0 or u64::MAX, can this trigger off-by-one errors, slice panics, or undefined behavior in implementors that don't properly handle boundary cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Pagination Attack] Can an attacker exploit the start/limit pagination mechanism to skip events or retrieve duplicate events by manipulating sequence numbers between consecutive queries, breaking event streaming consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [TOCTOU Race] Between checking ledger_version and actually querying events, can the ledger advance causing implementors to return events from a newer version than requested, violating read consistency and causing forks in downstream indexing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_key()] [Integer Overflow] Similar to get_events(), can start_seq_num + limit overflow u64 bounds in implementor calculations, wrapping to negative-equivalent values that return events from incorrect ranges or cause arithmetic panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_key()] [Sequence Number Manipulation] Can attackers provide malicious start_seq_num values that exploit implementor assumptions about sequence number monotonicity, retrieving events out-of-order or from gaps in the sequence causing state reconstruction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_key()] [Duplicate Detection] Is there protection against implementors returning duplicate events when pagination crosses indexer shard boundaries or when concurrent updates occur, potentially double-counting event effects in client applications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_key()] [Event Key Collision] Can crafted EventKey values collide with system-reserved event keys or other users' event keys in implementors using weak hashing, allowing unauthorized access to other accounts' events and breaking privacy guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Proof Validation] Does the returned AccountOrderedTransactionsWithProof contain cryptographically verifiable proofs, or can implementors return unverified transaction lists allowing fabrication of transaction history for any account including validator accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Sequence Number Gap] Can implementors return transactions with gaps in sequence numbers (e.g., skipping seq_num 5) without proper error indication, causing downstream replay logic to fail and transaction history to appear incomplete? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Address Validation] Is the AccountAddress parameter validated to prevent queries for system addresses or reserved addresses that should not be exposed via public APIs, potentially leaking validator transaction history or governance operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Event Inclusion Bypass] When include_events is true, can implementors skip event inclusion or include events from different transactions, breaking the atomic relationship between transactions and their emitted events and causing DeFi protocol failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Limit Bypass] Can implementors ignore the limit parameter and return more transactions than requested, exhausting client memory or network bandwidth in a DoS attack against API consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Version Mismatch] Can ledger_version be inconsistent with the actual versions of returned transactions, causing clients to build incorrect merkle proofs or validate transactions against wrong state roots? (High)"
