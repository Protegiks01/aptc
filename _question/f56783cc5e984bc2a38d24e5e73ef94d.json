  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Event pruning vulnerability] If old DepositFAEvent data is pruned from validator storage but indexers rely on it for balance history, can attackers exploit the pruning window to manipulate historical balance queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Non-atomic emission] Are WithdrawFAEvent emission and actual withdrawal guaranteed to be in the same transaction, or can events be emitted in one transaction with the withdrawal occurring in another, breaking atomicity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Rollback inconsistency] If a transaction containing DepositFAEvent is included in a block that gets later reverted due to a chain reorganization, is the event properly rolled back, or can ghost deposits remain in indexer databases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Partial transaction failure] If a transaction fails after emitting WithdrawFAEvent but before completing (e.g., due to later assertion failure), is the event emission reverted, or does it create orphaned event records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Multi-step transaction vulnerability] In transactions with multiple deposits/withdrawals, if one step fails midway, are all DepositFAEvent emissions rolled back atomically, or can partial events lead to inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Missing amount validation] Is there validation that WithdrawFAEvent.amount is non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can attackers emit events with extreme values (0, u64::MAX) causing edge case bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Unauthorized emission] Can modules other than the authorized fungible_asset module emit DepositFAEvent instances through direct struct construction, bypassing proper authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Store ownership validation] Is there validation that the transaction sender has authority over the store address in WithdrawFAEvent, or can attackers emit events for stores they don't control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Frozen store bypass] Can attackers emit DepositFAEvent for frozen or suspended FungibleStores, bypassing freeze checks and creating misleading balance change records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Field injection] Since Rust struct fields are public, can attackers directly construct WithdrawFAEvent with arbitrary field values outside of the proper event creation flow, bypassing validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Mutable field exploit] Are the store and amount fields in DepositFAEvent immutable after creation, or can they be modified after event construction but before emission, allowing manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent.amount] [Bit manipulation] Can an attacker use unsafe Rust code or FFI to directly manipulate the bit representation of WithdrawFAEvent.amount after creation, bypassing validation checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Silent failure] If create_event_v2() returns an error but the error is ignored or improperly handled, can withdrawals/deposits complete without events being emitted, breaking auditability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Zero amount edge case] How are WithdrawFAEvent instances with amount=0 handled? Can they be used for signaling attacks or to pollute event logs without actual balance changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Maximum amount handling] Is there special handling for DepositFAEvent with amount=u64::MAX, and can this extreme value cause overflow in cumulative balance calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leakage] Does the Debug trait implementation for WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent expose sensitive information in logs that could aid attackers in timing or targeting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Consensus manipulation] Can Byzantine validators selectively omit WithdrawFAEvent from blocks while including deposits, causing divergent balance views across nodes and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Event censorship] Can validator collusion censor specific DepositFAEvent instances while processing the actual deposits, hiding balance increases from public view and enabling insider trading? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Fork divergence] During chain reorganizations, can inconsistent WithdrawFAEvent processing between different chain branches lead to permanent balance inconsistencies requiring hardfork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type system bypass] Can attackers exploit Move VM type system vulnerabilities to cast unrelated structs to WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent, injecting malicious events into the event stream? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Unsafe serialization] If there are unsafe blocks in the Serde serialization code path for WithdrawFAEvent/DepositFAEvent (even in dependencies), can memory corruption lead to event data tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Borrow checker bypass] Can the use of RefCell, Arc, or other interior mutability patterns in event processing code allow mutation of 'immutable' WithdrawFAEvent data, breaking event integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: DepositFAEvent] [Lifetime violation] Can incorrect lifetime annotations in code handling DepositFAEvent lead to use-after-free or dangling reference bugs that corrupt event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Panic in deserialize] Can malicious input cause panics during WithdrawFAEvent deserialization, potentially crashing validators or creating denial-of-service conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/fungible_asset.rs] [Struct: WithdrawFAEvent] [Version incompatibility] If the WithdrawFAEvent structure is modified in a future version (e.g., adding new fields), can old events become unparseable, breaking historical balance reconstruction? (Medium)"
