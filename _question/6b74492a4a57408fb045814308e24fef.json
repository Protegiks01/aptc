  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: DIRECT_SEND] [Protocol downgrade attack] Can a Byzantine validator force protocol negotiation to downgrade from compressed to uncompressed (JSON) format, enabling them to inject larger malicious payloads that bypass size validation checks and cause memory exhaustion in peer validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: RPC] [Protocol confusion] Does the protocol selection mechanism ensure all validators use the same protocol priority order, or can inconsistent protocol preferences across validators lead to message delivery failures causing JWK consensus liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: DIRECT_SEND] [Protocol manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the protocol negotiation to force the use of JWKConsensusDirectSendJson (lowest priority), bypassing compression and enabling larger attack payloads that could exploit deserialization vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: RPC] [Protocol priority bypass] Are there race conditions during protocol negotiation where a malicious peer could inject messages using a deprecated or insecure protocol variant, bypassing security checks implemented in newer protocol versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: DIRECT_SEND, RPC] [Protocol version confusion] Can validators running different versions of the protocol arrays cause message routing failures, where critical JWK consensus messages are silently dropped leading to incomplete quorum formation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate the rpc_timeout parameter to cause indefinite blocking when sending RPC requests to honest validators, effectively DoS'ing the JWK consensus process and preventing quorum certificate formation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Peer impersonation] Does send_rpc() validate that the peer PeerId corresponds to an authorized validator in the current epoch, or can an attacker impersonate any peer address to inject malicious JWKConsensusMsg responses into the consensus process? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response validation bypass] After receiving a JWKConsensusMsg response via send_rpc(), is the response cryptographically validated to ensure it was signed by the claimed peer, or can a man-in-the-middle attacker substitute malicious JWK observations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Epoch confusion attack] Does send_rpc() enforce that the response message's epoch matches the request epoch, or can an attacker replay old JWK observations from previous epochs to manipulate the current consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout race condition] If multiple concurrent send_rpc() calls target the same peer with different timeout values, can race conditions cause some requests to timeout prematurely while others hang indefinitely, leading to inconsistent JWK consensus state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Error handling bypass] When send_rpc() returns an Error, is the error properly propagated and handled, or can silent failures cause validators to incorrectly assume consensus was reached when responses were actually lost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker flood validators with send_rpc() calls containing malformed messages, exhausting network resources and preventing legitimate JWK consensus messages from being processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Message type confusion] Does send_rpc() validate that the received JWKConsensusMsg response matches the expected message type (ObservationRequest/Response/KeyLevelObservationRequest), or can type confusion attacks cause incorrect state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent request collision] If multiple validators simultaneously call send_rpc() to request JWK observations from the same peer, can response collision or confusion cause validators to process incorrect or duplicate observations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Network partition exploitation] During network partitions, can Byzantine validators exploit send_rpc() to selectively respond to certain validators while ignoring others, creating divergent JWK consensus states across network segments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw bytes injection] Can an attacker use send_rpc_raw() to inject arbitrary raw bytes that bypass normal JWKConsensusMsg serialization validation, potentially exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities in the network_client layer? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Deserialization attack] Does send_rpc_raw() perform any validation on the raw Bytes before sending, or can malformed byte sequences cause panic/crashes in receiving validators when they attempt to deserialize invalid JWKConsensusMsg structures?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Signature validation bypass] Since send_rpc_raw() accepts pre-serialized bytes, can an attacker craft raw messages with invalid or missing BLS signatures that bypass signature validation checks expected in normal JWKConsensusMsg handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Protocol confusion attack] Can send_rpc_raw() be used to send messages using a different protocol encoding than expected, causing deserialization mismatches where validators interpret the same bytes differently leading to consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Timeout consistency] Does send_rpc_raw() use the same timeout enforcement as send_rpc(), or can inconsistent timeout handling between raw and structured RPC calls cause unexpected blocking behavior?
