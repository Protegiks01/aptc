  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Block Info Await] Do the three sequential .await calls to block_cache.get_block_info_by_height() create opportunities for blockchain state changes between queries, causing inconsistent NetworkStatusResponse data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Error Propagation] If any of the three block_cache.get_block_info_by_height() calls fail, does network_status() return partial data or properly propagate errors, and could partial failures expose internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: list_route()] [Method Validation] Does list_route() only accept POST requests via .and(warp::post()), but could attackers send other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) that bypass this check due to warp filter ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: list_route()] [Path Traversal] Does list_route() using warp::path!('network' / 'list') properly validate the path, or could URL-encoded path traversal sequences (../../../) bypass routing and access unintended endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: list_route()] [Empty Request Validation] Does list_route() use with_empty_request() that creates MetadataRequest without validation, and could attackers exploit this to send requests with unexpected fields that cause downstream issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: list_route()] [Context Cloning] Does list_route() clone server_context via with_context(), and could high-frequency requests cause excessive memory allocation from repeated Arc cloning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: options_route()] [JSON Parsing] Does options_route() use warp::body::json() to parse request body, and could attackers send deeply nested JSON or extremely large payloads to cause stack overflow or memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: options_route()] [Content-Type Bypass] Does options_route() validate Content-Type header before parsing JSON, or could attackers send non-JSON data with JSON Content-Type to cause deserialization errors or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: options_route()] [Request Size Limit] Does options_route() enforce maximum request body size for warp::body::json(), or could attackers send gigabyte-sized JSON payloads to exhaust server memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: status_route()] [Concurrent Requests] Does status_route() handle concurrent requests safely, or could multiple simultaneous requests cause race conditions in block_cache access leading to inconsistent responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: status_route()] [Timeout Handling] Does status_route() implement request timeouts, or could long-running block_cache queries block the async runtime if blockchain synchronization is slow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Chain ID Validation] Does check_network() from common.rs properly validate ChainId::from_str() parsing, or could attackers send malformed chain IDs that cause panics or bypass validation due to unexpected parsing behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Trim Bypass] Does check_network() use network_identifier.network.trim() which could allow attackers to bypass exact chain ID matching by using leading/trailing whitespace variations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Blockchain String] Does check_network() only validate that network_identifier.blockchain == 'aptos', but could attackers use case variations (Aptos, APTOS) or Unicode lookalikes to bypass this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Module: types] [NetworkIdentifier Construction] Do NetworkIdentifier types allow arbitrary string values for blockchain and network fields, enabling attackers to inject malicious strings that cause downstream issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Module: types] [NetworkListResponse Construction] Does NetworkListResponse construction at line 62-64 properly validate that network_identifiers vector is non-empty, or could empty vectors break client assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Module: types] [Version Construction] Does Version struct at lines 88-93 allow arbitrary strings for rosetta_version and node_version, potentially enabling version injection attacks or breaking semantic versioning assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Error Handling] [Information Disclosure] Do error responses from network_list(), network_options(), and network_status() expose detailed stack traces or internal error messages that reveal server architecture or configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Code Consistency] Do all three network endpoints (list, options, status) return consistent ApiError codes, or could inconsistent error handling enable attackers to fingerprint different code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Propagation] If any function (network_list, network_options, network_status) panics due to unwrap() or expect(), does warp's error handling prevent the panic from crashing the entire API server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Async Cancellation] If a client cancels a network_status() request mid-execution (after rest_client call but before block_cache queries), could this leave block_cache in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_status()] [Async Deadlock] Could concurrent network_status() requests deadlock if block_cache uses locks internally and multiple requests query the same blocks simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Async Runtime] [Task Spawning] Are network endpoint handlers executed on a bounded thread pool, or could unlimited concurrent requests spawn excessive async tasks causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Type Collection Safety] Does OperationType::all() collect all operation types safely, or could enum additions without updating the all() method cause incomplete operation type reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/network.rs] [Function: network_options()] [Status Type Collection] Does OperationStatusType::all() collect all status types safely, or could missing status types cause transaction parsing failures in downstream APIs? (Medium)"
