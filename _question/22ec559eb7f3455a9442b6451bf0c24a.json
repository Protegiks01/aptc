  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the chain_id parameter to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., '../', './') into the returned folder prefix, potentially allowing access to or overwriting of files outside the intended snapshot directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Integer Overflow] If chain_id approaches u64::MAX, could the format!() macro's string allocation fail or cause memory exhaustion when constructing the snapshot folder prefix, leading to denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Collision Attack] Can two different chain_id values produce the same snapshot_folder_prefix string through integer wraparound or formatting quirks, allowing snapshot data from one chain to overwrite or corrupt another chain's data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Format String Injection] Does the format!() macro properly sanitize the chain_id u64 value, or could special formatting of large integers introduce unexpected characters into the folder name that might be interpreted as filesystem commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Resource Exhaustion] If this function is called repeatedly with varying chain_id values in a tight loop, could the String allocations cause memory pressure or heap fragmentation, potentially destabilizing the indexer service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call snapshot_folder_prefix() with the same chain_id simultaneously and then create directories, could this lead to TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities where an attacker swaps the directory between prefix generation and actual usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Naming Ambiguity] Does the prefix pattern 'snapshot_chain_{}_epoch_' create any ambiguity where a malicious actor could craft a folder name that matches this prefix but doesn't follow the expected structure, potentially confusing the backup/restore logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Special Characters] Can chain_id values cause the generation of folder names with special characters (e.g., null bytes, control characters) that might be interpreted differently by different filesystems, leading to inconsistent behavior across platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply crafted chain_id or epoch values that inject directory traversal sequences into the returned folder name, potentially allowing snapshot files to be written to or read from arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Collision Attack] Can two different (chain_id, epoch) pairs produce identical snapshot_folder_name strings, causing one chain's snapshot to overwrite another's and leading to data loss or restoration of incorrect blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Integer Overflow] If both chain_id and epoch are near u64::MAX, could the combined string allocation in format!() fail or cause memory exhaustion, leading to service crashes during critical snapshot operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Epoch Manipulation] If epoch values can be manipulated by an attacker (e.g., through consensus bugs), could they craft epoch numbers that create snapshot folder names overlapping with legitimate snapshots, causing data corruption during backup/restore? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Symlink Attack] After snapshot_folder_name() returns a path, could an attacker create a symbolic link at that location before the snapshot is written, redirecting snapshot data to an attacker-controlled location or sensitive system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Format String] Does the format!() macro properly handle edge cases where chain_id or epoch are 0, u64::MAX, or other boundary values that might produce unexpected string representations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Race Condition] If multiple indexer instances call snapshot_folder_name() concurrently with the same chain_id and epoch, could this lead to race conditions where both try to create/write to the same snapshot directory simultaneously, causing data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Resource Exhaustion] If an attacker triggers rapid epoch transitions (through consensus manipulation), could the repeated calls to snapshot_folder_name() and subsequent snapshot operations exhaust disk space or I/O bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Parsing Ambiguity] When extracting chain_id and epoch from folder names (reverse operation), could the format 'snapshot_chain_{}_epoch_{}' create parsing ambiguities if the separator strings appear in the numeric values themselves? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Cross-Platform] Does snapshot_folder_name() generate folder names that are valid across all supported operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), or could certain chain_id/epoch combinations produce names with invalid characters on some platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Module: backup_restore] [Access Control] By making the backup_restore module public, does this expose internal backup/restore operations that could be called by untrusted code, potentially allowing unauthorized backup creation or restoration operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Module: internal_indexer_db_service] [State Manipulation] Does exposing internal_indexer_db_service publicly allow external callers to directly manipulate the indexer database state, bypassing normal validation and potentially corrupting the table info index? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Module: runtime] [Runtime Manipulation] Does the public runtime module expose functions that could allow external code to interfere with the runtime lifecycle (start/stop/restart), potentially causing service interruptions or data inconsistency? (High)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix() / snapshot_folder_name()] [Inconsistent Usage] If different parts of the codebase construct snapshot folder paths manually instead of using these utility functions, could this lead to naming inconsistencies that cause snapshots to be created in unexpected locations or fail to be discovered during restore?
