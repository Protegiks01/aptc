  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Struct: CommitVote] [Access Control] Can a malicious validator create a CommitVote with a mismatched author field and signature, where the author field points to a different validator than the one who actually signed, potentially allowing vote stuffing or impersonation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Struct: CommitVote] [State Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a CommitVote with a valid signature but manipulated LedgerInfo fields (round, epoch, commit_info) that differ from what was actually signed, bypassing consensus safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Struct: CommitVote] [Memory Safety] Does the CommitVote struct properly handle Clone/PartialEq operations on SignatureWithStatus which contains Arc<AtomicBool>, or could cloning lead to shared mutable state causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Struct: CommitVote] [Serialization Attack] During deserialization, does SignatureWithStatus reset verification_status to false, and could an attacker craft serialized CommitVote data that deserializes with verification_status=true, bypassing signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new()] [Signature Validity] In the new() function (lines 46-57), if validator_signer.sign() returns an error due to invalid key material, does the error propagate correctly or could a CommitVote be created with an invalid/empty signature? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new()] [Author Mismatch] Does new() verify that the author parameter matches validator_signer.author(), or could a validator create a CommitVote claiming to be from a different validator while using their own signing key? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new()] [LedgerInfo Manipulation] Can the ledger_info_placeholder parameter be manipulated before signing to contain different round/epoch/commit_info than intended, allowing validators to vote on incorrect state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new()] [Cryptographic Weakness] Does validator_signer.sign() use deterministic or randomized signing, and could signature malleability allow creation of multiple valid signatures for the same CommitVote enabling double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can repeatedly calling new() with invalid parameters cause memory leaks or resource exhaustion through failed signature operations that don't properly clean up? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Signature Bypass] In new_with_signature() (lines 60-70), since it accepts a pre-computed signature without verification, can an attacker provide an arbitrary invalid signature that only gets checked later, causing vote aggregation to fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Author Spoofing] Does new_with_signature() validate that the provided signature was actually created by the specified author, or can any validator provide any signature claiming to be from any author? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Replay Attack] Can new_with_signature() be used to create multiple CommitVote instances with the same signature but different author/ledger_info fields, enabling signature replay across different contexts? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [SignatureWithStatus Initialization] When creating SignatureWithStatus::from(signature) (line 68), the verification_status is initialized to false - could this interact incorrectly with optimistic verification if the signature was already verified? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Type Confusion] Could an attacker provide a signature that is valid BLS12-381 but signed over different data, and would this be caught before aggregation or could it cause verification failures later? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: author()] [Copy Semantics] Since author() returns Author by value (line 74), does this create unnecessary copies, and could rapid polling of author() cause memory/performance issues in vote aggregation? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: author()] [Race Condition] Can the author field be modified after CommitVote creation through interior mutability, causing author() to return different values at different times? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Immutability] Does ledger_info() return an immutable reference (line 78-80), and can callers modify LedgerInfo through unsafe code or interior mutability patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Data Consistency] Between the time ledger_info() is called and signature verification occurs, could the underlying LedgerInfo be modified, causing TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature()] [Signature Extraction] In signature() (lines 82-85), does extracting the signature from SignatureWithStatus lose the verification status information, potentially causing redundant verification? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature()] [Reference Lifetime] Could the returned &bls12381::Signature outlive the CommitVote, and would this allow use-after-free if the CommitVote is dropped while signature references exist? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Interior Mutability] The comment (lines 88-89) warns about interior mutability - can multiple threads call signature_with_status() and race to set verification_status, causing one thread to trust an unverified signature? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Verification Status Manipulation] Can set_verified() be called on SignatureWithStatus without actually verifying the signature, allowing unverified votes to be treated as verified in aggregation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Memory Ordering] Does SignatureWithStatus use proper memory ordering (SeqCst) when reading/writing verification_status via AtomicBool, or could weak ordering cause visibility issues across threads? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Clone Safety] When SignatureWithStatus is cloned, does the Arc<AtomicBool> get shared, and could this allow one CommitVote to mark another's signature as verified incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Deserialization Reset] After deserializing a CommitVote, is verification_status always reset to false, or could serialized data contain pre-verified status bypassing checks? (Critical)"
