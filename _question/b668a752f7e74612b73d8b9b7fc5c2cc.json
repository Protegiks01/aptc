  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Silent failure propagation] If create_release() returns an Err but the build continues (due to cargo's error handling), could validators unknowingly deploy nodes with compilation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Error context loss] The .context('Failed to create release') doesn't preserve detailed compilation errors - can this hide security-relevant warnings about unsafe Move code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Partial build artifacts] If the build script crashes mid-execution, can partial head.mrb files be left behind that get mistakenly loaded as valid framework code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent build race] If multiple build processes run simultaneously (e.g., in parallel CI jobs), can they conflict when writing to the same OUT_DIR causing corrupted head.mrb files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [File locking absence] There's no file locking on the output file - can concurrent builds overwrite each other's head.mrb, resulting in non-deterministic framework bytecode across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Atomic write failure] Is the head.mrb file written atomically, or can readers observe partially-written bytecode during builds, loading corrupt framework code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [aptos_framework dependency] The script imports aptos_framework::ReleaseTarget - can an attacker perform a supply chain attack by compromising this crate to inject malicious behavior into all builds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Transitive dependencies] Are the transitive dependencies of the aptos_framework crate audited for malicious code that could compromise framework compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Compiler toolchain attack] Can an attacker compromise the Rust compiler or Move compiler used by create_release() to inject backdoors at compilation time (Ken Thompson attack)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build script dependencies] Does the build script itself have dependencies that could be compromised to alter build behavior before create_release() is even called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [No checksum verification] The build script doesn't verify checksums of input source files before compilation - can an attacker modify sources without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Missing signature verification] There's no signature verification of the produced head.mrb file - can an attacker replace it with malicious bytecode that validators will trust? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Reproducible builds] Does the build process produce deterministic head.mrb files, or can build environment variations cause different validators to have different framework bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Version pinning] Are the framework package versions (move-stdlib, aptos-framework, etc.) strictly pinned, or can an attacker force builds to use vulnerable versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [aptos-experimental inclusion] The build includes aptos-experimental which may contain untested code - can vulnerabilities in experimental features be exploited in production if accidentally enabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Framework source tampering] Can an attacker with filesystem access modify the aptos-framework/sources files after the build starts but before they're read, injecting malicious Move code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Token contract manipulation] The script compiles aptos-token and aptos-token-objects - can an attacker inject malicious token handling logic that allows unauthorized minting or burning? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Stdlib backdoors] Can an attacker modify move-stdlib sources to backdoor fundamental operations like transfers or account creation that affect all contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build profile exploitation] Does the script respect cargo build profiles (debug/release), or can an attacker force debug builds in production with assertion checks disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Feature flag manipulation] Can an attacker enable dangerous feature flags during framework compilation that expose insecure code paths or debugging interfaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Optimization level bypass] Can an attacker force compilation without optimizations (-O0) that leaves vulnerable code patterns the optimizer would normally eliminate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path disclosure in logs] The println! statements display full filesystem paths - can this leak sensitive information about the build environment structure to attackers? (Low)",
