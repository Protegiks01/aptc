  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: setup_bn254_pk()] [h_query comment] The TODO comment questions why h_query length is a power of 2 - could this uncertainty indicate a misunderstanding of the Groth16 protocol that affects security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [Proof validation] Generated proofs are passed to black_box() but never validated - could invalid proofs be generated without detection in benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [Circuit cloning] The circuit is cloned on each iteration because Groth16::prove consumes it - could this cloning overhead misrepresent actual proof generation costs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [RNG reuse] A fresh thread_rng() is created for each proof - does this accurately reflect production usage patterns where RNG state might be reused? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: random_128bit_witness()] [Memory allocation] Allocating vectors with NUM_VARIABLES - 1 = 1,406,685 elements - could this cause memory exhaustion on resource-constrained systems running benchmarks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: generate_constraints()] [Vector capacity] Vec::with_capacity(self.num_variables) pre-allocates memory - could incorrect capacity estimation cause reallocations and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [Proof memory] Generated proofs are black_boxed but not explicitly dropped - could accumulated proof objects cause memory leaks in long-running benchmark sessions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: setup_bn254_pk()] [Proving key size] The proving key for 1.4M constraints is likely very large (GB-scale) - is memory consumption monitored to prevent OOM errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [Timing measurement] Benchmarks measure wall time for proof generation - could timing variations reveal information about witness values through side-channels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_bn254_circuit()] [Constant-time operations] The benchmark doesn't verify constant-time execution - could witness-dependent timing variations in the underlying ark_groth16 library be exploitable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: random_128bit_witness()] [Witness size impact] Benchmarks compare norm-1 vs 128-bit witnesses - do timing differences reveal information about witness bit-length that could aid cryptanalytic attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_group()] [Warm-up timing] The 2-second warm_up_time may be insufficient to stabilize CPU caches and branch predictors - could cold-start timing leaks be present? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_group()] [Sample size] sample_size(10) provides only 10 samples - is this sufficient for statistical significance, or could outliers skew performance estimates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_group()] [Measurement time] The 30-second measurement_time may be insufficient for accurate profiling of cryptographic operations - could this lead to incorrect performance conclusions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_group()] [Throughput metric] Throughput is measured in NUM_CONSTRAINTS elements - does this metric accurately represent real-world Keyless proof generation throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: bench_group()] [Multithreading] The benchmark name includes 'multithreaded' but doesn't explicitly configure thread count - could uncontrolled parallelism cause non-deterministic results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Struct: SizedCircuit] [Circuit semantics] The dummy circuit enforces v * 1 = v constraints - does this accurately model the constraint density and structure of the real Keyless circuit? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: generate_constraints()] [Public vs private] Only 1 variable is public (x0) out of 1,406,686 total - is this ratio representative of the actual Keyless public input requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: generate_constraints()] [Constraint complexity] All constraints use simple linear combinations - does the real Keyless circuit include more complex polynomial constraints that would change proving costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: generate_constraints()] [ConstraintSystemRef errors] Calls to cs.new_input_variable() and cs.new_witness_variable() return Result types - are all error cases properly handled or could SynthesisError propagate unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: generate_constraints()] [Assertion failure] The witness length assertion could panic - should this be a recoverable error instead of crashing the benchmark? (Low)",
