  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [TypeTag: Validation] [Malformed Types] Does the system validate that key_type and value_type are well-formed TypeTags before storing in TableInfo, or can malformed types cause VM panics during table access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Hash: TableHandle] [HashMap Poisoning] Can an attacker craft TableHandles with specific hash values to cause worst-case O(n) HashMap lookup performance, degrading validator performance below liveness thresholds? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Memory: size()] [Calculation Accuracy] Does size() at line 16-18 accurately represent the memory footprint of TableHandle, or does it underestimate heap allocations leading to OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Memory: Clone] [Deep Copy Safety] Does the derived Clone implementation perform deep copies of all fields, or can shallow copies lead to aliasing bugs when TableHandles are duplicated? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [State: Handle Creation] [Uniqueness Guarantee] Is there any validation ensuring TableHandles are globally unique across all tables, or can handle collisions occur under specific transaction patterns? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [State: Info Updates] [Mutation Safety] Can TableInfo be modified after table creation, and if so, are there safeguards preventing type changes that violate existing table data invariants? (High)",
