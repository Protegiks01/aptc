  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Enum: RpcError::TooManyPending] [Consensus starvation] When inbound consensus RPCs (block proposals, votes) are rejected with TooManyPending errors, does the protocol implement priority queuing to ensure consensus-critical messages aren't starved by lower-priority state-sync or mempool RPCs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Enum: RpcError::TooManyPending] [Fairness attack] Can a Byzantine validator monopolize another validator's RPC queue with slow-processing requests, causing TooManyPending errors for legitimate requests from honest validators, effectively censoring their participation in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Enum: RpcError::TooManyPending] [Threshold manipulation] Is the max_concurrent_rpcs threshold (stored in TooManyPending) set appropriately for all network conditions, or can network latency variations cause legitimate traffic to exceed limits, triggering false-positive rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Error propagation] [State inconsistency] When RpcError is propagated from network layer through consensus to execution, are there error boundary handlers that ensure atomic rollback of partial state changes, or can errors leave validators with divergent state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Error propagation] [Byzantine behavior] Can Byzantine validators intentionally trigger specific RpcError types (NotConnected, TimedOut) to force honest validators into error handling paths that expose timing side channels or reveal validator internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Error propagation] [Metrics manipulation] If error metrics are collected based on RpcError variants, can attackers manipulate error types to pollute monitoring systems, hiding real attacks within noise or triggering false alerts that desensitize operators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Error propagation] [Recovery deadlock] When multiple concurrent RPCs fail with different error types, can error recovery handlers deadlock if they attempt to acquire the same locks in different orders, permanently halting the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: InboundRpcs] [Request rejection] When InboundRpcs::handle_inbound_request returns TooManyPending error, does the calling code increment appropriate metrics and clean up resources, or can rejected requests accumulate causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: InboundRpcs] [Timeout handling] When inbound consensus requests timeout and yield RpcError::TimedOut, does the InboundRpcs task properly signal the application layer, or can timed-out requests leave the application waiting indefinitely for responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: InboundRpcs] [Channel cleanup] When UnexpectedResponseChannelCancel occurs in InboundRpcs completion queue, are oneshot channels properly dropped to prevent descriptor leaks, or can canceled channels accumulate over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: InboundRpcs] [Error ordering] If multiple inbound RPCs complete with errors simultaneously, can the FuturesUnordered task queue deliver errors in a non-deterministic order that violates consensus message ordering assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: OutboundRpcs] [Request cancellation] When application layer cancels outbound RPC via oneshot::Canceled → UnexpectedResponseChannelCancel, does OutboundRpcs properly remove the request from pending_outbound_rpcs HashMap, or can canceled requests leak memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: OutboundRpcs] [Response mismatching] Can InvalidRpcResponse errors be triggered by request_id collisions or wraparound, causing validators to match responses to wrong requests and corrupting consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: OutboundRpcs] [Capacity DoS] When OutboundRpcs reaches max_concurrent_outbound_rpcs and returns TooManyPending, can this permanently block critical consensus operations if the pending queue is filled with low-priority long-running requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Integration: OutboundRpcs] [Notification failure] If RpcError notification to application layer fails (oneshot send error), does the OutboundRpcs task retry or log the failure, or will the application layer hang indefinitely waiting for a response? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Consensus impact] [Vote loss] When RPC errors occur during vote collection for block proposals, can they cause validators to miss votes, preventing quorum formation even with > 2/3 honest validators online? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Consensus impact] [Block proposal failure] If RpcError::NotConnected occurs when broadcasting block proposals to validators, can this cause the proposer to fail to distribute blocks to enough validators, halting round progression? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Consensus impact] [Epoch boundary] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can RpcError::NotConnected for old validators be mishandled, causing new epoch validators to reject valid reconfiguration messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Consensus impact] [Safety violation] Can specific sequences of RpcErrors (e.g., TimedOut followed by InvalidRpcResponse) cause consensus safety rules to be violated, allowing double-voting or equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [State sync impact] [Chunk delivery] When state sync chunk RPCs fail with BcsError or InvalidRpcResponse, does the state sync protocol implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff, or can Byzantine peers force continuous retries causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [State sync impact] [Proof verification] If RPC errors occur during state proof delivery, can malicious peers selectively fail proof requests to prevent honest nodes from syncing, creating a two-tiered network of synced and unsynced validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [State sync impact] [Progress tracking] When TooManyPending errors occur during high-throughput state sync, does the sync coordinator back off appropriately, or will it continue hammering the network with requests causing cascading failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Health check impact] [False positives] Can transient RpcErrors during health checks cause legitimate peers to be incorrectly marked as unhealthy, leading to premature disconnections that reduce network connectivity below Byzantine fault tolerance thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Memory safety] [Panic on error] Does any error conversion code path (From implementations) perform operations that could panic (unwrap, expect, indexing), potentially crashing validator nodes when rare error conditions occur in production?
