  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [All From Implementations] [Error Source Loss] Do the From trait implementations lose important context about the original error source that would be needed for security incident response or forensic analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [String Formatting in From Implementations] [Stack Trace Truncation] Can extremely long error messages from source errors cause truncation in the format! macro, losing critical security context about the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::EntropyError] [Entropy Source DoS] Can attackers force repeated EntropyError conditions that prevent validator key generation or rotation, causing validators to be excluded from the active set and reducing Byzantine tolerance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyAlreadyExists] [Key Slot Exhaustion] Can attackers create numerous keys that trigger KeyAlreadyExists for legitimate validator key names, exhausting available key slots and preventing validator registration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::SerializationError] [Deserialization DoS] Can crafted inputs trigger repeated SerializationError conditions that force expensive deserialization retries, causing CPU exhaustion during critical consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [All Error Variants] [Implementation Inconsistency] Do all storage backend implementations (VaultStorage, OnDiskStorage, InMemoryStorage) handle Error variants consistently, or can differences in error handling cause validator consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From Trait Implementations] [Conversion Asymmetry] Can error conversions lose information that prevents proper error propagation back to callers, causing incorrect error classification in upper layers of the stack? (Medium)"
