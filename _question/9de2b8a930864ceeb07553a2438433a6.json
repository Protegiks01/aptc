  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: Files] [Unicode Exploitation] Does Files<String> properly handle non-UTF8 sequences or Unicode exploits (homoglyphs, RTL overrides) that could be used to craft misleading error messages hiding malicious code locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Type: Severity] [Enum Transmutation] Can unsafe code or FFI boundaries transmute invalid integer values into the Severity enum, bypassing severity checks in report_diag() and allowing arbitrary diagnostic filtering? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Type: Severity] [Comparison Overflow] Does the severity >= comparison in report_diag() properly handle all Severity variants, or can edge cases cause warnings to be treated as errors or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: error_writer()] [Box Double-Free] Can error handling paths cause Box<dyn WriteColor> to be freed twice, leading to memory corruption on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: error_emitter()] [Vtable Corruption] Can type confusion between HumanEmitter and JsonEmitter corrupt the trait object vtable, allowing attackers to hijack control flow through malicious emit() calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: error_emitter()] [Fat Pointer Manipulation] Can the fat pointer (data + vtable) for Box<dyn Emitter> be manipulated through memory corruption to point to attacker-controlled code, achieving arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Send/Sync Safety] Are Emitter trait objects marked Send/Sync correctly, or can improper thread safety assumptions cause data races when emitting diagnostics from multiple validator threads? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Drop Safety] Do HumanEmitter and JsonEmitter properly implement Drop to flush buffers, or can premature dropping cause diagnostic loss or writer corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Unwinding Safety] If emit() unwinds due to panic, can this violate invariants in the parent compilation pipeline, causing memory leaks or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: check_diag()] [Timing Side Channel] Can the time taken by check_diag() to report diagnostics leak information about the structure of compiled Move code, enabling timing attacks to infer private contract logic? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Dependency Confusion] Can attackers exploit vulnerabilities in upstream crates (codespan, codespan_reporting, serde_json) to compromise diagnostic emission and bypass compiler security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Error Recovery] After check_diag() bails with an error, is the compiler state properly cleaned up, or can residual diagnostic state from failed compilations affect subsequent compilations on the same validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: StandardStream] [Stderr Hijacking] Can malicious code redirect StandardStream::stderr() to a controlled destination, allowing attackers to suppress or capture error messages that would otherwise alert validators to security issues? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: std::io::sink] [Null Writer Exploitation] Can the std::io::sink() null writer leak partial writes before full suppression, or can it be exploited to crash the writer thread through unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: error_emitter()] [Lifetime Extension Attack] Can callers extend the lifetime 'w beyond the writer's actual lifetime through unsafe code, causing use-after-free when the returned emitter tries to write? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Trait: Emitter] [Default Method Override] If subtraits of Emitter override report_diag() or check_diag(), can they introduce vulnerabilities by skipping critical validation checks present in the default implementations? (Medium)"
