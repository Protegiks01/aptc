  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: record_node_info_response()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to record_node_info_response() from different threads cause inconsistent state where request_tracker shows success but recorded_node_info_response contains stale or partially written data due to non-atomic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: record_node_info_response()] [State inconsistency] Does the two-step process of write().record_response_success() followed by assignment to recorded_node_info_response create a window where the tracker state and actual response are inconsistent, allowing Byzantine peers to trigger incorrect monitoring decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_request_failure()] [Deadlock] Can concurrent read locks on request_tracker from get_request_tracker() combined with write locks from handle_request_failure() create deadlock scenarios that halt peer monitoring and affect validator liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Struct: NodeInfoState] [Memory leak] Does the Arc<RwLock<RequestTracker>> with clone() in get_request_tracker() create reference cycles or prevent proper cleanup when peers disconnect, potentially causing memory exhaustion over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: get_latest_node_info_response()] [TOCTOU race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where get_latest_node_info_response() returns Some(response) but the response is immediately overwritten by concurrent record_node_info_response(), causing stale data to be used for critical decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Type confusion] Can a malicious peer send a crafted PeerMonitoringServiceResponse that matches the NodeInformation variant but contains invalid or malicious NodeInformationResponse data that bypasses validation and corrupts state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Missing validation] Does the code validate that NodeInformationResponse fields (highest_synced_epoch, highest_synced_version, ledger_timestamp_usecs, lowest_available_version) are logically consistent, or can Byzantine peers inject impossible values that break monitoring logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Monotonicity violation] Can a Byzantine peer send decreasing highest_synced_version or epoch values that violate blockchain monotonicity invariants, potentially causing monitoring to incorrectly assess peer health or trigger false alarms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Version range attack] Can malicious peers provide lowest_available_version > highest_synced_version creating invalid version ranges that could crash downstream consumers or cause state sync failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can Byzantine peers inject ledger_timestamp_usecs values far in the future or past to manipulate time-based monitoring decisions or metrics, potentially affecting validator selection or peer scoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide Duration uptime values that cause node_uptime.as_secs_f64() / 3600.0 to overflow or produce NaN/Infinity when converted to hours, corrupting metrics or causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Precision loss] Does converting Duration to f64 hours lose precision for very large uptime values (>292 years in microseconds), potentially causing metrics to wrap around or become inaccurate for long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Arithmetic overflow] Can highest_synced_epoch, highest_synced_version, or ledger_timestamp_usecs be crafted to overflow u64 boundaries when used in calculations elsewhere in the monitoring system, causing incorrect peer assessments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration bypass] Can malicious node_monitoring_config values (e.g., node_info_request_interval_ms=0 or u64::MAX) bypass rate limiting or cause infinite request loops that overwhelm peers and degrade network performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: get_request_timeout_ms()] [Timeout manipulation] Can node_monitoring_config.node_info_request_timeout_ms be set to extremely low values that cause all requests to timeout, or extremely high values that block monitoring indefinitely, affecting validator operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Uninitialized state] Does starting with recorded_node_info_response=None create security issues where early monitoring decisions are made without any peer data, potentially causing incorrect validator set updates or peer bans? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Struct: NodeInfoState] [Clone safety] Does the Clone implementation for NodeInfoState properly handle the Arc<RwLock<RequestTracker>> reference counting, or can clone operations create shared mutable state that violates Rust's safety guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: get_latest_node_info_response()] [Clone overhead] Can repeated calls to get_latest_node_info_response() with clone() on NodeInformationResponse cause memory pressure or performance degradation when handling many peers, potentially affecting validator operation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: get_request_tracker()] [Reference leak] Does returning Arc<RwLock<RequestTracker>> clones allow external code to hold locks indefinitely, creating potential for deadlocks or preventing proper state updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Silent failure] When receiving unexpected response types, does only logging a warning and calling handle_request_failure() allow Byzantine peers to repeatedly send invalid responses without being banned or penalized? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response_error()] [Error disclosure] Do the warn! log messages in handle_monitoring_service_response_error() expose sensitive network topology or validator information that could aid targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_request_failure()] [Failure tracking bypass] Can an attacker cause request_tracker.record_response_failure() to be called without actual failures by sending malformed responses, artificially inflating failure counts and causing legitimate peers to be incorrectly marked as unhealthy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Metric poisoning] Can Byzantine peers send extreme uptime values (Duration::MAX or Duration::ZERO) to poison NODE_UPTIME metrics, causing incorrect peer reputation scores or validator selection decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Metric manipulation] Does the lack of bounds checking on uptime_in_hours allow attackers to inject values that skew aggregated metrics and mislead monitoring dashboards about network health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Missing metrics] Are there critical peer health indicators (e.g., version consistency, epoch alignment) that should be tracked but aren't, creating blind spots in validator monitoring?
