  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: decompile_v1()] [Revela Compatibility] Does Revela's lack of V7 support create attack vectors where V7 bytecode is silently downgraded and decompiled incorrectly? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Short Circuit] Does the is_some_and() short-circuit evaluation properly prevent evaluation of the inner closure when print_code_size is None? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: disassemble_v1()] [File System Race] Can the source file check (fs::read_to_string) be affected by TOCTOU races where files are modified between check and use? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Struct: BytecodeCommand] [Hidden Flag] Why is print_code_size marked as hide(true), and could this hidden functionality be exploited by attackers who discover it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Enum: DisassemblerVersion] [Ordering] Are the Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord implementations security-relevant, and could version comparison bugs exist? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Enum: DecompilerVersion] [Future Versions] If V3 or higher versions are added in the future, could this break security assumptions in version handling logic? (Low)",
