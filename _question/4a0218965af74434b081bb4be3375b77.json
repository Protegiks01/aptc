(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Function: populate_intrinsic_decl()] [Operation Pattern Matching] Lines 235-248 pattern match on Operation::SpecFunction - can an attacker provide a different Operation variant that still contains function IDs to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Function: populate_intrinsic_decl()] [Error Continue Exploitation] The function uses 'continue' on errors rather than returning - can an attacker trigger multiple errors to skip validation for some mappings while others succeed, leaving partial/corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Function: populate_intrinsic_decl()] [is_move_fun Boolean Trust] The is_move_fun boolean from associated_funs determines validation path - if this map is corrupted or maliciously modified, can move functions be validated as spec functions or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Function: populate_intrinsic_decl()] [Fun Table Lookup Race] Lines 178-206 lookup builder.parent.fun_table - can concurrent modifications to fun_table during intrinsic processing cause TOCTOU bugs where a function exists during check but is removed before mapping?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Struct: IntrinsicsAnnotation] [Duplicate Key Overwrite] If the same QualifiedId is inserted multiple times via add_decl(), BTreeMap insert will silently overwrite - can this be exploited to replace legitimate intrinsic mappings with malicious ones? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Function: add_decl()] [Atomic Transaction Failure] The add_decl() method performs multiple inserts without rollback - if the system crashes after partial inserts, can this leave corrupted state that causes subsequent intrinsic lookups to fail or return wrong results?
