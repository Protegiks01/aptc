  "[File: consensus/src/lib.rs] [Struct: IntGaugeGuard] [Clone/Copy] IntGaugeGuard doesn't implement Clone or Copy - can accidental moves or multiple ownership attempts cause compilation errors that might hide logic bugs in consensus code? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 20-61] [Module privacy] Private modules like block_storage, consensusdb, epoch_manager contain core consensus logic - can public re-exports from these modules (like create_checkpoint) bypass intended encapsulation and allow external manipulation of consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/lib.rs] [Line: 67] [Public checkpoint function] The create_checkpoint function is publicly exported - can this be called by non-consensus code at arbitrary times to force inconsistent checkpoint creation, potentially causing state divergence between validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 7-10] [Documentation] The file documents that AptosBFT is based on DiemBFT - can attackers exploit known vulnerabilities from DiemBFT if they weren't properly addressed in the Aptos fork? (Medium)",
