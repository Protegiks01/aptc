  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Constant: SECURE_STORAGE_FILENAME] [Filename Collision] Can multiple validators on the same host using the default filename 'secure_storage.json' at line 15 accidentally share or overwrite each other's keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::set_data_dir()] [Unvalidated Input] Does set_data_dir() at line 149 validate that the new data_dir exists, is a directory, has proper permissions, and is not a symlink before updating? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::namespace()] [Option Unwrapping] Does the as_deref() at line 30 handle all edge cases correctly, or could empty namespaces be treated differently from None namespaces, causing isolation bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::clear_namespace()] [Pattern Matching] Does the match statement at lines 37-42 handle all SecureBackend variants, or could new variants be added without updating this function, causing unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::is_in_memory()] [Misuse Detection] When is_in_memory() returns true, are callers properly checking this before performing operations that require persistence, or could validators lose keys by using InMemoryStorage in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [InMemoryStorage Production Use] At line 166, when creating InMemoryStorage, are there any runtime checks or warnings to prevent accidental use in production, where validator keys would be lost on restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: SecureBackend] [Concurrent Access] Is SecureBackend thread-safe when shared across threads, or can concurrent calls to namespace() and clear_namespace() create data races on the Option<String> fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::set_data_dir()] [Thread Safety] Can concurrent calls to set_data_dir() and path() from different threads cause undefined behavior or expose partially updated state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Server URL Validation] Is the 'server' field validated to be a proper URL format, or can malformed URLs cause crashes or unexpected behavior in VaultStorage initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Empty Server] Can an empty server string be provided in VaultConfig, potentially causing validators to connect to unexpected default Vault instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: OnDiskStorageConfig] [Path Validation] Are there any restrictions on characters allowed in the path field, or can special characters (NUL, newlines) cause filesystem API issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Namespace Validation] Are namespace strings validated to prevent injection of Vault path separators or other special characters that could break Vault key isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Backend Mismatch] Can configuration changes cause a validator to switch from Vault to OnDisk backend, potentially using stale or incorrect keys if the backends aren't synchronized? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Namespace Inconsistency] When converting SecureBackend to Storage, can inconsistencies between the backend's namespace and the wrapped Namespaced storage cause key lookups to fail or return wrong keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Storage Reuse] Is the Storage instance created safely, or can multiple conversions from the same SecureBackend config cause shared state issues in the underlying storage implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: VaultConfig::ca_certificate()] [Certificate Validation] After reading the CA certificate file, is the certificate content validated (e.g., proper PEM format, valid dates), or can invalid certificates cause validator crashes or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: VaultConfig::ca_certificate()] [Certificate Chain] Does ca_certificate() support certificate chains, or does it only read a single certificate, potentially breaking trust chain validation for Vault connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Certificate Updates] If the CA certificate file is updated while a validator is running, will the updated certificate be used, or will stale certificates continue to be used, potentially causing trust issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Infinite File Read] Can symbolic links that point to special files like /dev/random or /dev/zero cause read_to_string() to hang indefinitely, denying service to validator startup? (High)",
