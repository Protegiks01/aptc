  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Deserialization] When parsing the TOML file at MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH, is there proper validation to prevent deserialization attacks where malicious TOML content exploits vulnerabilities in the TOML parser library? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Timeout Handling] When making requests to MOVEY_URL, does the client code implement proper timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion if the movey.net server becomes unresponsive or is under attack? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Retry Logic] If requests to MOVEY_URL fail, does the retry logic properly implement exponential backoff, or could an attacker trigger aggressive retries that cause accidental denial of service against movey.net? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constants: MOVEY_URL + MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [State Consistency] If the credential file at '/movey_credential.toml' contains credentials for the production URL but the debug build points to staging, can this mismatch cause authentication failures or credential leakage across environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Header Injection] When constructing HTTP requests to MOVEY_URL, does the client code properly sanitize any user input that might be included in headers, preventing header injection attacks against the movey.net API? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Service Dependency] Since MOVEY_URL is hardcoded, if the movey.net service becomes unavailable or malicious, does the Move CLI have a fallback mechanism, or will critical functionality fail causing denial of service for Move developers? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Heroku Security] The staging URL 'movey-app-staging.herokuapp.com' (line 5) is hosted on Heroku. Can vulnerabilities in Heroku's platform or misconfigurations in the Heroku app expose debug builds to security risks not present in the production movey.net deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [TLS Version] Do requests to MOVEY_URL enforce modern TLS versions (TLS 1.2+), or can an attacker force downgrade to vulnerable versions like SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0 with known cryptographic weaknesses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Container Security] In containerized deployments (Docker/Kubernetes), does the absolute path '/movey_credential.toml' (line 8) properly resolve to a secure volume, or could it expose credentials through container misconfiguration? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Credential Rotation] Is there a mechanism to rotate credentials stored at '/movey_credential.toml', or do old credentials persist indefinitely creating a growing attack surface if the file is ever compromised? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [API Versioning] Does MOVEY_URL include version information, or could breaking API changes on movey.net cause the Move CLI to malfunction or misinterpret responses in security-critical ways? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Audit Logging] Are accesses to the credential file at '/movey_credential.toml' (line 8) properly logged for security auditing, or can an attacker access credentials without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Rate Limiting] Does the movey.net API implement rate limiting for requests from the Move CLI using MOVEY_URL, or could a compromised client be used to perform abuse against the Movey service? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constants: All] [Memory Safety] Since Rust enforces memory safety, are these string constants properly protected against buffer overflows, or could unsafe code blocks in consuming modules corrupt these values causing security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [File Existence] Does code using MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH handle the case where '/movey_credential.toml' doesn't exist securely, or could an attacker exploit error handling to cause information disclosure or denial of service? (Low)"
