  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: get_public_delta()] [Reference safety] Does returning a reference to Delta from get_public_delta() create lifetime issues or allow mutation of the underlying AugmentedPubKeyShare? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [Error detail leakage] Do error messages from anyhow::Result leak cryptographic details that could aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Partial verification] Can verify_share() pass with only partial verification checks, allowing subtly invalid ProofShares to be aggregated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: derive_eval()] [Silent failures] Can derive_eval() return Ok with an incorrect Evaluation instead of Err when internal checks fail, causing silent consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_proof()] [Exception handling] Are all cryptographic exceptions (invalid points, field arithmetic errors) properly caught and converted to errors, or can uncaught exceptions crash validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Trait: WeightedVUF] [Cross-message replay] Can a ProofShare or Proof created for message M1 be replayed for a different message M2, bypassing message-specific validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Trait: WeightedVUF] [Cross-epoch replay] Can shares or proofs from previous epochs be replayed in new epochs after validator set changes, causing stale randomness to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Trait: WeightedVUF] [Freshness validation] Is there any freshness or nonce mechanism to prevent replay of old valid proofs in new contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Type: Evaluation] [Deserialization validation] When deserializing Evaluations received over the network, is there validation that deserialized values are well-formed and in valid ranges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Type: Evaluation] [Canonical encoding] Does Serialize produce canonical encodings, or can multiple different byte representations deserialize to the same Evaluation causing consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Zero weight handling] What happens when a Player in WeightedConfigBlstrs has zero weight - is their share ignored or does it cause division by zero or other arithmetic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Negative weight exploit] Can negative or invalid weight values in WeightedConfigBlstrs be exploited to manipulate quorum calculations or proof aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: derive_eval()] [Weight-APK mismatch] If WeightedConfigBlstrs assigns weights to players differently than the apks vector ordering, can this mismatch cause incorrect evaluation derivation? (High)"
