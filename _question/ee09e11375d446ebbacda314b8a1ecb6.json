(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Session ID Manipulation] Does SessionId::run_on_abort properly validate txn_meta parameters, or can an attacker provide crafted TransactionMetadata with manipulated sender/sequence_number/script_hash to create colliding session IDs that confuse the VM's session tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger abort hook creation repeatedly with extremely large prologue_session_change_set.unpack() data, causing memory exhaustion during RespawnedSession::spawn() and potentially crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Type Confusion] When prologue_session_change_set.unpack() passes VMChangeSet to RespawnedSession, can malformed change sets with inconsistent resource types cause type confusion in the Move VM, leading to memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Context Injection] Does txn_meta.as_user_transaction_context() properly sanitize transaction metadata, or can an attacker inject malicious context data that gets passed to the spawned session and affects abort hook execution behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Null Pointer] If resolver is a null or invalid AptosMoveResolver reference, does RespawnedSession::spawn() properly handle this, or can it cause null pointer dereference leading to validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas Bypass] Does the abort hook session creation consume gas, or can an attacker repeatedly trigger transaction aborts to create unlimited abort hook sessions without gas charges, enabling DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [State Race Condition] Can concurrent abort hook session creations for different transactions operating on the same accounts create race conditions in RespawnedSession::spawn(), leading to inconsistent state views across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: new()] [Lifetime Violation] The session has lifetime 'r tied to resolver - can an attacker cause the resolver to be dropped while the AbortHookSession is still active, creating use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: finish()] [Change Set Squashing Attack] When session.finish_with_squashed_change_set() merges the abort hook changes with prologue changes, can an attacker craft conflicting write operations (create-after-create, modify-after-delete) that either bypass validation or cause invariant violations leading to state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: finish()] [Resource Creation Bypass] The finish_with_squashed_change_set is called with assert_no_additional_creation=false - can an attacker exploit this to create new storage slots during abort handling that wouldn't be allowed in normal execution, potentially enabling storage refund exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: finish()] [Double Spend via Squashing] When squashing change sets, can an attacker create a prologue_session_change_set that deletes a resource and then recreate it in the abort hook, allowing them to claim storage refunds multiple times for the same slot?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: finish()] [SystemSessionChangeSet::new Bypass] Can an attacker craft a change_set that passes finish_with_squashed_change_set validation but fails SystemSessionChangeSet::new() validation, creating an inconsistent state where some changes are applied but others rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Function: finish()] [Module Storage Manipulation] The finish() function takes module_storage parameter - can an attacker provide a malicious module storage implementation that returns incorrect module bytecode during change set finalization, enabling bytecode injection?

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/user_transaction_sessions/abort_hook.rs] [Integration: finish_aborted_transaction] [Gas Metering Bypass] The abort hook session creation and execution happens after transaction abort - can an attacker trigger expensive operations in the abort hook without sufficient gas checks, as gas validation occurs after abort_hook_session.finish()? (High)",
