  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Memory Safety] [VecDeque Capacity] VecDeque.with_capacity(1) starts small. Can worst-case reallocation patterns cause O(n²) behavior when growing from 1 to max_queue_size through repeated reallocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Integration] [Consensus Messages] If this queue is used for consensus messages (proposals, votes, timeouts), can message dropping or reordering cause safety violations in AptosBFT? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Integration] [Validator Keys] If keys represent validator addresses, can a Byzantine validator send excessive messages under multiple fake peer IDs to circumvent per-key rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Integration] [Transaction Propagation] If used for transaction mempool propagation, can message dropping cause transactions to never reach validators, effectively censoring specific transaction types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Integration] [State Sync] If used for state synchronization messages, can FIFO dropping of newest messages prevent validators from ever catching up to current state during sync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Resource Exhaustion] [Key Flooding] Can an attacker connect as thousands of ephemeral peers, each sending one message, to create thousands of HashMap entries that consume memory despite GC running every 50 pops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Resource Exhaustion] [Queue Filling] Can an attacker identify a legitimate validator's key and continuously send messages to keep their queue at max_queue_size, preventing any new legitimate messages from that validator from being enqueued? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Resource Exhaustion] [CPU Exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger worst-case HashMap operations by choosing keys with hash collisions, degrading pop() and push() performance to O(n) and causing consensus timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Message Manipulation] [Selective Dropping] Can an attacker exploit the bounded queue to selectively drop specific message types (e.g., always drop votes, keep proposals) by controlling message send timing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Message Manipulation] [Reordering Attack] In KLAST mode, can an attacker exploit the drop-oldest-retrieve-FIFO semantics to cause messages to be reordered in ways that violate consensus message causality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Message Manipulation] [Priority Inversion] By filling queues for high-priority validators, can an attacker cause round-robin to spend more time processing low-priority messages, effectively inverting message priorities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Fairness] [Round-Robin Bypass] Can an attacker send messages to multiple keys they control, getting multiple positions in round_robin_queue and receiving more than fair share of processing time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Fairness] [Starvation] Can an attacker keep their keys at the front of round_robin_queue by sending exactly one message per pop cycle, ensuring other validators' messages are never processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Attack: Fairness] [Amplification] If one validator sends many small messages and another sends few large messages, can the round-robin algorithm unfairly favor the small-message sender? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case] [Single Key] When only one key exists in the system, can round-robin degrade to sequential processing with no fairness guarantees, allowing that single key to monopolize processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Messages] When all queues are empty, can repeated pop() calls cause performance issues or trigger unexpected code paths in error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Queue Size = 1] With NonZeroUsize::new(1), each key can hold only 1 message. Can this cause excessive message dropping even under normal load, effectively rate-limiting legitimate traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case] [Huge Max Queue Size] If max_queue_size is set to usize::MAX, can memory exhaustion occur before per-key bounds provide any protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case] [Key Reuse] If a key is removed from round_robin_queue due to empty queue, then new messages arrive for that key, is the key correctly re-added to round_robin_queue or does it remain orphaned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case: GC] [GC Threshold] With POPS_PER_GC=50, can this constant be too high for high-churn scenarios (e.g., public fullnode serving millions of clients), allowing memory leak between GC cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case: GC] [GC Threshold] With POPS_PER_GC=50, can this constant be too low for low-churn scenarios (e.g., stable validator set), causing unnecessary GC overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case: GC] [No GC After Clear] After clear() is called, num_popped_since_gc retains its value. Can this cause GC to run immediately after clear() or never run if clear() is called periodically? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Edge Case: GC] [GC Only On Pop] GC only runs after successful pops. If push() is called millions of times without any pop(), can empty queues accumulate indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Metrics] [Counter Overflow] IntCounterVec counters can theoretically overflow after 2^64 operations. In a high-throughput validator processing billions of messages per day, can counter overflow cause metrics to wrap and become meaningless? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/channel/src/message_queues.rs] [Metrics] [Optional Counters] Counters are Option<&'static IntCounterVec>. Can None counters hide critical issues by not recording drops, making attacks invisible to monitoring? (Medium)"
