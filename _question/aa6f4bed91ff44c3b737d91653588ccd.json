  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing event coverage] Are there critical security events in consensus (e.g., double-signing, invalid quorum certificates, epoch boundary attacks) that are not represented in the SecurityEvent enum, allowing Byzantine validators to perform attacks without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing event coverage] Does the SecurityEvent enum lack variants for critical mempool attacks such as transaction replay attempts, gas price manipulation, or sequence number conflicts that could enable DoS or economic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing event coverage] Are state-sync attacks beyond invalid chunks (e.g., state fork attempts, Merkle proof manipulation, snapshot poisoning) missing from SecurityEvent variants, allowing state corruption without logging? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing event coverage] Does the SecurityEvent enum omit critical storage layer attacks (e.g., Jellyfish Merkle tree manipulation, state pruning exploits, ledger DB corruption) that could compromise state integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing event coverage] Are execution layer security events (e.g., Move VM exploits, gas metering bypass, parallel execution conflicts, resource safety violations) missing from the enum, preventing detection of VM-level attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::ConsensusInvalidMessage] [Insufficient granularity] Does the ConsensusInvalidMessage variant lack distinction between different attack types (malformed vs signature failure vs vote data corruption), making it impossible to identify specific consensus attack patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::ConsensusEquivocatingVote] [Missing context] Does ConsensusEquivocatingVote logging fail to capture the round number, validator identity, and conflicting vote details needed to prove Byzantine behavior for slashing purposes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::ConsensusEquivocatingOrderVote] [Ambiguous distinction] Is the distinction between ConsensusEquivocatingVote and ConsensusEquivocatingOrderVote unclear, potentially causing misclassification of equivocation attacks and incorrect slashing decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidConsensusProposal] [Insufficient detail] Does InvalidConsensusProposal lack specificity about WHY the proposal is invalid (bad parent, invalid timestamp, malicious payload, incorrect leader), preventing accurate threat assessment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidConsensusRound] [Missing attack vectors] Does InvalidConsensusRound fail to distinguish between accidental clock skew and intentional round manipulation attacks, allowing attackers to blend in with legitimate clock issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidSyncInfoMsg] [Limited scope] Does InvalidSyncInfoMsg miss critical sync info attacks like quorum certificate forgery, highest certified round manipulation, or epoch boundary exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidRetrievedBlock] [Ambiguous context] Is there confusion between InvalidRetrievedBlock (retrieval phase) and InvalidBlock (execution phase), potentially masking state-sync vs consensus attacks differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidTransactionMempool] [Missing transaction attack types] Does InvalidTransactionMempool fail to distinguish between signature failures, sequence number attacks, gas manipulation, and other transaction-level exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidNetworkEventMempool] [Vague categorization] Is InvalidNetworkEventMempool too broad, failing to identify specific network-layer attacks on mempool like message flooding, peer reputation attacks, or transaction censorship attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidNetworkEvent] [Insufficient granularity] Does InvalidNetworkEvent lack categorization of network attack types (peer spoofing, message replay, protocol violations, connection hijacking), preventing targeted security response? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::NoiseHandshake] [Missing handshake attack details] Does NoiseHandshake event fail to capture whether the failure was due to key exchange attacks, replay attempts, or implementation bugs, critical for distinguishing attacks from bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidNetworkEventHC] [Limited health check coverage] Does InvalidNetworkEventHC miss critical health checker attacks like false liveness signals, validator reputation manipulation, or network partition concealment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent::InvalidHealthCheckerMsg] [Insufficient detail] Does InvalidHealthCheckerMsg lack specificity about message content, allowing attackers to probe health check logic without proper detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Impl: Schema for SecurityEvent] [Serialization vulnerability] Could the visit() implementation using Value::from_serde() introduce deserialization vulnerabilities if log data is later parsed from untrusted sources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Impl: Schema for SecurityEvent] [Information leakage] Does the Schema implementation expose sensitive security event details (validator identities, internal state) that could help attackers understand detection mechanisms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Format stability] Are the serialization formats for SecurityEvent guaranteed to be stable across versions, or could format changes break security monitoring tools relying on historical logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Non-exhaustive pattern] Is the SecurityEvent enum marked as #[non_exhaustive], ensuring that future additions of critical security events don't break existing pattern matching in security analysis code? (Low)",
