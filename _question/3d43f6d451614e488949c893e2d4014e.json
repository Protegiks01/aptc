  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/tags.rs] [Type: ValidatedPublicKeyTag] [Storage round-trip] When public keys are stored in AptosDB and later retrieved, is ValidatedPublicKeyTag status preserved across the storage round-trip, or must keys be re-validated after database reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/tags.rs] [Type: ValidatedPublicKeyTag] [BCS encoding] Does the Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) format used by Aptos preserve type-level ValidatedPublicKeyTag information, or is this purely compile-time metadata that gets erased? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/tags.rs] [Module: tags] [Developer education] Are developers clearly warned that ValidatedPublicKeyTag is MIRAI-only and may not provide runtime protection, potentially leading to false security assumptions in code reviews? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/tags.rs] [Type: ValidatedPublicKeyTag] [API contract] Is it clearly documented which crypto functions require ValidatedPublicKeyTag-marked inputs vs which accept raw public keys, or can API misuse lead to unvalidated keys being used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/tags.rs] [Const: VALIDATED_PUBLIC_KEY_TAG_MASK] [Propagation policy] Is the deliberate choice of an empty propagation set documented with security rationale, so future maintainers don't accidentally change it and weaken validation requirements? (Low)"
