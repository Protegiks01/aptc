  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a malformed or malicious AccountAddress through the --account parameter that bypasses load_account_arg parsing, leading to incorrect account lookups or server-side errors that expose internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Address Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the AccountAddress parsing (line 46) by providing specially crafted hex strings that are valid addresses but point to system accounts (0x0, 0x1) to extract privileged account balances or state information not intended for public access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Type Confusion] If load_account_arg accepts multiple formats (hex, decimal, short form), can an attacker craft ambiguous inputs that parse differently between CLI and backend, causing the client to query one account while displaying balance info for another account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Address Collision] Can an attacker exploit potential hash collisions or shortened address formats in load_account_arg to query balances for an account they control while the CLI displays it as belonging to a different legitimate account address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Case Sensitivity] Does the AccountAddress parsing handle case sensitivity correctly? Can an attacker provide addresses with mixed case (0xAbCdEf vs 0xabcdef) that might bypass security checks or cause inconsistent lookups between CLI validation and backend processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Sub-account Type Confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the stake_amount flag (line 55) in combination with malicious account addresses to query stake balances for accounts that shouldn't have stake sub-accounts, potentially extracting validator staking information or causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Account Type Bypass] In the conditional logic (lines 55-59), can an attacker exploit race conditions or state changes where stake_amount=true queries return base account balances due to server-side timing, leading to incorrect balance displays that could facilitate social engineering attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Sub-account Escalation] Can an attacker exploit AccountIdentifier::total_stake_account() (line 56) to access other stake sub-account types (active_stake, pending_active_stake, operator_stake) by manipulating the account identifier construction, bypassing intended access restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Operator Stake Leak] Does the total_stake_account identifier (line 56) correctly aggregate all stake types? Can an attacker query total stake to infer operator addresses or delegation pool information that should be private, extracting validator network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Base Account Manipulation] When creating base_account (line 58), can an attacker exploit the AccountIdentifier construction to inject malicious sub_account fields through side channels, causing the backend to process stake queries when base queries were intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can an attacker manipulate the NetworkArgs (line 36) to provide an incorrect chain_id that matches a testnet/devnet identifier while querying mainnet endpoints, causing balance queries to return incorrect or stale data from wrong networks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Network Mismatch] Does the network_identifier() call (line 64) validate that the provided chain_id matches the actual network of the rosetta_api_url? Can attackers query testnet balances but claim they're from mainnet to facilitate fund theft through social engineering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Cross-chain Confusion] Can an attacker exploit network_identifier validation by providing edge case chain IDs (0, MAX_U8, negative values) that bypass validation but cause the backend to query unintended networks or crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Network Replay] Can an attacker capture a valid AccountBalanceRequest from one network and replay it on another network with the same account address to extract cross-chain balance information or detect account existence across networks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [URL Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the rosetta_api_url parameter (line 38) to inject malicious URLs with special characters, path traversal sequences (../, %2e%2e%2f), or authority components that redirect API calls to attacker-controlled servers capturing account queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [SSRF Attack] Does the client() call (line 61) validate the URL scheme and host? Can attackers provide file://, gopher://, or internal network URLs (http://localhost:6060, http://169.254.169.254) to trigger SSRF attacks against internal services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Port Scanning] Can an attacker use the rosetta_api_url parameter to systematically probe internal network ports by providing URLs like http://internal-host:PORT, using response timing or error messages to map internal infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [DNS Rebinding] Is the URL resolved only once or can DNS rebinding attacks cause the client to initially connect to a legitimate server for validation but then resolve to an attacker's server for the actual API call? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [HTTPS Downgrade] Does the default URL 'http://localhost:8082' (line 50) properly handle HTTPS?
