  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: disk_space_pricing()] [Pricing Inconsistency] Can disk_space_pricing() return different pricing strategies across validators due to configuration differences, causing consensus divergence in storage fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: balance()] [Rounding Exploitation] The function uses to_unit_round_down_with_params() at line 238. Can attackers exploit rounding down to execute many small operations where each rounds to zero gas, effectively getting free execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: gas_unit_scaling_factor()] [Zero Scaling Factor] What happens if scaling_factor() returns zero? Can this cause division by zero errors in gas calculations throughout the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: execution_gas_used()] [Rounding Direction] The function uses to_unit_round_up_with_params() at line 250. Can inconsistent rounding between charging (round down) and reporting (round up) create gas accounting discrepancies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: execution_gas_used()] [Maximum Value Handling] Can execution_gas_used() return values that exceed maximum Gas type limits, causing overflow in downstream calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: io_gas_used()] [Independent Tracking] Are execution_gas_used() and io_gas_used() tracked independently with proper isolation, or can manipulation of one affect the other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: io_gas_used()] [Conversion Consistency] Does io_gas_used() use the same rounding strategy as execution_gas_used(), or can rounding differences cause total gas to be inconsistent with charged amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: storage_fee_used()] [Fee vs Gas Mismatch] Can storage_fee_used() return Fee values that don't match the gas-unit-converted values from storage_fee_used_in_gas_units(), causing accounting inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: storage_fee_used()] [Currency Unit Confusion] Does the function properly distinguish between Fee (measured in Octa) and Gas units, or can type confusion allow incorrect fee calculations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: inject_balance()] [Type Coercion Attack] The function accepts Into<Gas> which allows implicit conversions. Can attackers exploit unexpected type conversions to inject negative or malformed balance values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: inject_balance()] [Error Handling] The function maps errors through finish(Location::Undefined) at line 270. Can this error mapping hide the true source of balance injection failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: charge_read_ref_cached()] [Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker provide incorrect cached sizes (stack_size, heap_size) that underestimate actual value sizes, causing under-charging for expensive read operations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Function: charge_read_ref_cached()] [Cache Inconsistency] If cached sizes don't match actual value sizes, can this cause non-deterministic gas charges across validators leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
