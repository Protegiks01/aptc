  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: from_recorder()] [Construction Control] Is from_recorder() restricted to internal crate use with pub(crate), or can external code create arbitrary traces, bypassing recorder validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Field Visibility] Are Trace fields private to prevent direct mutation, or can external code modify ticks, fingerprint, branch_outcomes, or calls after construction? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: TraceCursor] [Mutable Access] Does TraceCursor provide only immutable access to underlying Trace, or can replay logic mutate trace data during consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: consume_instruction_unchecked()] [Safety Contract] Is consume_instruction_unchecked() documented with safety invariants that callers must uphold, or can it be misused by calling code without understanding consequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Enum: DynamicCall] [Variant Construction] Can external code construct DynamicCall::Entrypoint or DynamicCall::Closure variants with arbitrary LoadedFunction objects, bypassing normal function loading/verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: to_string_for_tests()] [Information Disclosure] Does to_string_for_tests() expose sensitive information about function names, type arguments, or execution paths that could aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: to_string_for_tests()] [Debug Build Behavior] Is to_string_for_tests() compiled out in release builds, or could debug-only code paths be triggered in production causing unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: to_string_for_tests()] [Format String Attack] Does the string formatting in to_string_for_tests() properly escape special characters in function names, or can crafted names inject control characters? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: to_string_for_tests()] [Panic Safety] Can to_string_for_tests() panic on malformed traces with inconsistent data, and does this affect debugging of production issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Attribute: cfg(test)] [Test-Only Code] Are there test-only code paths that could be enabled in production via feature flags, exposing attack surface not intended for live deployment? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: TraceCursor] [State Transitions] Can TraceCursor be moved between invalid states by calling consume functions in wrong order (e.g., consume_branch after instructions exhausted), breaking replay correctness? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: no_instructions_remaining()] [State Check] Is no_instructions_remaining() used consistently as a precondition check, or can callers skip this check and continue consuming with instructions_remaining==0? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: is_done()] [Terminal State] After is_done() returns true, are there guards preventing further cursor consumption, or can replay continue modifying cursor state after completion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: TraceCursor] [Reuse After Done] Can a TraceCursor be reused after is_done() returns true, potentially replaying same trace multiple times with stale cursor state? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization State] Does TraceCursor::new() properly initialize all cursor fields to zero, or can uninitialized memory cause cursors to start at arbitrary positions? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Enum: DynamicCall] [Closure vs Entrypoint] Can an attacker exploit semantic differences between closure and entrypoint execution by recording one type but replaying as the other through type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: consume_closure_call()] [ClosureMask Semantics] Does ClosureMask properly restrict closure capabilities during replay, or can attacker manipulate mask values to grant unauthorized permissions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Call Order] Are calls vector entries consumed in strict FIFO order, or can replay logic skip or reorder dynamic calls, executing functions in wrong sequence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: consume_entrypoint()] [Multiple Entrypoints] Can traces contain multiple entrypoints, and if so, does replay logic handle this correctly or could it cause confusion about which entrypoint should execute? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Enum: DynamicCall] [LoadedFunction Validity] Are LoadedFunction objects in DynamicCall guaranteed to be valid and verified, or can stale/unloaded functions persist in traces causing execution of invalid code? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Semantic Consistency] If a trace has ticks=0 but non-empty branch_outcomes, is this considered valid, and could such inconsistent traces cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: is_done()] [Multi-Validator Consistency] Do all validators compute identical fingerprints for the same execution, or can platform differences (endianness, pointer size) cause validators to disagree on is_done() result? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Cross-Version Compatibility] Can traces recorded on one version of the Move VM be replayed on another version with different instruction encoding, causing fingerprint mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: num_recorded_calls()] [Count Integrity] Is there validation that recorded call count matches actual calls executed, or can mismatch between metadata and actual calls go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: TraceCursor] [Invariant Checking] Are cursor invariants (cursors <= vector lengths, instructions_remaining <= ticks) checked after each operation, or can invalid states persist? (Medium)"
