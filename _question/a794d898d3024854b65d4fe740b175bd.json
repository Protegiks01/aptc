  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/paths.rs] [Performance: Allocation Storm] [Memory Churn] Could repeated append/factor operations on large paths cause excessive allocations that degrade validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/paths.rs] [Consensus: Non-Determinism] [Verification Divergence] Could non-deterministic behavior in path operations (e.g., from hash map iteration in Lbl) cause validators to disagree on verification results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/paths.rs] [Consensus: Floating Point] [Non-Deterministic Arithmetic] If Lbl contains floating-point types, could platform-specific FP behavior cause verification divergence across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/paths.rs] [Consensus: Memory Layout] [Platform Differences] Could differences in memory layout or padding of Lbl across architectures cause leq() to produce different results? (Medium)"
