  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Public Key Length Attack] Can extremely long public key strings (>1MB) cause buffer overflow or excessive memory allocation in from_encoded_string() before validation occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Public Key Collision] Is there validation to prevent duplicate public keys across multiple entries, potentially allowing Sybil attacks where one attacker controls multiple registered node identities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Key Material Leakage] Could error messages from public key parsing leak partial key material or validation state that helps attackers craft valid-looking but malicious keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Port Number Zero] Can api_port, noise_port, or metrics_port be set to 0, which is typically invalid for binding but might bypass validation, causing failures when the node checker attempts connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Privileged Port Registration] Can attackers register nodes with privileged ports (<1024) like port 22 (SSH) or 80 (HTTP), potentially causing the node checker to connect to unintended services on validator infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Port Collision Attack] Is there validation to prevent multiple entries from using the same port numbers on the same URL/host, which could cause connection conflicts or race conditions in node checking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Maximum Port Value] Since ports are u16, are there checks for the maximum valid port (65535), or can edge case values like u16::MAX cause issues in network stack or downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Port Type Confusion] Could JSON deserialization accept negative numbers or values >65535 for port fields, and how does serde handle these before they're converted to u16 - silent truncation or error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [HashMap Memory DoS] Can an attacker provide a JSON file with entries for thousands of unique account addresses, causing unbounded growth of the node_infos and invalid_node_address_results HashMaps and exhausting memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Hash Collision DoS] Could carefully crafted account addresses that hash to the same value cause HashMap performance degradation (O(n) instead of O(1)), enabling algorithmic complexity attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Vector Growth Attack] Can attackers cause Vec::new() and repeated push() operations to trigger excessive memory reallocations by providing many entries for a single account address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Entry Ordering Dependency] Does the order of entries in the JSON file affect the final state, and can attackers exploit this to override earlier valid entries with later invalid ones or vice versa? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [HashMap Key Replacement] If the same account_address appears multiple times in the JSON, does the HashMap properly accumulate all entries in the vector, or could there be unexpected replacement behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Information Disclosure] Do error messages from context() calls like 'Failed to open input file' or 'Failed to parse input file' leak sensitive filesystem paths or JSON structure details that help attackers craft exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error Propagation] When try_into() fails and error is captured with format!('{:#}', e), does this expose internal implementation details or stack traces that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Panic on Error] Are all error paths properly handled, or could certain malformed inputs cause unwrap() or expect() panics in dependencies that crash the node checker service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error Recovery] If parsing fails midway through a large JSON file, does the function properly clean up partial state, or could this leave inconsistent data in the HashMaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Error Message Content] Does the IncompleteNetworkAddress message created with format!('{:#}', e) potentially include sensitive data like private keys or internal addresses from the failed entry? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Partial Conversion] If Url::parse() succeeds but from_encoded_string() fails, is the partially constructed NodeInfo properly cleaned up, or could partial data leak into the error result? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Type Safety Violation] Could the TryInto implementation be bypassed through unsafe code elsewhere, allowing creation of NodeInfo with invalid internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Option Handling] Does setting api_port to Some() and public_key to Some() properly validate that these are actually provided, or could None values get through due to Option semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Field Validation Order] Does the order of validation (URL first, then public key) matter, and could attackers exploit this by providing valid URL with invalid key to probe for URL validation bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Async Safety] Since get_node_infos() is async, are there any race conditions if multiple concurrent calls read the same input_file simultaneously, causing file lock contention or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Shared Mutable State] Could concurrent modifications to the input_file while get_node_infos() is reading it cause inconsistent reads or parse errors that expose internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Async Cancellation] If the async function is cancelled/dropped mid-execution, are there any resource leaks (file handles, memory allocations) that could accumulate over time? (Low)"
