  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: parse_required_option()] [None Bypass] If the option is None, does the error at lines 590-594 properly halt execution, or can subsequent code continue with uninitialized fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: parse_required_option()] [Parse Error Masking] Can generic parse() failures mask critical security issues (e.g., integer overflow in stake_amount parsing) by only showing generic error messages? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: parse_optional_option()] [Error Mapping Loss] Does the error mapping at lines 606-612 lose important context from the original parse error, making it harder to diagnose security-relevant parsing failures? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: validate_validators()] [Min Stake Bypass] Can stake_amount < layout.min_stake check at line 701 be bypassed by setting stake_amount to exactly min_stake-1, then exploiting off-by-one errors in staking logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: validate_validators()] [Max Stake Bypass] Can stake_amount > layout.max_stake check at line 707 be bypassed by splitting stake across colluding validators, exceeding intended maximum stake per entity? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/mod.rs] [Function: validate_validators()] [Error Collection Bypass] Can critical errors be lost if the errors vector at line 633 overflows or if certain error push operations fail silently? (Medium)",
