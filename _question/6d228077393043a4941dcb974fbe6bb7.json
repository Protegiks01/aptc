  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Input Validation] The score field is defined as u8 but the documentation states it should be 'score out of 100' - can an attacker pass scores > 100 (e.g., 255) to manipulate health check results and cause validators to be incorrectly rated as healthy or unhealthy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] The CheckResult::new() constructor accepts any u8 value for score without validating it's within 0-100 range - can malicious checker implementations supply invalid scores (101-255) to skew node health assessments and affect validator selection or monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Type Safety] Using u8 for score allows values 0-255 but semantically only 0-100 are valid - does this type mismatch create vulnerabilities where arithmetic operations on scores produce unexpected results outside the valid range? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Integer Overflow] In the score aggregation at line 59, scores are cast from u8 to u32 and summed - can an attacker provide a very large number of CheckResults (e.g., millions) causing the sum to overflow u32::MAX (4,294,967,295) and wrap around to produce an artificially low summary_score? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Integer Truncation] The summary_score calculation divides sum (u32) by len (u32) then casts back to u8 - can this truncation lose precision for scores that should be > 255, or can manipulation of the number of results cause the final score to be capped at 255 when it should fail validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Division Precision Loss] The aggregation uses integer division (/) which truncates decimal results - can an attacker craft CheckResults with specific scores to exploit rounding (e.g., 99 results with score 50, 1 result with score 51 gives average 50.01 truncated to 50) to systematically bias health scores downward? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Arithmetic Edge Case] If check_results contains exactly 1 result with score 0, summary_score becomes 0/1 = 0, but if it contains 0 results, summary_score is hardcoded to 100 - can an attacker exploit this discontinuity by providing minimal failing checks to produce better scores than providing no checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Logic Error] Empty check_results Vec yields summary_score of 100 (perfect score) - can an attacker or buggy checker implementation return empty results to appear perfectly healthy when no checks were actually performed, bypassing all health validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Business Logic Flaw] The special case for empty results (score = 100) contradicts the principle that absence of evidence is not evidence of health - could this allow nodes to claim perfect health by simply not running any checks, undermining the entire monitoring system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Injection Attack] The checker_name, headline, and explanation fields are unconstrained Strings with no length limits or content validation - can an attacker inject extremely large strings (gigabytes) to cause memory exhaustion when these are serialized via poem_openapi or logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [XSS Vulnerability] If explanation or headline strings are rendered in a web interface without sanitization, can an attacker inject malicious HTML/JavaScript through checker implementations to perform XSS attacks on monitoring dashboards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Log Injection] Can an attacker inject newlines, ANSI escape codes, or log format sequences into checker_name/headline/explanation strings to manipulate log parsing, hide malicious activity, or perform log injection attacks in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] No validation exists for empty or whitespace-only strings in checker_name/headline/explanation - can this cause issues in downstream systems that expect non-empty identifiers or explanations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Resource Exhaustion] The links Vec<String> has no size limit - can an attacker add millions of links to cause memory exhaustion, slow serialization, or DoS when these results are transmitted over the network or stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: links()] [URL Validation] The links builder method accepts any strings without validating they are valid URLs - can an attacker inject malicious links (javascript:, data:, file:// URIs) that could be clicked by operators reviewing health check results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Phishing Attack] Can malicious checker implementations populate the links field with phishing URLs disguised as legitimate documentation to compromise node operators who trust health check remediation links? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: links()] [Open Redirect] If links are used to redirect users without validation, can an attacker control the links vector to perform open redirect attacks that funnel operators to malicious sites while appearing to come from trusted health check infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckResult] [Deserialization Attack] CheckResult derives Deserialize - can a malicious actor craft a JSON/binary payload with extremely large strings or nested structures that consume excessive memory during deserialization, causing DoS on the health check API? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckSummary] [Deserialization DoS] CheckSummary's check_results Vec can be deserialized with millions of elements - can an attacker send a malicious payload with an enormous Vec to exhaust memory or CPU during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Information Disclosure] Both structs derive Serialize without field-level control - could this inadvertently leak sensitive debugging information if checker_name or explanation contains internal system details that shouldn't be exposed via API? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Score Threshold Logic] The summary_explanation uses arbitrary thresholds (>95: Awesome, >80: Good, >50: Getting there) - can these thresholds be exploited by attackers who know that scoring exactly 51 will produce misleadingly positive feedback despite failing checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Averaging Bias] Simple arithmetic mean treats all checkers equally - can an attacker add many trivial checkers with high scores (e.g., 'server responds to ping: 100') to dilute the impact of critical failing checks and inflate overall health scores? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: from()] [Score Interpretation] A node with summary_score of 51 gets 'Getting there!' message - could this cause operators to delay fixing critical issues because the system presents marginally-failing nodes as acceptable, leading to validator downtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Struct: CheckSummary] [Aggregation Method] The comment 'method TBA' suggests the aggregation logic is temporary - are there known issues with the current mean-based approach that could be exploited before a weighted or priority-based system is implemented? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/types.rs] [Function: links()] [State Mutation] The links() builder consumes self and returns modified self - can this pattern be abused to create race conditions if CheckResult is shared across threads and links() is called concurrently? (Low)"
