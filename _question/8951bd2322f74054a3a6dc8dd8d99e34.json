(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: verify_proof()] [PubKey type mismatch] Line 158 uses pk: &Self::PubKey which is DealtPubKey (line 44) - if this pk is from a different DKG ceremony than the proof, will verification pass or fail? Can cross-ceremony proofs be valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: verify_proof()] [Error message only] Lines 169-171 bail with error message on verification failure - is the error message logged? Can timing side-channels in error handling leak information about which part of verification failed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Overall design] [Consensus randomness] If this BLS VUF is used for leader election or randomness beacon in Aptos consensus, can the random_scalar() bug at line 87 allow Byzantine validators to manipulate leader selection, causing censorship or unfair block rewards?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Overall design] [Proof share flooding] Can Byzantine validators flood the network with invalid proof shares that fail verify_share(), forcing honest validators to waste CPU on pairing checks and delaying aggregation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Overall design] [Aggregation denial] Can Byzantine validators with >1/3 stake refuse to provide proof shares, preventing aggregate_shares() from completing and stalling randomness generation? (High)",
