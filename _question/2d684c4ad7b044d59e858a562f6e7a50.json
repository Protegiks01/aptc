  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Notification ordering guarantee] Does the channel implementation guarantee FIFO ordering for notifications, or can they be reordered causing commits to be applied out-of-sequence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Target version checking] Is there validation that the target version is greater than current version, or can syncing to older versions cause chain rollback and double-spending?
