  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Response Leakage] Does the debug log at lines 109-113 expose valid captcha tokens or verification responses that could be used for replay attacks if an attacker gains log access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [JSON Injection] At lines 102-104, can an attacker manipulate Google's API response (via MITM or compromised DNS) to inject malicious JSON that exploits serde_json parsing vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Response Size] Is there a maximum size limit for the response text at lines 90-93, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by making Google return an extremely large response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Success Field] At line 106, does the code properly handle cases where resp['success'] is missing, null, or not a boolean, or can malformed responses bypass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [unwrap_or Default] Can an attacker exploit the unwrap_or(false) fallback at line 106 by causing JSON parsing to succeed but return unexpected data types for the 'success' field? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Codes] Does the code at line 106 check Google's error-codes field to distinguish between expired tokens, invalid tokens, and other failures, or does it treat all failures the same? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Challenge TS] Does the implementation verify the challenge_ts timestamp from Google's response to prevent old captcha tokens from being reused hours or days later? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Hostname] Does the code verify the 'hostname' field in Google's response to ensure the captcha was solved on the legitimate faucet domain and not an attacker's phishing site? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Async Race] Can multiple concurrent requests with the same captcha token at line 82 cause race conditions where all requests pass verification before Google marks the token as used? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between captcha verification at line 106 and actual fund disbursement, allowing token reuse in the time window? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Struct: CaptchaChecker] [Shared State] Is the CaptchaChecker struct at line 37 properly thread-safe when called concurrently, or can shared state corruption occur in high-load scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation] Does the constructor at lines 42-44 validate that the google_captcha_api_key is not empty, null, or a placeholder value before accepting the configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Struct: GoogleCaptchaCheckerConfig] [Key Rotation] Is there a mechanism to rotate the google_captcha_api_key at line 34 without restarting the service, or can a compromised key continue to be used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Handling] Does the Ok(Self { config }) at line 43 perform any validation, or can invalid configurations (wrong key format) be accepted and cause runtime failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Dry Run Bypass] At line 63, the _dry_run parameter is ignored—can attackers exploit this to perform actual captcha verification during eligibility checks, causing rate limit exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Side Effects] Since dry_run is ignored at line 63, does every eligibility check consume a captcha token with Google, allowing attackers to exhaust valid tokens without receiving funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty Vec] At line 107, returning an empty vec signals success—can any error paths accidentally return an empty vec, allowing unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Rejection Reason] Are the RejectionReason messages at lines 70-73 and 117-120 properly logged and monitored to detect captcha bypass attempts? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: cost()] [Checker Order] Does the cost value of 10 at line 124 properly prioritize this checker, or could attackers exploit checker ordering to bypass captcha by triggering earlier rejections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: cost()] [Resource Usage] Is the cost value at line 124 accurate for actual resource consumption, or could captcha verification be more expensive than indicated, allowing DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [HTTP Method] Does the POST request at line 78 use HTTPS exclusively, or can an attacker downgrade to HTTP and intercept/modify the API key and captcha tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Redirect Following] Does the reqwest client at lines 77-87 follow HTTP redirects, potentially allowing attackers to redirect to malicious endpoints and capture API keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/google_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Request Headers] Are proper User-Agent and other security headers set on the request at line 78 to prevent fingerprinting or blocking by Google? (Low)",
