  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Missing time-based attacks] Are time manipulation attacks (timestamp forging, timeout manipulation, clock skew exploits) adequately represented in SecurityEvent variants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Unexpected mutations] Could the Copy trait on SecurityEvent lead to accidental event duplication or lost context if log aggregation systems don't handle duplicates properly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Serde: rename_all] [External compatibility] Does the snake_case serialization format for SecurityEvent create compatibility issues with monitoring tools expecting different casing conventions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Serde: Configuration] [Missing tag] Should SecurityEvent use serde's 'tag' attribute for better type discrimination in log aggregation systems analyzing multiple Aptos chains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Log retention] Are there guarantees about SecurityEvent log retention periods, ensuring attack forensics and slashing evidence remain available long enough? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Log tampering] Could validator operators tamper with local SecurityEvent logs to hide their own Byzantine behavior before sharing logs with other validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Audit trail] Do SecurityEvents include sufficient immutable audit trail information (block height, epoch, hash chains) to prove when attacks occurred on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Pattern detection] Does the simple enum structure prevent automated pattern detection (e.g., 'same validator sending invalid messages across multiple rounds') for identifying sophisticated attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Enum: SecurityEvent] [Correlation IDs] Do SecurityEvents lack correlation IDs to link related security violations (e.g., invalid proposal → invalid votes → block rejection), making attack reconstruction difficult? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Privacy concerns] Could SecurityEvent logging inadvertently capture PII or sensitive transaction data that violates privacy regulations when logs are shared for security analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/security.rs] [Module: security] [Compliance logging] Are there gaps between SecurityEvent coverage and compliance requirements (e.g., SOC2, ISO27001) for security monitoring in blockchain infrastructure? (Low)"
