  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [No validation] Does new() perform any validation on its parameters, or can completely invalid UriMutation instances be constructed with arbitrary data causing downstream failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [URI consistency] Is there any check that old_uri != new_uri, or can identical URIs be used creating meaningless mutation events that pollute event logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [String cloning cost] Since new() takes owned Strings, could repeated event creation with large strings cause memory allocation pressure or fragmentation affecting node performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [Type invariants] Does new() maintain any invariants that could be violated by direct struct construction if the struct fields were made public in a future change? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: collection()] [Mutable aliasing] Do any getter methods return mutable references that could allow external code to modify internal state, breaking event immutability guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: token()] [Reference invalidation] If the UriMutation struct is moved while holding a reference from token(), can this cause dangling references or memory unsafety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: old_uri()] [Clone vs reference] Should getters return cloned Strings instead of references for safety, or can the current reference-returning design lead to lifetime issues in complex calling contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: new_uri()] [Interior mutability] Are there any RefCell, Mutex, or other interior mutability patterns that could allow mutation through the immutable reference returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [All getters] [Panic safety] Can any getter methods panic (e.g., if strings contain invalid UTF-8 internally), causing validator node crashes during event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] Is the MODULE_NAME constant 'token_event_store' guaranteed to match the actual Move module name, or can mismatches cause event type resolution failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Type args mismatch] Does the empty type_args vector in URI_MUTATION_TYPE match the actual Move struct definition, or can type argument mismatches cause runtime failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Constant: MODULE_NAME] [Immutability] Is MODULE_NAME truly immutable at runtime, or can module reloading or hot-patching mechanisms modify it causing type resolution inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Constant: STRUCT_NAME] [Encoding assumptions] Are the IdentStr constants properly validated to match Move naming rules, or can invalid identifiers cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Can concurrent first access to URI_MUTATION_TYPE from multiple threads cause race conditions in the Lazy initialization, potentially creating duplicate or inconsistent TypeTag instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_TYPE] [Token address trust] Is TOKEN_ADDRESS guaranteed to be the correct address (0x3), or can it be manipulated in test environments causing event type mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_TYPE] [Memory leak] Does the Lazy<TypeTag> properly clean up on shutdown, or can it cause memory leaks in long-running validator nodes? (Low)",
