(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/seqs_in_binop_checker.rs] [Function: contains_control_flow_redirections()] [Empty expressions] Does visit_pre_order handle empty or null expressions gracefully, or can they cause traversal to terminate early? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/seqs_in_binop_checker.rs] [Function: check_function() visitor closure] [Spec function calls] Are spec functions (functions only for verification) checked by this validator, or can they contain unsafe sequences that bypass runtime safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/seqs_in_binop_checker.rs] [Function: check_function() visitor closure] [Prover hints] Can prover hints or inline specs introduce sequences within binary operations that should be validated but aren't? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/env_pipeline/seqs_in_binop_checker.rs] [Function: check_function() visitor closure] [Ghost code] Does the checker validate ghost code (code only visible to prover) which might have different semantics than runtime code? (Low)"
