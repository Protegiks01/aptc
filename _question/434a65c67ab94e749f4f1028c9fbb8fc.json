  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Index validation] Does the check 'txn_idx <= dep_txn_idx' properly prevent all invalid dependency relationships, or can wrapping after overflow cause valid-looking but incorrect dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Dependency zombie] After checking is_executed(dep_txn_idx) returns false and before pushing to stored_deps, can dep_txn_idx complete execution, causing the dependency to never be resolved? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Mutex acquisition order] The function acquires dependency mutex then status mutex - can this ordering deadlock with other functions that acquire in opposite order? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Condvar creation] Is creating a new Arc<(Mutex, Condvar)> for each dependency efficient, or can memory allocation failures cause panics that corrupt scheduler state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Suspend failure handling] When suspend() returns false due to ExecutionHalted, is the dependency still added to stored_deps, creating a memory leak of unresolvable dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wake_dependencies_after_execution()] [Vector take operation] Does mem::take() on stored_deps properly clear the vector while holding the lock, or can concurrent wait_for_dependency add dependencies that get lost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wake_dependencies_after_execution()] [Min dependency calculation] When finding min_dep, can the comparison 'min_dep > dep' overflow if dep is u32::MAX, causing incorrect minimum to be selected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wake_dependencies_after_execution()] [Resume failure] If resume() fails with PanicError for one dependency, does the function still process remaining dependencies, or does early return leave some dependencies unresolved? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: wake_dependencies_after_execution()] [Fetch_min timing] Is calling fetch_min after all resume() calls the correct order, or should it be called before to ensure dependencies can grab the decreased execution index?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: next_task()] [Infinite loop] The function loops indefinitely until done() returns true - can a race cause done_marker to never be set, leading to permanent CPU spinning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: next_task()] [Retry starvation] When returning SchedulerTask::Retry, can a worker thread spin indefinitely if both indices are beyond num_txns but done_marker is not set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: next_task()] [Load ordering] Are Acquire memory orderings on validation_idx and execution_idx sufficient to synchronize with all updates, or can Relaxed orderings in other functions cause stale reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Function: next_task()] [Preference logic] Can the prefer_validate condition be gamed by a malicious thread pattern to always prefer one type of task, causing starvation of the other task type? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Enum: SchedulerTask] [Task type confusion] Can ExecutionTask and ValidationTask be confused due to type erasure or unsafe code, causing a validation to be executed as a transaction or vice versa? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler.rs] [Enum: SchedulerTask::Retry] [Busy waiting] Does returning Retry cause workers to busy-wait and consume excessive CPU, or is there proper backoff/yielding in the caller? (Low)",
