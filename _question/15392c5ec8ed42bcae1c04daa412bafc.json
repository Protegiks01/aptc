  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/update_certifier.rs] [Function: start_produce()] [EpochState cloning] The Arc<EpochState> is cloned implicitly when passed to ObservationAggregationState - can modifications to validator verifier or voting power in the original EpochState affect ongoing certifications? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/update_certifier.rs] [Function: start_produce()] [Determinism violation] Are all validators guaranteed to produce identical QuorumCertifiedUpdates for the same payload, or can non-deterministic behavior (e.g., signature aggregation ordering) cause divergence?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/update_certifier.rs] [Function: start_produce()] [Signature verification bypass] Does ObservationAggregationState verify each partial signature before adding to the aggregate, or can unverified signatures be included causing invalid multi-signatures?
