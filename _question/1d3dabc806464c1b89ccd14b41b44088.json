(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/parser/mod.rs] [Function: parse_file()] [Error Propagation Bypass] At lines 183-188, if parse_file_string returns Err(ds), the error diagnostics are extended to diags but empty defs and comments are returned - can this allow partially-parsed invalid AST nodes to proceed to later compilation stages? (Medium)",
