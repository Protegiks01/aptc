  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: account_address()] [Input validation] Can an attacker provide a malformed address string that bypasses validation in str_to_account_address(), potentially causing parser confusion or allowing invalid addresses to be processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: account_address()] [Address injection] Can an attacker craft an address string with special characters, null bytes, or Unicode that passes AccountAddress::from_str() but causes issues in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: account_address()] [Case sensitivity] Does str_to_account_address() properly handle case variations in hex addresses (0x vs 0X, uppercase vs lowercase), or could case sensitivity lead to account confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: pool_address()] [Metadata validation] Can an attacker provide a SubAccountIdentifier with metadata containing an invalid pool_address that passes initial validation but causes fund loss or incorrect balance queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: pool_address()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft a sub_account with metadata.pool_address set to a malicious address while claiming it's a legitimate staking pool, potentially stealing delegated funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: pool_address()] [Null metadata] Does the function properly handle the case where sub_account exists but metadata is None, or could this lead to incorrect balance calculations for delegated stakes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: pool_address()] [Address spoofing] Can an attacker set metadata.pool_address to mimic a legitimate validator's pool address to redirect stake queries or operations to an attacker-controlled pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_operator_stake()] [Logic flaw] The function uses negative logic checking (!is_total_stake() && !is_active_stake()...) - can an attacker craft a sub-account type that doesn't match any category but still returns true for is_operator_stake()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_operator_stake()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker create a sub-account that passes is_operator_stake() but isn't actually an operator stake account, leading to incorrect operator reward distribution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_operator_stake()] [Missing checks] Does is_operator_stake() verify the address format matches 'stake-<operator_address>', or could arbitrary address strings pass as operator stakes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: is_operator_stake()] [Delegation bypass] Can an attacker craft a sub_account with metadata to bypass the is_operator_stake() check, potentially gaining operator privileges without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: operator_address()] [Error handling] When called on a non-operator account, the function returns InternalError - could this error message leak sensitive information about account structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: operator_address()] [Delegation to sub_account] Does operator_address() properly validate that the sub_account's operator_address() call succeeds before processing, or could this create a panic condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: str_to_account_address()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide an extremely long address string that causes buffer overflow or excessive memory allocation during AccountAddress::from_str() parsing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: str_to_account_address()] [Whitespace handling] Does str_to_account_address() properly strip leading/trailing whitespace, or could whitespace-padded addresses bypass validation while being treated differently in storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: str_to_account_address()] [Error message] The generic 'Invalid account address' error might hide specific parsing failures - could this prevent proper debugging or security incident investigation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: str_to_account_address()] [Hex prefix validation] Does the function enforce '0x' prefix requirement consistently, or could addresses without prefix cause confusion between hex and decimal representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_total_stake()] [Panic vulnerability] The function calls AccountAddress::from_str(pool).unwrap() which will panic on invalid input - can an attacker trigger a DoS by providing malformed pool addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_total_stake()] [Pool address validation] Does new_delegated_total_stake() verify that the pool address actually exists and is a valid staking pool, or could attackers reference non-existent pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_total_stake()] [Type safety] Can the pool parameter be manipulated to contain non-pool addresses (like regular accounts), leading to incorrect stake calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_active_stake()] [Panic vulnerability] Similar to new_delegated_total_stake(), this unwrap() can cause panic - can an attacker crash the Rosetta API by sending requests with invalid pool addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_active_stake()] [State confusion] Can an attacker create active stake sub-accounts for pools where they have no actual active stake, potentially confusing balance queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_pending_inactive_stake()] [Panic vulnerability] The unwrap() in this function can cause crashes - can attackers deliberately crash nodes by repeatedly calling with malformed pool addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_pending_inactive_stake()] [Unstaking manipulation] Can an attacker query pending_inactive_stake for pools they don't own to gather intelligence about validator unstaking patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: new_delegated_inactive_stake()] [Panic vulnerability] Another unwrap() that can panic on invalid pool addresses - does this create a repeatable DoS vector against the Rosetta API? (High)"
