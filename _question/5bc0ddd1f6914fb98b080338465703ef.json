  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, line 144] [State Mutation Without Lock] The NetworkController's mutable state is modified without any synchronization - if start() is called concurrently, can this cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, lines 155-166] [Incomplete Shutdown] The TODO comment on line 152 admits shutdown is 'not very clean' - can incomplete shutdown leave dangling async tasks, leaked resources, or open network connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, lines 157-159] [Panic on Shutdown] The inbound shutdown signal uses send(()).unwrap() - if the receiver is already dropped, this will panic and crash the node during shutdown. Can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, lines 161-165] [Silent Failure on Outbound] The outbound shutdown uses unwrap_or_else with only a warning - if shutdown fails, does this leave the outbound handler running indefinitely, leaking resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, line 156] [No Runtime Shutdown] The shutdown() method doesn't explicitly shutdown the inbound_rpc_runtime and outbound_rpc_runtime - are these leaked when NetworkController is dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, lines 155-166] [Double Shutdown] If shutdown() is called multiple times, Option::take() returns None - is the second call silently ignored, or could this cause issues in cleanup order dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, line 162] [Empty Message Signal] The shutdown signal sends Message::new(vec![]) - could a legitimate empty message be confused with a shutdown signal in the outbound handler, causing premature termination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, line 85] [Arc<Mutex> Safety] The inbound_handler uses Arc<Mutex> - if a thread panics while holding the lock, will this poison the mutex and prevent all subsequent message handling, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, lines 87-88] [Dual Runtime Synchronization] With separate inbound and outbound runtimes, are there any cross-runtime synchronization issues that could cause deadlocks or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, lines 89-90] [Option State Management] The shutdown handles are Options that are mutated - without proper synchronization, can concurrent access to these cause data races or UB in unsafe code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Lines 74-82] [GRPC Hang Comment] The comment warns about GRPC hangs with shared runtimes - has this potential hang been fully mitigated, or could specific timing conditions still trigger deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 120] [Unlimited Handler Registration] Can an attacker register unlimited outbound handlers for different message types/peers to exhaust memory in the handler Vec and HashMap? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: Message, line 56] [Raw Bytes Handling] Message contains raw Vec<u8> - is there any validation that this data is valid BCS encoding before passing to handlers, or can malformed data cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: Message::to_bytes, line 67] [Ownership Transfer] The to_bytes() method consumes self - could this cause use-after-move bugs if callers don't expect ownership transfer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, line 91] [Listen Address Validation] The listen_addr is stored but never validated - can binding to 0.0.0.0 or privileged ports cause security issues or conflicts with other services? (Medium)",
