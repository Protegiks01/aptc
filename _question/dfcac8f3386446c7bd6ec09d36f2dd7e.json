  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the svg_result_path PathBuf to write profiling output to arbitrary filesystem locations outside intended directories, potentially overwriting critical system files or validator configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: end_profiling()] [Path Traversal] Does the create_file_with_parents() call validate that svg_result_path doesn't contain path traversal sequences (../, /etc/, etc.) that could write flamegraph data to sensitive system locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: expose_svg_results()] [Path Traversal] Can svg_result_path be manipulated to read arbitrary files from the filesystem through convert_svg_to_string(), potentially exposing validator private keys or consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Struct: CpuProfiler] [Access Control] Is there any validation that only authorized operators can instantiate CpuProfiler, or can any process/thread enable profiling to gather sensitive execution data about validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] Does the constructor validate that frequency parameter is within safe bounds, or can negative/zero/extremely high values cause profiler crashes or resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Panic Handling] The unwrap() call on ProfilerGuard::new() at line 52 can panic if profiler initialization fails - can this be triggered remotely to crash validator nodes during benchmarking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: start_profiling()] [Panic Handling] Line 65 uses unwrap() on ProfilerGuard::new() - if profiling is already active or system resources exhausted, will this panic and crash the executor-benchmark process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: frames_post_processor()] [Panic Handling] The regex unwrap() at line 39 assumes regex compilation never fails - can malformed regex patterns in thread names cause panics during profiling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: end_profiling()] [Error Suppression] Lines 73-80 silently ignore report.build() errors with if let Ok() - could critical profiling errors be hidden that indicate memory corruption or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Error Suppression] Line 55-58 silently ignores report.build() failures - could this hide evidence of profiler tampering or malicious manipulation of execution data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can extremely large duration_secs values cause thread::sleep to block for days/years, effectively DoS'ing the benchmarking process and preventing profiling results collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Memory Exhaustion] If profiling runs with very high frequency value for long durations, can unbounded sample accumulation in ProfilerGuard exhaust memory and crash the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: start_profiling()] [Resource Leak] If start_profiling() is called multiple times without calling end_profiling(), does the guard replacement leak the previous ProfilerGuard and its accumulated samples? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: end_profiling()] [Disk Exhaustion] Can repeated profiling runs with large flamegraphs fill up disk space on validator nodes, causing consensus/storage failures when disk becomes full? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Struct: CpuProfiler] [CPU DoS] Can profiling with extremely high frequency values (approaching microsecond sampling) create so much overhead that validator nodes cannot keep up with consensus requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: set_guard()] [Race Condition] Is set_guard() thread-safe? Can concurrent calls from multiple threads corrupt the guard state or cause use-after-free if one thread reads while another writes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: destory_guard()] [Race Condition] Can end_profiling() and destory_guard() be called concurrently, causing double-free or accessing already-dropped ProfilerGuard? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: end_profiling()] [Race Condition] The guard.take() at line 72 and subsequent guard access are not atomic - can another thread call set_guard() between take() and report generation causing data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Struct: CpuProfiler] [Concurrent Access] The CpuProfiler struct lacks any synchronization primitives (Mutex/RwLock) - can multiple threads simultaneously call start_profiling() and end_profiling() causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/cpu_profiler.rs] [Function: profile_for()] [Concurrency] If multiple threads call profile_for() concurrently, do they interfere with each other's profiling sessions, potentially mixing samples from different execution contexts? (Medium)",
