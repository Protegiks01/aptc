  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization vulnerability] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that cause try_from_bytes() to deserialize into a valid DepositEvent with an amount value different from what was originally serialized, potentially allowing deposit amount manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization DoS] Does try_from_bytes() properly validate input size limits before calling bcs::from_bytes(), or can an attacker provide extremely large byte arrays that exhaust memory during deserialization and cause validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can try_from_bytes() be exploited by providing BCS bytes that deserialize into a valid DepositEvent structure but with malformed internal data that violates invariants when accessed by amount() getter?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic on invalid input] Can specially crafted invalid BCS bytes cause bcs::from_bytes() to panic instead of returning an error, potentially crashing validator nodes during event processing? (High)",
