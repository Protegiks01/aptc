  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [No constant-time guarantees] None of the functions document constant-time execution - can timing variations across all functions leak aggregate information about validator RNG state through network timing analysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [RNG trait compatibility] The module uses both rand::Rng and rand_core traits - can version mismatches between these crates cause RNG implementations to be incorrectly accepted, introducing weak randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [No entropy estimation] None of the functions verify RNG has sufficient entropy before sampling - can entropy starvation in /dev/random on validator nodes cause repeated random values, breaking consensus security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [Hash function weakness] The unsafe_hash_to_affine function uses SHA3-512 - if a collision is found in SHA3-512, can attackers generate multiple different random byte sequences that hash to the same curve point, breaking uniqueness assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [Counter exhaustion] The unsafe_hash_to_affine iterates counter 0..255 - if no valid point is found (1/2^256 probability claimed), the panic at line 50 in hashing.rs crashes the validator - can attackers force this by manipulating curve parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [DST length validation] The unsafe_hash_to_affine expects DST length ≤ 255 bytes - can integer truncation at line 28 in hashing.rs cause silent DST corruption if 'unsafe_random_point' string is modified, breaking domain separation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [Cofactor multiplication timing] The mul_by_cofactor operation in unsafe_hash_to_affine at line 46 in hashing.rs - does this execute in constant time, or can timing leaks reveal information about the hashed point's subgroup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [from_random_bytes determinism] The from_random_bytes call at line 45 in hashing.rs must be deterministic - if different arkworks versions produce different points from same bytes, can this cause consensus divergence across validators with mixed versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: sample_field_element()] [Statistical distribution] Can the rejection sampling bias at line 79-92 be measured through statistical tests on generated field elements, and if detected, can attackers use this to predict validator randomness in leader election? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point_slow()] [Discrete log relationship] Since the discrete log is known at line 27-29, can attackers who compromise validator memory extract these scalars and reconstruct private keys used in DKG protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_points()] [Point correlation] When generating n points with sequential RNG calls at line 68, can linear relationships between points be exploited to solve discrete log problems faster than generic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes()] [Modular bias] The modular reduction at line 103 - if 2*num_bytes is not sufficiently larger than modulus, can the bias be measured and exploited to predict validator scalars with success probability > 1/|F|? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [RNG reseeding] None of the functions verify RNG has been recently reseeded - can predictable patterns emerge after generating millions of samples, compromising long-running validator randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: sample_field_element()] [num_bits overflow] If F::MODULUS_BIT_SIZE at line 81 is corrupted or incorrectly specified as u32::MAX, can the as usize conversion overflow on 32-bit platforms, causing incorrect buffer sizes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [Stack vs heap allocation] The 32-byte array at line 52 is stack-allocated - can stack smashing attacks overwrite this buffer if adjacent stack data is corrupted, introducing controlled randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: sample_field_elements()] [Iterator efficiency] The map iterator at line 73 - can this cause stack overflow for extremely large n values if Rust doesn't optimize the iterator chain, crashing validator nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_points_slow()] [Generator caching] Is C::generator() at line 29 cached or recomputed each call - if recomputed, can attackers exploit timing differences to leak information about the curve implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [Shared RNG state] If multiple threads share the same RNG reference when calling these functions, can race conditions in RNG state updates cause duplicate or correlated random values, breaking cryptographic uniqueness assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: sample_field_element()] [Rejection loop atomicity] Can thread context switches during the rejection loop at line 79 cause timing variations that leak information about RNG state to other threads via shared cache? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_points()] [Parallel generation] If validators parallelize point generation by calling this function from multiple threads, can memory ordering issues cause inconsistent point sequences across validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_point()] [Panic propagation] If unsafe_hash_to_affine panics at line 57, does the 32-byte buffer at line 52 get properly zeroed during stack unwinding, or can panic handlers leak sensitive random bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: sample_field_element()] [OOM handling] If Vec allocation fails at line 85 due to memory exhaustion, does the panic handler safely terminate the validator node, or can partial state corruption occur affecting subsequent consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes()] [from_le_bytes_mod_order failure] Can F::from_le_bytes_mod_order() at line 103 ever fail or panic for valid inputs, and if so, would this crash validator nodes during critical randomness generation for block proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [Arkworks version compatibility] The module comment at line 6 mentions version differences with arkworks - can using incompatible arkworks versions cause from_random_bytes() to produce different field elements from same inputs, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Module-wide] [rand crate version] The module uses 'our version of rand crate' at line 7 - can version skew between rand versions cause CryptoRng trait implementations to be incorrectly accepted, introducing weak randomness? (High)"
