  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Cost Accumulation] In lines 261-301, can the cost accumulation logic be bypassed by crafting gas events that are filtered out by the match statement but still consume resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Loc Event Exclusion] Line 275 excludes Loc and Call events from cost calculation - can attackers abuse this to hide costs in Loc events that should be counted, causing underreported gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Intrinsic Cost] Line 266 adds intrinsic_cost without validation - can this be set to zero or negative to bypass minimum transaction costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Keyless Cost] Can the keyless_cost field in line 267 be manipulated in keyless transactions to underreport authentication costs, enabling cheap spam attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Dependency Iteration] Lines 269-271 iterate dependencies - can circular or duplicate dependencies cause the same cost to be added multiple times, or can missing dependencies cause underreported costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Optional Transaction Transient] Lines 283-285 conditionally add transaction_transient if Some - can attackers set this to None to skip legitimate costs that should always be charged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: ExecutionAndIOCosts::assert_consistency] [Panic Vulnerability] Line 296 panics on inconsistency - can malicious transactions deliberately create inconsistent gas logs to crash validators and halt the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteTransient] [StateKey Collision] Can attackers craft WriteTransient entries with colliding StateKey values to confuse gas accounting or cause the same write to be charged multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteTransient] [Op Type Mismatch] Can the WriteOpType be manipulated to claim a Modification when actually doing Creation, paying lower transient costs for expensive operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteTransient] [Deletion Cost Bypass] Can Deletion operations have zero or minimal cost values, allowing attackers to delete large amounts of state for free? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteStorage] [Refund Exploitation] Can the refund field exceed the cost field, allowing attackers to profit from write operations and drain storage fee pools? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteStorage] [Cost-Refund Race] Can concurrent modifications to cost and refund fields create race conditions where refunds are issued before costs are charged, enabling free writes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: WriteStorage] [Zero Cost Creation] Can Creation operations have zero cost but non-zero refund, allowing creation of state that provides refunds without payment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: EventTransient] [Type Tag Complexity] Can attackers emit events with extremely complex TypeTag structures that have minimal cost but consume excessive validator resources during processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: EventTransient] [Cost Underflow] Can event transient costs be set to negative values through integer underflow, causing the total gas to decrease when events are emitted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: EventStorage] [Event Discount Bypass] Does the EventStorage cost properly account for event_discount, or can attackers structure events to receive discounts without paying appropriate base costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: EventStorage] [Type Confusion] Can attackers use identical TypeTag values for different event types to confuse storage cost calculation and pay incorrect fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Size Manipulation] Can the size field be manipulated to underreport the actual byte size of dependencies, causing incorrect gas charges for loading large modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Kind Exploitation] Can attackers mark dependencies as Existing when they are New to avoid higher costs associated with loading new modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Function: Dependency::render] [Format String] Does the render() function properly sanitize ModuleId for display, or could malicious module IDs inject formatting codes that corrupt gas logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: TransactionGasLog] [Batch Count Manipulation] Can the num_txns field be manipulated to misrepresent the number of transactions in a batch, causing incorrect per-transaction gas calculations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Determinism Across Validators] Do all validators calculate identical TransactionGasLog structures for the same transaction, or can floating-point operations, hash map iteration, or architecture differences cause divergent gas logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Consistency Check Timing] Are assert_consistency methods called atomically with transaction execution, or can race conditions allow inconsistent gas logs to be committed to state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Memory Limits] Is there a maximum size limit for TransactionGasLog structures, or can attackers create transactions with gigabytes of gas event data that exhaust validator memory? (Critical)"
