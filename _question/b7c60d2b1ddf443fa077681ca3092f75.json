  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_msg.rs] [Interaction: SyncInfo] [QC Chain Validity] When sync_info contains multiple certificates, does verify() ensure they form a valid chain, or could disconnected certificates cause safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_msg.rs] [Interaction: SyncInfo] [Timeout Certificate Missing] If sync_info.highest_2chain_timeout_cert() is None but vote has a two_chain_timeout, could this create inconsistencies in timeout processing? (Medium)",
