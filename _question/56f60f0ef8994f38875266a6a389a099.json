  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Feature Flag Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker trigger a feature flag downgrade that causes previously secure dispatch calls to use weaker `legacy_check_visited()` validation retroactively? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Argument Reordering] After `extract_function_info()` removes the last argument, can an attacker exploit the remaining arguments order to pass wrong parameters to the dispatched function causing unauthorized operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Type Argument Mismatch] Can an attacker provide `ty_args` that don't match the dispatched function's generic parameters, causing type confusion or bypassing Move's resource safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Empty Arguments Attack] What happens if the `arguments` VecDeque is empty when `extract_function_info()` tries to pop the last element - can this cause a panic or bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Arguments.into_iter() Vulnerability] The conversion `arguments.into_iter().collect()` creates a Vec<Value> for the dispatch - can the iteration order be manipulated to reorder parameters maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Type Clone Attack] Can an attacker exploit the `ty_args.to_vec()` clone to cause resource exhaustion with extremely large type argument lists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Reference Mutation] If the arguments contain mutable references, can an attacker modify the referenced data after `extract_function_info()` but before dispatch, causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Error Propagation] The function returns a `SafeNativeError::FunctionDispatch` to instruct the VM - can an attacker craft conditions where this error is mishandled, causing the dispatch to skip or execute incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Abort Code 4 Exploitation] The `check_visited()` failure maps to abort code 4 - can attackers in Move code catch this specific abort and use it as a signal to exploit timing or state conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Error Handling Race] Can concurrent dispatch calls cause race conditions in error handling where one dispatch's error affects another's execution path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Extract Function Info Error] If `extract_function_info()` returns an error, the arguments VecDeque has already been mutated - can this partial state cause issues in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Gas Charge Error Recovery] If the gas charge fails after successful `check_visited()`, what cleanup occurs, and can attackers exploit partially executed state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Nested Error Masking] Can errors from the dispatched function mask or override the dispatch mechanism's errors, hiding security violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Parallel Dispatch Race] In parallel execution (Block-STM), can concurrent calls to different dispatchable operations on the same fungible asset cause race conditions leading to double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Context Mutation Race] Can concurrent modifications to `SafeNativeContext` by multiple dispatch calls cause inconsistent state in traversal context or feature flags? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Withdraw-Deposit Race] Can an attacker race `dispatchable_withdraw` and `dispatchable_deposit` calls to manipulate balances or bypass transfer restrictions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Balance Query Race] Can `dispatchable_derived_balance` return stale data during concurrent `dispatchable_withdraw`/`dispatchable_deposit` operations, enabling exploits based on incorrect balance information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Supply Manipulation Race] Can concurrent `dispatchable_derived_supply` queries and mint/burn operations cause supply calculation errors or overflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Traversal Context Race] Can multiple threads racing on `traversal_context().check_is_special_or_visited()` cause inconsistent 'visited' state, bypassing module verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Withdraw Overflow] Can the `dispatchable_withdraw` operation cause integer overflow when withdrawing maximum amounts, bypassing balance checks and enabling theft of more tokens than exist? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Withdraw Underflow] Can `dispatchable_withdraw` cause balance underflow for the source account, resulting in negative balances or unlimited withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Withdraw Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker dispatch `dispatchable_withdraw` to a malicious function that skips owner authorization checks, enabling theft from any account? (Critical)",
