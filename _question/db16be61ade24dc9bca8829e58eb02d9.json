  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Struct: AptosError] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker craft malicious input that causes the message field to leak sensitive internal state, validator information, or private keys through error messages exposed via the API? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Struct: AptosError] [Data Validation] Does the AptosError struct validate message length, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by triggering errors with extremely long messages that get serialized and propagated across the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Struct: AptosError] [Type Confusion] Can vm_error_code being Option<u64> lead to inconsistent error handling where Some(0) and None are treated differently, potentially hiding critical VM errors from clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Struct: AptosError] [Serialization Attack] Are there any unsafe deserialization paths where a malicious AptosError payload could exploit the bcs or serde_json deserializers to cause crashes or RCE on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_error_code()] [Format String Injection] Can an attacker control the ErrorType parameter to inject format strings or escape sequences that corrupt logs or cause information disclosure when the error is formatted with format!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_error_code()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does format!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_error_code()] [Missing Validation] Can callers pass arbitrary error_code values including invalid enum discriminants that bypass the #[repr(u32)] safety guarantees, leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_error_code()] [Information Leakage] Does the generic ErrorType parameter allow internal error types containing sensitive data (private keys, validator secrets) to be exposed through the public API? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_vm_status()] [Integer Overflow] Can the cast 'vm_error_code as u64' on line 49 cause truncation or undefined behavior if StatusCode contains values outside u64 range, leading to incorrect error codes being reported? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_vm_status()] [VM Status Spoofing] Can an attacker craft transactions that trigger benign StatusCode values which get misreported, hiding critical VM failures like OUT_OF_GAS or INVALID_SIGNATURE from clients? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_vm_status()] [Type Safety Bypass] Does the conversion from StatusCode to u64 preserve all security-critical information, or can distinct error states collide, allowing attackers to disguise transaction failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: new_with_vm_status()] [Status Code Injection] If StatusCode enum is ever extended with new variants, could backward compatibility issues cause old clients to misinterpret critical security errors as non-critical ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Log Injection] Can newlines or control characters in self.message cause log injection attacks when errors are written to logs, potentially hiding malicious activity or corrupting audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Debug Information Disclosure] Does the {:?} format for error_code expose internal enum representation details that could help attackers understand system internals for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Performance DoS] Can extremely long messages combined with the {:#} alternate formatting cause quadratic time complexity or excessive memory allocation during error formatting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: AptosErrorCode] [Error Code Collision] Are the error code values (101-603) guaranteed to be unique, or could duplicate values across different enum variants cause clients to misinterpret error types and bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: AptosErrorCode] [Enum Discriminant Exhaustion] Can adding new error codes beyond the current range cause conflicts with VM error codes or other subsystems, leading to error code collisions and security confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: AptosErrorCode::AccountNotFound] [Account Enumeration] Can an attacker use AccountNotFound (101) responses to enumerate valid account addresses, violating privacy and enabling targeted attacks against high-value accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: AptosErrorCode::ResourceNotFound] [Resource Discovery] Can ResourceNotFound (102) be exploited to probe for the existence of specific resources at accounts, leaking information about account balances or holdings? (Low)",
