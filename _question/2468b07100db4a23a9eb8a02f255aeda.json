  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Case Sensitivity] The function converts addresses to lowercase implicitly through comparisons with 'f'. Are uppercase hex letters (A-F) properly handled, or can mixed-case addresses cause filter bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [UTF-8 Issues] The function operates on String which guarantees UTF-8. Can non-ASCII hex-like Unicode characters (e.g., fullwidth digits ０-９) bypass address validation? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Function: add_trace()] [Unbounded Growth] The add_trace() appends to filter_path Vec without bounds checking. Can deeply nested filters cause unbounded growth of the trace path, consuming excessive memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Trait: Display for FilterError] [Formatting DoS] The Display implementation joins all trace paths into a single string. For complex filters with many trace steps, can this cause excessive string allocation and formatting overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Function: new_from_proto()] [Size Validation] The function checks max_filter_size against proto_filter.encoded_len().

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/mod.rs] [Integration: Builder Pattern] [Partial Construction] The builder pattern allows incremental construction.
