  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Runtime worker starvation] If the named runtime at line 52 is shared with other tasks, can malicious long-running API requests starve other critical tasks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Spawn blocking abuse] Can the spawn_blocking calls at lines 66, 90 exhaust the blocking thread pool, causing legitimate blocking operations to queue indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Interval drift] Do the tokio::time::interval calls at lines 62, 86 account for task execution time, or can they drift causing gas estimations at incorrect times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Task leak] If the runtime is dropped before the spawned tasks at lines 61, 85 complete, are they properly cancelled or do they continue running as zombies? (Medium)",
