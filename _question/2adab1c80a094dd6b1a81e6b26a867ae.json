  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Transaction Atomicity] Does the immediate process exit violate transaction atomicity guarantees, where a panic during transaction execution could leave some state changes committed while others are rolled back? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Merkle Tree Corruption] Can panics during Jellyfish Merkle tree updates cause process exits that leave internal tree nodes in inconsistent states, causing different validators to compute different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Write-Ahead Log] Is there a write-ahead log or journal that ensures consistency, or can process::exit(12) cause committed transactions to be lost because they were in memory buffers not yet flushed to disk? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Snapshot Inconsistency] If a panic occurs during state snapshot creation, can the process exit leave partial snapshots on disk that cause fast-sync nodes to download corrupted state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Pruning Corruption] Can panics during ledger pruning operations cause process exits that leave storage in an inconsistent state where some old data is deleted while references to it still exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Gas Metering Bypass] Can panics in gas metering code trigger VMState::VERIFIER exemption incorrectly, allowing transactions to execute without proper gas accounting and enabling DoS through resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Resource Safety Violation] If a panic occurs during Move resource transfer, can the process exit cause resources to be duplicated or destroyed in violation of Move's linear type guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Parallel Execution State] In Block-STM parallel execution, can panics in one transaction thread cause process exits that leave other transaction threads' state changes partially committed, breaking deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [VM Cache Corruption] Can panics leave the MoveVM's code cache or module cache in an inconsistent state that persists after restart, causing subsequent executions to use stale or corrupted bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Prologue/Epilogue] If panics occur during transaction prologue or epilogue execution, can this bypass critical validation logic like sequence number checks, enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: setup_panic_handler()] [Handler Registration Timing] If setup_panic_handler() is called late in the initialization sequence, can panics during early startup bypass the crash handler and exit with different exit codes, causing monitoring systems to misclassify failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: setup_panic_handler()] [Double Registration] Can setup_panic_handler() be called multiple times, and if so, does this create a chain of panic hooks that could cause stack overflow or other issues during actual panic handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Initialization Race] Can panics during validator initialization (before consensus starts) cause process exits that prevent proper error reporting to operators, making it hard to diagnose startup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: setup_panic_handler()] [Tokio Integration] Does the panic handler properly integrate with Tokio's panic handling, or can Tokio runtime panics bypass this handler and cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Restart Loop] Can an attacker craft inputs that cause panics on every validator restart, creating an infinite crash loop that effectively takes the validator offline permanently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Message Loss] If a panic occurs while a validator is sending critical consensus messages (votes, proposals), does process::exit(12) cause message loss that could prevent quorum formation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Connection State] Can process exits leave network connections in half-open states that cause peers to wait for responses indefinitely, degrading overall network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Sync Interruption] If a panic occurs during state synchronization from other validators, can the process exit corrupt the partially-downloaded state, requiring a full resync on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Mempool Corruption] Can panics during transaction broadcast or mempool operations cause process exits that lose pending transactions, affecting network liveness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Exit Code Abuse] Can attackers trigger specific types of panics to manipulate the exit code (12) to evade monitoring systems or make crashes appear as normal shutdowns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Log Tampering] If crash logs are the primary forensic evidence, can attackers trigger panics in ways that minimize backtrace information or hide their attack vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Metrics Loss] Does the immediate process exit prevent metrics and telemetry from being flushed to monitoring systems, hiding the true cause and frequency of validator crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Alert Fatigue] Can an attacker trigger low-severity panics repeatedly to create alert fatigue, making operators miss critical security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Key Material Exposure] Can the Backtrace in CrashInfo capture stack frames containing private keys, BLS signatures, or other cryptographic material in plaintext that gets written to logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/crash-handler/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_panic()] [Signature Interruption] If a panic occurs during BLS signature generation or aggregation, can the process exit leave partial signatures in memory that could be recovered from core dumps? (Medium)"
