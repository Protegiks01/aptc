  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Bytecode validation gap] Does the Modules struct perform any bytecode verification beyond ModuleId checks, or can malformed bytecode pass through to the Move VM and exploit execution vulnerabilities? (Critical)",

(High)",
