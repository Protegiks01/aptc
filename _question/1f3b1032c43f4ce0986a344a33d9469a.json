  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Display: ExecutionWaitRequest] Does the Display implementation provide enough information for debugging without exposing the future's internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Trait: StatelessPipeline] Is the NAME constant 'execution' unique across all pipeline phases, or could name collisions cause metric/logging confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Trait: process] Does the async fn process() signature properly handle cancellation tokens, or can it hang indefinitely without cancellation support? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Trait: Request/Response] Are the Request and Response associated types properly constrained to prevent type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Epoch: Boundary execution] If ExecutionWaitPhase processes a block at epoch boundary, can this cause execution with wrong validator set or epoch_state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Epoch: Reset during execution] If epoch reset occurs while process() is awaiting execution, does the future get cancelled or can stale epoch results be returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Epoch: Reconfiguration blocks] Does ExecutionWaitPhase handle reconfiguration suffix blocks correctly, or can incorrect timestamp handling cause consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Infrastructure: PipelinePhase wrapper] Does the PipelinePhase wrapper properly drain the execution_wait_phase_rx channel on shutdown, or can pending responses be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Infrastructure: Task counter] Can the ongoing_tasks counter become inconsistent if process() panics, causing incorrect reset behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Infrastructure: Reset flag] Is the reset_flag check atomic with message processing, or can race conditions cause messages to be processed after reset? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Infrastructure: Metrics] Does process() update BUFFER_MANAGER_PHASE_PROCESS_SECONDS metric correctly for both success and error cases? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Memory: Arc usage] Are the Arc<PipelinedBlock> references properly managed to prevent memory leaks or reference cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Memory: BoxFuture ownership] Can the BoxFuture in ExecutionWaitRequest be moved or copied in ways that violate Rust's ownership rules? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Memory: Drop safety] If ExecutionWaitRequest or ExecutionResponse are dropped before processing, can this cause resource leaks or dangling futures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Execution replay] Can an attacker cause the same execution to be replayed multiple times by resubmitting ExecutionWaitRequest with cached futures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: State poisoning] Can malicious execution results poison the state in ways that cause all subsequent executions to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Signature bypass] Does ExecutionWaitPhase verify any cryptographic signatures on execution results, or can unsigned results be injected? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Merkle root manipulation] Can execution return manipulated Merkle roots that don't match actual state, bypassing state verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Transaction ordering] Can Byzantine validators manipulate transaction ordering in execution to cause different state roots across honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Gas exploitation] Can execution futures bypass gas limits or return incorrect gas consumption values? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Validator set] Can execution be performed with incorrect validator set information, causing signature verification failures downstream? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_wait_phase.rs] [Attack: Commit votes] Does ExecutionWaitPhase's response enable correct commit vote generation, or can malformed responses prevent voting? (High)"
