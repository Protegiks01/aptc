  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Function: generate_openapi()] [Information Disclosure] Could the generated OpenAPI spec inadvertently expose sensitive implementation details, internal endpoints, or security mechanisms that should remain confidential in production deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Function: generate_openapi()] [Configuration Mismatch] If this spec generation uses FakeFunder but production uses different funders, could discrepancies between documented and actual API behavior mislead users into making insecure integration decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Struct: FundApiComponents] [Security Bypass Documentation] Does the generated spec accurately document that bypassers and checkers are empty, potentially misleading developers about the actual security controls present in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Struct: FundApiComponents] [Rate Limiting Documentation] With concurrent_requests_semaphore set to None in spec generation, does the documentation accurately reflect that production implementations should use rate limiting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Struct: CaptchaApi] [Security Feature Documentation] Does setting enabled=false in spec generation accurately document captcha availability, or could this mislead integrators about anti-abuse protections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Function: write()] [Path Traversal] When output_path is provided, could an attacker manipulate the path parameter to write the OpenAPI spec to arbitrary locations on the filesystem? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Function: write()] [File Overwrite] Does the write operation check if the target file exists and contains important data before overwriting it, potentially causing data loss? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/generate_openapi.rs] [Function: generate_openapi()] [Error Handling] Are filesystem errors (permissions, disk space) properly handled when writing specs, or could they cause the tool to fail silently? (Low)"
