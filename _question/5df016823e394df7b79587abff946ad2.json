  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Computation gas bypass] Does the SHA3-256 computation in the From implementation get properly metered for gas? Can attackers perform free cryptographic operations by constructing specific JSON structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Duplicate ids with different payloads] Can two UnsupportedJWKs with identical id but different payload bytes coexist in the system? If so, which one gets used during keyless validation, and can this be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: id()] [Memory leak potential] Does the clone() in id() at line 47 get properly freed in all code paths? Can memory leaks accumulate during high-frequency JWK operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Metadata tampering] Since there's no signature or authentication on the UnsupportedJWK struct itself, can it be tampered with after consensus but before use in keyless validation? (High)"
