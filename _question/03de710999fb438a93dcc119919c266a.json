  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Processor Name Collisions] Can multiple processors use identical name values, causing ambiguity in error attribution and making it impossible to determine which component actually failed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Recovery Deadlock] Can error handling code that calls inner() while holding locks cause deadlocks if the inner() method or error formatting requires additional locks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Version Arithmetic] When error version ranges are used in arithmetic operations (e.g., calculating retry intervals or batch sizes), can integer overflow or underflow occur if proper checked arithmetic isn't used? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Memory Safety in Error Drops] When TransactionProcessingError instances are dropped, can the anyhow::Error contained within trigger unsafe operations or access freed memory during cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Version Range Validation] Are there any runtime assertions or compile-time checks ensuring start_version <= end_version, or can inverted ranges propagate through the system unchecked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Handling During Shutdown] Can TransactionProcessingError instances created during indexer shutdown trigger additional panics or prevent graceful cleanup of database connections and resources? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Cross-Processor Error Propagation] When errors from one processor affect other processors (e.g., shared database connections), can ErrorWithVersionAndName instances carry incorrect processor names, misattributing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Aggregation] Can multiple TransactionProcessingError instances be safely aggregated or batched for reporting, or do they require exclusive access to shared resources causing contention? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Version Overflow in Differences] When computing version range differences (end_version - start_version), can overflow occur for ranges spanning the entire u64 space, causing incorrect batch size calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Clone Safety] If TransactionProcessingError needs to be cloned for retry logic, does it implement Clone correctly, or can shallow copies cause aliasing issues with internal error state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Function: inner()] [Panic Safety] Is inner() panic-safe, ensuring that partial state modifications during error extraction don't leave the error object in an inconsistent state if unwinding occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Error Context Loss] When ErrorWithVersionAndName is converted to strings or logged, can critical context (like stack traces, causality chains, or transaction hashes) be lost, hindering debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Handling in FFI] If the indexer needs to interoperate with non-Rust code via FFI, can TransactionProcessingError be safely marshaled across language boundaries without memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Type: ErrorWithVersionAndName] [Processor Name Buffer Overflow] Even though name is &'static str, can maliciously long processor names (generated by external configuration) cause buffer overflows in fixed-size log buffers or display code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/indexer/errors.rs] [Enum: TransactionProcessingError] [Error Priority Inversion] Do ConnectionPoolError and TransactionCommitError have different severity levels, and can mishandling priority cause critical TransactionCommitError to be treated as less severe ConnectionPoolError? (Medium)",
