  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [Partial cleanup] If remove_blocks_for_epoch_round() succeeds but remove_blocks_for_commit() fails (or vice versa), can this leave inconsistent state between payload and ordered stores? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [State sync race] Does the comment about 'racing with state sync process' indicate a real race condition where both state sync and commit callback update root concurrently, causing non-deterministic root values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [Round rollback] Can the condition 'ledger_info.commit_info().round() > root_commit_info.round()' be exploited to prevent root updates by sending commits with equal or lower rounds, stalling consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [Payload leak] After removing blocks for commit, are block payloads properly deallocated or do they remain in memory, causing memory exhaustion over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [Commit ordering] Does remove_blocks_for_epoch_round() properly handle out-of-order commit callbacks, or can late-arriving commits for old rounds delete newly inserted blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: handle_committed_blocks()] [Lock holding] Can handle_committed_blocks() be called while holding the ObserverBlockData mutex, and if so, can the internal operations deadlock with other consensus components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_block_payload()] [Signature bypass] Does the verified_payload_signatures boolean get properly validated before insertion, or can an attacker insert unverified payloads by setting this flag to true? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_block_payload()] [Duplicate payload attack] Can inserting multiple payloads for same epoch/round overwrite valid payloads with malicious ones, allowing payload substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_block_payload()] [Unbounded growth] Is there any limit on the number of payloads that can be inserted, or can an attacker exhaust memory by inserting payloads for millions of future rounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_block_payload()] [Payload tampering] After insertion but before verification, can the payload be modified in the store, allowing TOCTOU vulnerabilities in subsequent verify operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_ordered_block()] [Fork insertion] Can an attacker insert ordered blocks from competing forks, causing the ordered_block_store to contain conflicting blocks at same epoch/round? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_ordered_block()] [Out-of-order insertion] Does inserting blocks out of order (e.g., block N+2 before N+1) create gaps that break parent-child relationships and pipeline execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_ordered_block()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can an attacker insert blocks with incorrect timestamps that appear valid but cause issues in timeout calculations or round progression? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_pending_block()] [Unbounded pending queue] Can an attacker flood the system with pending blocks (blocks without payloads), exhausting memory before payloads arrive? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_pending_block()] [Metadata manipulation] Can the PendingBlockWithMetadata be crafted with malicious peer information or timestamps that cause incorrect behavior in remove_ready_pending_block()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: insert_pending_block()] [Priority inversion] Can inserting many high-round pending blocks cause low-round ready blocks to be starved and never processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: remove_ready_pending_block()] [Race condition] Between checking payload existence in remove_ready_block() and returning the block, can the payload be removed, causing execution of block without payload? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: remove_ready_pending_block()] [Wrong block removal] Can passing wrong epoch/round parameters cause removal of incorrect pending blocks, losing valid blocks and processing wrong ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: remove_ready_pending_block()] [Partial payload] If a pending block contains multiple blocks and only some payloads exist, can all_payloads_exist() be bypassed, executing some blocks without payloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: remove_ready_pending_block()] [Mutable reference aliasing] Does passing &mut self.block_payload_store to pending_block_store.remove_ready_block() create unsafe mutable aliasing if both stores share data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: remove_ready_pending_block()] [Starvation] Can blocks at higher rounds prevent lower round blocks from ever becoming 'ready', causing consensus to stall waiting for payloads that never arrive? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: root()] [Clone overhead] Does cloning the entire LedgerInfoWithSignatures on every call create performance issues that can be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
