  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Authentication tag forgery] Can fuzz data bypass AEAD authentication tag verification in the decryption process, allowing an attacker to inject forged encrypted messages that appear to come from a legitimate peer? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Error silencing] The result from peer.read() is discarded at line 201, but could this hide critical decryption errors that should trigger peer disconnection to prevent further attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Trailing data handling] Does set_trailing() at line 192 allow an attacker to append extra data after encrypted frames that gets incorrectly processed, potentially causing state corruption in message handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Message length exploitation] Can fuzz data with malformed length fields cause integer overflows when calculating plaintext size, leading to heap corruption in the decryption buffer allocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Async abort safety] If the async block at lines 199-202 is aborted mid-execution, could this leave NoiseStream in an inconsistent state where subsequent messages decrypt with corrupted keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Partial read handling] Does fuzzing test for partial encrypted frames that require multiple read() calls, or can an attacker exploit message fragmentation to cause state machine violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker send malformed encrypted messages that cause excessive memory allocation or CPU usage in decryption operations, leading to validator slowdowns affecting consensus performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: test_noise_fuzzers()] [Test coverage] Does this test at lines 212-218 only validate that fuzzers don't panic on valid messages, or does it also test that fuzzers properly exercise error handling paths with malformed inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: test_noise_fuzzers()] [Cross-contamination] Can using resp_msg for both fuzz_initiator and fuzz_post_handshake at lines 216-217 cause the fuzzers to miss vulnerabilities specific to initiator messages versus post-handshake encrypted messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: NoiseUpgrader] [Handshake state machine] Can an attacker exploit state machine transitions in NoiseUpgrader by sending handshake messages in unexpected order, causing the fuzzing harness to miss vulnerabilities that only occur during abnormal state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: NoiseStream] [Post-handshake encryption] Does fuzz_post_handshake adequately test the NoiseStream encryption/decryption implementation for side-channel attacks like timing analysis that could leak plaintext or key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: HandshakeAuthMode] [Auth mode bypass] Since both initiator and responder use server_only mode in lines 78 and 83, does this skip fuzzing of mutual authentication logic where an attacker might exploit timestamp validation to bypass anti-replay protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: AntiReplayTimestamps] [Timestamp validation] Does fake_timestamp completely disable fuzzing of AntiReplayTimestamps validation logic, missing vulnerabilities where an attacker could manipulate timestamps to replay handshake messages or cause timestamp storage exhaustion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: ReadWriteTestSocket] [Socket behavior] Can malicious peers exploit differences between ReadWriteTestSocket and real network sockets to perform attacks that work on production validators but are missed by fuzzing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Integration: x25519] [Key derivation] Does fuzzing test for weak or malformed x25519 keys that could reduce the effective key space and allow an attacker to brute-force session keys to decrypt validator communication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Async execution] [Race conditions] Can concurrent fuzz execution with block_on() cause race conditions in shared state (like KEYPAIRS) that lead to inconsistent cryptographic material across handshakes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Async execution] [Executor choice] Does using block_on from futures executor versus Tokio in production cause different async scheduling behavior that could hide timing vulnerabilities in the handshake protocol? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Error propagation] [Panic vs Result] Does the fuzzing harness properly distinguish between panics (programming errors) and Result errors (protocol violations), or could an attacker exploit panic paths to crash validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Fuzzing corpus] [Mutation strategy] Does the corpus generation only produce valid handshake messages, or are invalid/malformed messages included to test error handling paths where vulnerabilities often hide? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Fuzzing coverage] [Code paths] Does the fuzzing achieve high code coverage of the Noise protocol implementation including error paths, or do significant security-critical code paths remain untested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Fuzzing strategy] [Targeted fuzzing] Should the fuzzer use structure-aware mutation strategies that understand Noise protocol message format rather than blind byte-level fuzzing to find deeper vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Cryptography: Key agreement] [Small subgroup attack] Can an attacker send an x25519 public key that lies in a small subgroup, causing the key agreement to produce a shared secret with limited entropy that can be brute-forced?
