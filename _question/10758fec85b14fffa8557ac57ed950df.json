  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Collection Duration] If metric collection takes longer than the 10-second interval (line 187), does the next collection wait or skip, and could this cause timing drift that makes metric timestamps unreliable for correlation with events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: ROCKSDB_PROPERTIES] [Missing Metrics] If certain critical RocksDB properties exist but are not in ROCKSDB_PROPERTY_MAP (lines 33-71), could important database health indicators be missed, allowing storage issues to develop undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Database Abstraction Leakage] The function directly calls raw database methods like metadata_db_arc(), transaction_db_raw(), etc. (lines 114-135) - if these internal APIs change, could the metric collection break silently without updating this file? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Column Family Coupling] The tight coupling to specific CF enumeration functions means adding new databases or CFs requires updating this file - could new storage components be added without corresponding metric collection, creating monitoring gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Metrics: ROCKSDB_PROPERTIES] [Metric Manipulation] While metrics are read-only from the validator's perspective, if a Byzantine validator manipulates reported metrics (by modifying this code), could this mislead monitoring systems about the validator's true state, hiding malicious behavior from operators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/rocksdb_property_reporter.rs] [Function: update_rocksdb_properties()] [Performance Fingerprinting] If an attacker can observe metric collection timing via side channels, could they infer database sizes or activity patterns of honest validators to coordinate attacks when databases are under load? (Low)"
