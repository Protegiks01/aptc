  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Related: decode()] [Unknown tag handling] If decode() encounters an unknown tag byte (not in StateKeyTag enum), does StateKeyDecodeErr::UnknownTag properly prevent further processing, or can malformed state keys partially decode and corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Related: decode()] [Insufficient bytes] Can the StateKeyDecodeErr::NotEnoughBytes error be triggered maliciously by crafting truncated state keys that pass initial validation but fail during BCS deserialization, causing state lookup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Related: decode()] [BCS error propagation] When BCS deserialization fails in decode(), does the error properly indicate whether the failure is due to malicious input vs storage corruption, allowing appropriate recovery actions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Related: decode()] [Tag validation timing] Is the StateKeyTag validated before any BCS deserialization occurs, or can attackers cause BCS parser to process untrusted data before tag validation, potentially triggering parser vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Impl: Debug for StateKeyInner] [Information leakage] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information (private keys, internal addresses) through hex::encode() that could be logged and leaked in production validator logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Impl: Debug for StateKeyInner] [Format string injection] Can malformed TableItem keys or Raw bytes contain format string specifiers that cause panics or undefined behavior when printed via Debug formatting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Impl: Debug for StateKeyInner] [Large key handling] Does Debug formatting handle extremely large keys properly, or can printing huge state keys cause memory exhaustion in logging systems leading to validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Impl: Debug for StateKeyInner] [Hex encoding correctness] Is the hex::encode() used in Debug guaranteed to be bijective (one-to-one), or can different byte sequences produce identical hex representations causing debugging confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Handle forgery] Can an attacker create a TableItem with a forged TableHandle pointing to another user's table, bypassing access control and reading/modifying unauthorized table data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Key collision] Can two different semantic keys in different tables encode to the same TableItem state key if they share the same TableHandle and key bytes, causing cross-table data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Handle reuse] If a table is deleted and its handle is later reused, can old TableItem state keys still be decoded and accessed, potentially leaking deleted sensitive data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Key type mismatch] Does TableItem validate that the key bytes match the expected type for the table, or can attackers insert mistyped keys that cause type confusion during Move execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Handle size assumption] Does the encoding assume TableHandle is always a fixed size, and could changes to the AccountAddress size break decode compatibility and corrupt existing state keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: TableItem] [Empty handle] Can a TableItem have a TableHandle with value 0x0000...0000, and would this create ambiguity with uninitialized or null table references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: Raw] [Production usage] Although Raw is marked 'only used for testing', can it still be instantiated in production code, allowing attackers to bypass AccessPath and TableItem validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: Raw] [Arbitrary bytes] Can the Raw variant contain any arbitrary byte sequence including malformed data that crashes decoders or violates storage invariants when persisted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: Raw] [Tag value 255] Does using 255 as the Raw tag value have special significance (max u8 value), and could this cause arithmetic overflow or wraparound issues in tag processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: Raw] [Collision with valid keys] Can Raw state keys be crafted to collide with valid AccessPath or TableItem encodings, allowing testing artifacts to corrupt production state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Variant: Raw] [Size validation bypass] Does Raw bypass size limits applied to other variants, enabling attackers to create oversized state keys through testing interfaces that remain in production? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash collision resistance] Does the CryptoHasher derivation provide collision resistance for all StateKeyInner variants, or can attackers find collisions between different variants (e.g., AccessPath and TableItem with same hash)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash function choice] What underlying hash function does CryptoHasher use, and has it been audited for resistance against length-extension, preimage, and second-preimage attacks on state keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Domain separation] Does CryptoHasher include proper domain separation between StateKeyInner variants to prevent cross-variant hash collisions in the Merkle tree? (High)",
