  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: verify()] [Transaction Metadata] At line 272, PersistedAuxiliaryInfo is extracted from the iterator. If this metadata is corrupted or missing, can verification continue with default values, masking data integrity issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: run()] [Empty Range] At lines 211-214, if limit is 0, verification returns empty errors. Can an attacker provide start_version > end_version to bypass verification while reporting success? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: execute_and_verify()] [Empty Events] At line 394, expected_events can be empty vectors. Does comparison properly handle empty vs. non-empty event lists, or can this cause false positives/negatives? (Low)",
