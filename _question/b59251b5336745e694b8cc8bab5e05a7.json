  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandMetadata] [Default Values] The Default implementation creates epoch=0, round=0 - can this default be confused with genesis state and bypass initialization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [Default Randomness] Does Default create empty randomness bytes, and can this be exploited where uninitialized randomness is used in security-critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Default Seed] The default PerBlockRandomness has seed=None - can this default state be stored on-chain and break randomness availability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: FullRandMetadata] [Unsigned Block ID] Since block_id is 'not used for signing', can attackers forge block associations for valid randomness, causing randomness to be attributed to wrong blocks in fork scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandMetadata] [Metadata Forgery] Can attackers generate valid WVUF signatures over forged RandMetadata (wrong epoch/round) if the signing process doesn't properly validate metadata fields? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [Proof-Value Separation] Does separating the randomness bytes from the WVUF proof allow attackers to substitute randomness values while keeping valid proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Key Distribution Sync] Can delays in distributing certified_apks across validators cause some validators to accept randomness while others reject it, causing state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Config Propagation] Can delays in propagating PerBlockRandomness updates cause validators to use stale randomness for new blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [Metadata-Value Desync] Can RandMetadata be updated without corresponding randomness bytes update (or vice versa), causing mismatched state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Function: add_certified_apk()] [Malicious APK Certification] Can colluding Byzantine validators (< 1/3) certify each other's malicious APKs that appear valid but contain backdoors for randomness prediction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandKeys] [Selective Share Withholding] Can Byzantine validators strategically withhold their certified_apks for specific honest validators, preventing them from verifying shares and halting their consensus participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: Randomness] [Grinding Attack] Can Byzantine validators generate multiple candidate randomness values and selectively reveal shares to bias the final randomness toward favorable outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: RandMetadata] [Cross-Chain Replay] Can RandMetadata from another Aptos network (testnet, mainnet) be replayed if epoch/round values coincide, breaking randomness uniqueness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: FullRandMetadata] [Timestamp Replay] Can old randomness with updated timestamps bypass freshness checks, allowing expired randomness to be reused? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/randomness.rs] [Struct: PerBlockRandomness] [Epoch Rollback] Can attackers cause epoch values to decrease (through state corruption), making future randomness appear as past randomness and enabling replay? (Critical)"
