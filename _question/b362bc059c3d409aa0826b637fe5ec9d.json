  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 1-84] [Missing Metric] Is there a metric tracking processor start/stop events, or can processor lifecycle issues go undetected allowing processors to silently fail without triggering alerts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 1-84] [Missing Metric] Is there a metric tracking metric registration failures, creating a blind spot where metric initialization issues cannot be monitored or alerted on? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 1-84] [Missing Metric] Is there a histogram or summary tracking processor execution duration, or can performance degradation go unnoticed until processors completely fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 77-84] [Missing Metric] Is there a metric tracking the age of LATEST_PROCESSED_VERSION (lag behind current blockchain tip), or can severe indexing lag go undetected by monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 21-28] [Missing Metric] Does PROCESSOR_ERRORS include error type/category labels, or are all errors aggregated together preventing identification of specific error patterns attackers could exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 11-18] [Thread Safety] Can concurrent inc() calls on PROCESSOR_INVOCATIONS from multiple processor threads cause counter updates to be lost due to insufficient synchronization in the underlying Prometheus client? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 77-84] [Thread Safety] Can concurrent set() operations on LATEST_PROCESSED_VERSION from different processor threads cause race conditions where the final value doesn't match any processor's actual progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 50-56 + 41-47] [Thread Safety] Can concurrent increments to GOT_CONNECTION and UNABLE_TO_GET_CONNECTION from multiple threads cause the total count to become inconsistent with actual connection attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 4-7] [Dependency Vulnerability] Does the aptos_metrics_core dependency have known vulnerabilities in its Prometheus client implementation that could be exploited through metric operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 11-84] [Client Bug] Can bugs in the Prometheus client's label handling code be triggered by specific processor names, causing crashes or memory corruption in the indexer process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 11-84] [Export Vulnerability] Can crafted metric labels in any of the counters/gauges cause the Prometheus text format exporter to generate malformed output, breaking monitoring system parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 8] [Initialization Order] Can the once_cell Lazy initialization order cause issues if metrics are accessed before the Prometheus registry is fully initialized, leading to metric registration failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 11-84] [Static Lifetime] Do the Lazy<> static variables properly handle process forking or other unusual lifecycle events without causing metric state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 11-84] [Registry Conflict] Can multiple indexer instances in the same process space cause metric name conflicts in the global Prometheus registry, leading to registration panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 77-84] [Rollback Handling] If the indexer must rollback and reprocess transactions, is LATEST_PROCESSED_VERSION properly decremented, or does it remain at a high value causing monitoring to show incorrect progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 31-38] [Rollback Handling] During transaction reprocessing after a rollback, are PROCESSOR_SUCCESSES counts preserved or incremented again, causing double-counting and incorrect success rate metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/counters.rs] [Lines: 21-28] [Recovery] After an indexer crash and restart, are PROCESSOR_ERRORS counters reset or do they persist incorrect values from before the crash, causing confusion in error rate monitoring? (Low)"
