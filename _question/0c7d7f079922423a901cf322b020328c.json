  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: div_internal] [Fq12 computation asymmetry] The BLS12381Fq12 division at lines 55-62 operates on extension field elements that are 12x more expensive than Fr - can attackers exploit this asymmetry to cause validator slowdown while staying within gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Division chain amplification] Can attackers create long chains of dependent division operations that force validators to store many intermediate results in AlgebraContext, exhausting memory despite staying under the 1MB limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: div_internal] [Structure type switching cost] Can repeatedly switching between different structure types at lines 47-86 in sequential divisions cause instruction cache misses and performance degradation on validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Worst-case input exploitation] Can attackers craft field elements that maximize the computational cost of division at line 32 (e.g., elements requiring maximum iteration in inverse computation) to cause validator slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: div_internal] [Deserialized element validation] Can maliciously crafted serialized elements be deserialized and used in division operations at lines 25-26 without proper validation, causing division of invalid field elements? (High)",

(Medium)",
