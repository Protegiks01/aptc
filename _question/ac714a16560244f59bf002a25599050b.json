  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: fmt() for Display] [Panic in formatter] If the unsafe dereference in as_str() panics during formatting, can this leave the formatter in an inconsistent state or lose critical error information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: fmt() for Display] [Infinite loop] Can specially crafted Symbol strings cause infinite loops or excessive recursion when formatted, creating denial of service in logging systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Pool never shrinks] Since the pool never evicts entries, can an attacker cause unbounded memory growth by creating Symbols for unlimited unique strings, eventually exhausting validator memory and causing OOM crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Pool.insert() correctness] Does pool.insert() guarantee that the returned NonNull<Entry> remains valid for the entire program lifetime, or can internal pool operations invalidate it? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Entry deallocation] Although the pool never explicitly frees entries, can unsafe code elsewhere or memory corruption cause entries to be deallocated while Symbols still reference them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [String ownership] Does Cow::into_owned().into_boxed_str() properly transfer ownership to the pool, or can there be aliasing issues if the original string is still accessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<&str>] [Borrowed string lifetime] When converting from &str, does the implementation properly handle cases where the source string has a limited lifetime, potentially reading freed memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<String>] [String move semantics] When converting from String, does Cow::Owned properly take ownership, or can the original String be used-after-move in unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Drop implementation] Symbol doesn't implement Drop - should it decrement a reference count or mark entries as unused, or is the leak-by-design approach safe for all blockchain use cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Pool bucket collision] If hash collisions cause excessive entries in a single bucket, can this degrade insertion performance to O(n) and enable timing attacks that reveal information about stored strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [Move VM execution] Can invalid Symbols created through Move bytecode manipulation cause the Move VM to dereference invalid pointers during identifier resolution, leading to validator crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Gas metering] Is Symbol creation properly gas-metered in the Move VM, or can an attacker create unlimited Symbols in a single transaction to exhaust memory without paying sufficient gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Deterministic execution] Do all validators create identical Symbol pointer values for the same string, or can non-deterministic pool ordering cause validators to produce different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Transaction replay] When replaying historical transactions, does Symbol creation produce the same pointer values, or can pool state differences cause replay failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deref()] [Parallel execution] In Block-STM parallel transaction execution, can concurrent Symbol dereference cause data races when multiple transactions access the same Symbol simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Move type safety] Can Move bytecode verification be bypassed to create Symbol instances with invalid internal state, breaking type safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Global: SYMBOL_POOL] [VM isolation] If multiple Move VM instances run in the same process, does the global SYMBOL_POOL create isolation issues where VMs can observe each other's symbols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Unicode handling] Does Symbol properly handle all valid Unicode strings including control characters, zero-width characters, and normalization forms that could cause consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: as_str()] [Reference lifetime] Does as_str() return a reference with the correct lifetime, or can it return references that outlive the actual string data in unsafe scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: as_ref()] [Deref coercion] The AsRef<str> implementation deref-coerces to &str - can this create lifetime issues if the coercion interacts badly with other unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Test: test_size] [Binary compatibility] If the size assertion fails on a different platform or Rust version, would this break binary compatibility of serialized blockchain data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Test: test_from_identical_strings_have_the_same_address] [Pool correctness] If this invariant is violated in production due to bugs in pool.insert(), could this cause duplicate entries and memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Test: test_from_different_strings_have_different_addresses] [Collision handling] If hash collisions cause different strings to get the same address, would this break the uniqueness guarantee and cause string confusion bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Send/Sync safety] Is Symbol safe to send between threads and share across threads, or can the raw pointer semantics violate Rust's thread safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Empty string handling] Does Symbol correctly handle empty strings, or can zero-length strings cause special-case bugs in pointer allocation or hash computation? (Low)"
