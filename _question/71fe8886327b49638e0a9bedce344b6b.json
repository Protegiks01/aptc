  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_size_in_group()] [Size Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate individual resource sizes within a group to cause the total group size calculation to underflow, enabling free storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Invariant Violation] Can the backwards compatibility check for resource existence be bypassed by creating resources that exist in storage but return false for resource_exists_in_group(), causing transaction failure instead of proper handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Parallel Execution Bypass] Can resource_exists_in_group() avoid R/W conflicts during parallel execution but still provide incorrect results, leading to INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR when it shouldn't occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Safety Mechanism Bypass] Can attackers exploit the fact that resource group violations cause transaction failure (not blockchain halt) to intentionally fail transactions at specific points for griefing or censorship? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: release_group_cache()] [Memory Leak] Can implementations fail to properly release the cache, causing memory leaks that accumulate over time and lead to validator OOM crashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: release_group_cache()] [Race Condition] If release_group_cache() is called while other threads are still accessing the cache during parallel execution, can this cause use-after-free or data races? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: id()] [Identifier Collision] Can attackers forge or manipulate StateViewId to cause identifier collisions, leading to transactions reading from wrong state versions and causing double-spending? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: read_state_value()] [Error Suppression] Does read_state_value() properly propagate all StateViewError types, or can certain errors be suppressed allowing transactions to proceed without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: read_state_value()] [DoS Attack] Can an attacker craft state_keys that cause read_state_value() to hang or consume excessive resources, allowing them to DoS validator nodes during module writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Usage Manipulation] Can StateStorageUsage be manipulated to report incorrect storage usage, allowing attackers to bypass storage limits or avoid paying correct storage fees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Integer Overflow] Can storage usage counters overflow in get_usage() calculations, wrapping to small values and allowing unlimited storage writes without proper fee payment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Consensus Divergence] If get_usage() returns different values across validators due to storage inconsistencies, can this cause non-deterministic gas charging and consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: TExecutorView] [Trait Composition Attack] Can attackers exploit the combination of TResourceView, TAggregatorV1View, TDelayedFieldView, and StateStorageView to bypass security checks that exist in individual traits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Trait: TExecutorView] [Type Parameter Confusion] Can incorrect type parameter bindings (K, T, L, V) cause type confusion between different view types, leading to unauthorized access or memory corruption? (High)",
