  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [API: Event Queries] [Data Availability] If clients query for events at specific versions, can corrupted EventAccumulatorSchema data cause API errors that make events inaccessible even though they were emitted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Backup: Consistency] [Backup Completeness] When backing up the database, can EventAccumulatorSchema entries be backed up inconsistently with other schemas (like EventSchema), causing restore to produce invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Restore: Validation] [Corrupted Restore] If a restored database has corrupted EventAccumulatorSchema entries, are these detected during validation or can validators use corrupted event accumulator data indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Test: Property Testing] [Encode-Decode Roundtrip] Does the proptest in test.rs cover all edge cases in encode_key()/decode_key() roundtrips, or can fuzzing find inputs that break roundtrip consistency? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Test: Panic Handling] [No-Panic Decoding] Does test_no_panic_decoding! verify that decode operations never panic on malformed input, or can crafted bytes cause validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Monitoring: Error Rates] [Decode Failures] Are decode_key() and decode_value() failures logged and monitored, or can silent corruption in EventAccumulatorSchema go undetected until proof verification fails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Monitoring: Storage Growth] [Accumulator Size] Is the size of EventAccumulatorSchema column family monitored, or can unbounded growth go unnoticed until disk space exhaustion causes validator failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Interaction: EventSchema] [Event-Hash Consistency] Can EventAccumulatorSchema contain hashes for events that don't exist in EventSchema, or vice versa, causing inconsistent state where proofs work but events are missing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Interaction: TransactionInfo] [Version Alignment] Must every Version in EventAccumulatorSchema correspond to a committed transaction in TransactionInfo schema, or can orphaned event accumulators exist causing proof generation for non-existent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Interaction: LedgerInfo] [Ledger Version Bounds] Can EventAccumulatorSchema contain entries for versions beyond the current ledger_version, causing proofs to be generated for uncommitted/speculative events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Replay: Deterministic Rebuild] If the database is rebuilt by replaying transactions, will EventAccumulatorSchema entries be identical to the original, or can non-determinism cause different event hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Replay: Hash Verification] During replay, are event accumulator hashes from EventAccumulatorSchema verified against recomputed values, or can corrupted historical hashes persist undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Performance: Hot Path] [Encode Latency] Can encode_key() become a bottleneck during high-throughput event processing, causing write buffer buildup and memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Performance: Read Amplification] [Proof Construction] When building event proofs, does reading from EventAccumulatorSchema require O(log n) reads per proof, and can this cause excessive I/O that slows down validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Rust: Panic Safety] [Unwrap Safety] Are there any hidden .unwrap() calls in the encoding/decoding path that could panic on unexpected input, causing validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Rust: Memory Safety] [Unsafe Code] Does EventAccumulatorSchema or its dependencies use unsafe code that could have memory safety violations leading to corruption or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event_accumulator/mod.rs] [Rust: Integer Arithmetic] [Arithmetic Overflow] Are all integer arithmetic operations in encode_key() and decode_key() checked or saturating to prevent overflow, or can malicious inputs trigger overflow panics? (High)"
