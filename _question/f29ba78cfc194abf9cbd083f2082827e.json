  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Consensus] [Non-Deterministic Caching] In parallel execution, different validators may cache scripts in different orders due to network timing - can this cause non-deterministic execution where validators use Deserialized vs Verified code differently, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Consensus] [Race Condition Results] Lines 154-162 and 172-181 have race conditions where first-write-wins - can Byzantine validators exploit network timing to ensure their malicious cached scripts win races across the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Consensus] [Cache State Divergence] If different validators have different cache states (some with Verified, some with Deserialized for the same script), can this cause state root divergence even if execution logic is identical? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Determinism] [HashMap Iteration Order] UnsyncScriptCache uses hashbrown::HashMap (line 45) which has non-deterministic iteration order - if cache iteration is ever needed for merkle tree construction or state commitment, can this break determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Memory Safety] [No Unsafe Blocks] The file contains no unsafe code blocks, relying on RefCell and DashMap - but these abstractions can still have bugs, are there any known CVEs in the specific versions of crossbeam, dashmap, or hashbrown dependencies used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Memory Safety] [RefCell Interior Mutability] Line 45 uses RefCell for interior mutability - can this be exploited in async contexts where lifetimes are complex, causing mutable aliasing that violates Rust's safety guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Memory Safety] [Arc Weak References] The code uses Arc but never Weak references - can circular references form if Code objects somehow reference the cache, causing memory leaks that accumulate over validator lifetime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Tests] [Race Condition Tests] Lines 323-354 test multithreaded insert_deserialized but don't verify that all threads see consistent state - can race conditions be missed because tests only check final state, not intermediate consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Tests] [Verification Upgrade Test] Lines 356-386 test verified insertion in multithreaded context, but what if multiple threads insert different verified versions - does the test verify that only one version is cached, preventing divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Tests] [Panic Testing] No tests verify RefCell panic behavior (e.g., lines 77, 93, 112 borrow panics) - can validators crash in production due to untested reentrant access patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Tests] [OOM Testing] No tests verify behavior under memory pressure - if cache grows to gigabytes, do insert operations fail gracefully or cause validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/cache/script_cache.rs] [Tests] [Cache Poisoning] No adversarial tests verify that malicious cached entries can't poison subsequent transactions - should there be fuzzing tests that try to exploit race conditions? (High)"
