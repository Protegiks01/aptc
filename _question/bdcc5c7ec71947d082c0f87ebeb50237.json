  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Signature verification bypass] Are DepositEvent bytes verified with cryptographic signatures before deserialization, or can unsigned events be injected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error information leakage] Does the error returned by try_from_bytes() expose sensitive information about internal validation logic that attackers can exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor validation] Should new(amount) return Result<Self> instead of Self to enable validation, or can invalid DepositEvents be constructed through new()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Default value attack] If DepositEvent implements Default trait, can attackers exploit default values to create uninitialized events with zero amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: amount()] [Getter side effects] Does amount() have any unexpected side effects like logging or metrics collection that could be exploited for DoS through repeated calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor access] Is new(amount) properly restricted to authorized callers, or can any code path create DepositEvents without going through validated deposit functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Public field access] Is the amount field properly private, or can external code directly modify it after construction to falsify deposit amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization privileges] Can untrusted external inputs call try_from_bytes() directly, or should this be restricted to internal system components only? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Schema evolution] If future protocol upgrades add fields to DepositEvent, can old events fail to deserialize or cause type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Static: DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE] [Type migration] During protocol upgrades that change event type definitions, can mismatches between DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE and actual runtime types cause failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Module upgrade safety] If the 'coin' module is upgraded with a different DepositEvent structure, can old Rust code continue using outdated struct definitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Storage bloat] Can attackers emit massive numbers of DepositEvents to bloat event storage and degrade validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Event pruning safety] If old DepositEvents are pruned from storage, can this break invariants that depend on complete event history? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Indexer consistency] Can differences in how try_from_bytes() handles edge cases cause indexers to compute different deposit totals than validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV1Type] [V1/V2 migration] As Aptos transitions from V1 EventHandle-based events to V2 module events, can DepositEvent V1 instances be confused with V2 equivalents causing double-counting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV1Type] [Legacy event handling] Does MoveEventV1Type implementation properly interoperate with modern event systems, or can legacy events bypass new security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Static: DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE] [Event version confusion] Can DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE be matched against both V1 and V2 event types, causing incorrect event parsing and balance calculation errors? (High)"
