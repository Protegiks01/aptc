  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/abstract_write_op.rs] [Struct: ResourceGroupInPlaceDelayedFieldChangeOp] [No layout field] This variant lacks a layout field unlike InPlaceDelayedFieldChangeOp - how are delayed fields materialized without type information?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/abstract_write_op.rs] [Struct: ResourceGroupInPlaceDelayedFieldChangeOp] [materialized_size for groups] Does materialized_size represent the total group size or only the modified portion? Ambiguity here could cause gas miscalculations. (High)",
