  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/ast_debug.rs] [Function: AstWriter::write()] [Margin boundary] When margin approaches usize::MAX, the loop at lines 97-98 (0..margin) could theoretically iterate billions of times - is there a practical upper bound needed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/ast_debug.rs] [Function: display_verbose()] [Wrong constructor] Line 57 calls AstWriter::normal() instead of verbose() - does this bug cause security-relevant verbose information to be omitted from debug output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/ast_debug.rs] [Function: AstWriter::annotate_gen()] [Conditional logic] The verbose checks at lines 135 and 139 control annotation output - can mode confusion between normal and verbose cause critical type information to be hidden during security audits? (Low)",

(High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/ast_debug.rs] [Global] [Resource tracking] Can malformed debug output obscure Move resource ownership violations, allowing contracts with security flaws to pass initial review? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/ast_debug.rs] [Function: AstWriter::write()] [Quadratic complexity] The combination of margin spacing (line 97) and string appending (line 99) for deeply nested structures can cause O(n²) time complexity - can this be exploited for compilation DoS?
