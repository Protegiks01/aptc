  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [Version mismatch] If a node has a version that doesn't match the iterator's version at line 103, should this be detected and rejected, or can it cause incorrect state reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Integration] [Stale data] If the underlying TreeReader returns stale or cached data for some nodes but fresh data for others, can the iterator produce an inconsistent snapshot of state? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/iterator/mod.rs] [Struct: JellyfishMerkleIterator] [Mutable state] The iterator has mutable fields (parent_stack, done) - if accessed concurrently, can this cause data races even without explicit synchronization? (High)",
