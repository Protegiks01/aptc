  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: future_with_permit()] [Panic safety] If the future panics, does the map() closure execute drop(permit), or does panic unwinding skip the permit release causing a leak? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: future_with_permit()] [Move semantics] Is the permit truly moved into the closure, or could there be aliasing issues if the permit implements Copy (it doesn't, but is this enforced)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: function_with_permit()] [Exception safety] If func() calls std::process::abort() or receives a signal, is the permit leaked because drop() never executes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: function_with_permit()] [Double drop] Could there be any scenario where the permit gets dropped twice, causing semaphore corruption and incorrect capacity accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Arc cloning race] When self.semaphore.clone() is called in acquire_permit(), could concurrent clones create race conditions in Arc reference counting during high contention? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Permit acquisition race] If multiple tasks call spawn() concurrently, could semaphore permit acquisition ordering be non-deterministic, causing priority inversion for critical consensus messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [ABA problem] Could there be an ABA problem where a permit is released and immediately reacquired between try_acquire_permit() and the actual spawn, leading to incorrect capacity assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Memory ordering] Are there sufficient memory barriers to ensure permit acquisitions/releases are visible across threads, or could weak memory ordering cause tasks to see stale capacity values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Thundering herd] If many tasks are blocked on acquire_permit() when permits become available, could all tasks wake simultaneously causing CPU spikes and validator performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Task cancellation] If a spawned task is cancelled via JoinHandle::abort(), does future_with_permit's drop guarantee execute, or could cancellation bypass permit release? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Future poll contract] If a future violates the poll contract (e.g., completes after returning Poll::Ready), could this corrupt the permit release mechanism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Thread panic] If the blocking thread panics, does tokio guarantee the closure completes and drops the permit, or could thread panic skip cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: future_with_permit()] [Future resurrection] Could a future be polled again after completion via unsafe code, causing double permit release and semaphore corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Shutdown race] If the tokio runtime shuts down while tasks are spawned but not yet completed, are permits properly released, or leaked causing capacity accounting errors on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: acquire_permit()] [Closed semaphore] Can the semaphore be closed externally, causing acquire_owned() to return Err and trigger the unwrap() panic during critical operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: try_acquire_permit()] [Spurious failures] Could try_acquire_owned() return spurious errors under load, causing legitimate tasks to be rejected and impacting consensus liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [OOM handling] If the system is out of memory during spawn(), could partial permit acquisition leave the executor in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Blocking pool exhaustion] What happens if tokio's blocking thread pool is exhausted separately from semaphore capacity? Does spawn_blocking() block forever causing validator deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Partial failure] If try_acquire_permit() succeeds but executor.spawn() fails internally (e.g., runtime shutdown), is the permit leaked in the Ok() path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: new()] [Capacity overflow] If capacity exceeds the maximum tokio can handle, could this cause silent truncation or incorrect behavior affecting task scheduling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Permit leak accumulation] If there are minor permit leaks over time, could capacity gradually degrade until the executor becomes unusable, causing progressive validator performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Capacity monitoring] Is there any mechanism to monitor current available permits? Could lack of observability hide permit leaks until system failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: new()] [Dynamic resizing] Can capacity be changed after construction? If not, could static capacity limits cause issues during network scaling or validator upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Memory leak via Arc] If BoundedExecutor instances are leaked (never dropped), do the Arc<Semaphore> and Handle keep resources alive indefinitely, causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Priority handling] Does the bounded executor support task priorities? Could low-priority tasks block high-priority consensus operations due to FIFO permit allocation? (High)"
