  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Floating Point] Are there any floating-point operations in the execution path that could produce different results across different CPU architectures, breaking execution determinism? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Random Number Generation] Does the executor service use any randomness that isn't seeded identically across all shards, potentially causing non-deterministic cross-shard communication? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor Panic] Can any of the constructor operations (NetworkController::new, RemoteCoordinatorClient::new) panic, and if so, are resources properly cleaned up or do they leak causing system degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Error Propagation] If the ShardedExecutorService.start() encounters fatal errors, does it propagate them to the caller or silently fail leaving the shard non-functional? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Channel Disconnection] If network channels disconnect mid-execution, does the executor service detect this and fail gracefully or continue attempting to send/receive causing deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Partial Failure] If one shard fails or becomes unresponsive, does the system detect this and trigger reconfiguration, or does it hang waiting for the failed shard indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Parameter Validation] Are num_shards and num_threads validated to be within safe ranges, or can extreme values (0, usize::MAX) cause undefined behavior or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Address Reachability] Does the constructor verify that coordinator_address and remote_shard_addresses are reachable, or can unreachable addresses cause the service to start but fail silently during operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Port Conflicts] Can multiple ExecutorService instances bind to the same self_address causing port conflicts that prevent proper service startup or cause connection routing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Version Compatibility] If different shards are running different versions of the executor service, can protocol incompatibilities cause message parsing failures or execution divergence? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Shard ID Validation] Is shard_id validated to be less than num_shards, or can invalid shard IDs cause array out-of-bounds access in cross-shard message routing? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Transaction Routing] Can transactions be routed to incorrect shards due to shard_id mismatches, causing them to execute with incomplete state and produce wrong results? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Load Balancing] Can an attacker craft transactions that all map to the same shard, creating load imbalance that causes that shard to lag and halt the entire execution pipeline? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Repartitioning] If the number of shards changes dynamically, does the executor service handle repartitioning safely or can it cause state inconsistencies during the transition? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Dependency Deadlock] Can circular cross-shard dependencies cause deadlocks where shards wait on each other indefinitely, halting all execution progress? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Dependency Validation] Are cross-shard state dependencies validated before execution, or can malicious transactions create impossible dependencies that cause execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Starvation] Can one slow or malicious shard hold up execution of transactions on other shards, effectively causing a denial-of-service across the entire sharded executor? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Metric Poisoning] Can malicious messages cause metric counters to overflow or become corrupted, masking actual performance issues or security incidents in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Side Channel] Do execution metrics leak sensitive information about transaction patterns or validator behavior that could be exploited for MEV or other attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Arc Cycles] Can the Arc references between executor_service, coordinator_client, and cross_shard_client form reference cycles preventing proper cleanup and causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Send/Sync Bounds] Are all types properly marked as Send/Sync for safe concurrent access, or can improper bounds cause data races when accessed from multiple threads? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Move Semantics] When executor_service_clone is moved into the thread, are all ownership semantics correct or can there be use-after-move bugs if the original reference is accessed? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [State Root Divergence] Can subtle differences in execution across shards (due to concurrency, ordering, or initialization) cause different shards to compute different state roots, forking the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Transaction Censorship] Can a Byzantine shard selectively drop or refuse to execute certain transactions, enabling censorship without detection by the coordinator? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Execution Delay] Can a malicious shard intentionally slow down execution to cause timeouts in consensus, degrading overall network performance and validator rewards? (Medium)"
