  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization bomb] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with deeply nested or excessively large data structures that cause memory exhaustion during bcs::from_bytes() deserialization, leading to node crashes or DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide BCS bytes that deserialize to a CoinRegister struct with malformed TypeInfoResource data (e.g., invalid module_name or struct_name vectors) that bypass validation in downstream indexer code, causing state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow in deserialization] Can crafted BCS bytes cause integer overflow in Vec<u8> length fields within TypeInfoResource during deserialization, potentially leading to buffer overflows or memory corruption when the indexer processes the event? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic on malformed data] Does the bcs::from_bytes() call properly handle all edge cases, or can specially crafted invalid BCS data cause a panic in the indexer thread, disrupting event processing for the entire blockchain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion via oversized vectors] Can an attacker emit a CoinRegister event with TypeInfoResource containing module_name or struct_name vectors of maximum usize length, causing the indexer to allocate gigabytes of memory and crash during try_from_bytes()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS version compatibility] If the BCS encoding format changes in future versions, can old validator nodes deserialize events from new nodes incorrectly, leading to state divergence where different validators have different views of coin registration events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error propagation vulnerability] Does the anyhow::Error conversion properly sanitize error messages, or can an attacker craft BCS bytes that trigger errors containing sensitive memory addresses or internal state information that gets logged or exposed through APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Determinism violation] Can non-deterministic behavior in bcs::from_bytes() (e.g., due to system-dependent memory layout) cause different validators to deserialize the same event bytes differently, breaking consensus and causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Type confusion attack] Can an attacker emit a CoinRegister event with a TypeInfoResource that references a non-existent or malicious coin type (with crafted account_address, module_name, struct_name), causing the indexer to incorrectly track coin registrations and potentially enabling phantom coin creation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [AccountAddress spoofing] Can the account field be set to an arbitrary address (including system addresses like 0x1) without validation, allowing an attacker to emit fake coin registration events that make it appear as though privileged accounts registered malicious coin types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Module name injection] Can TypeInfoResource.module_name contain arbitrary bytes (including null bytes, special characters, or non-UTF8 sequences) that cause SQL injection, path traversal, or other vulnerabilities when the indexer stores this data in its database? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Struct name overflow] Can TypeInfoResource.struct_name be an empty vector or contain invalid UTF-8 that causes indexer queries to fail or return incorrect results when users query registered coin types by name? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Account address collision] If two CoinRegister events are emitted with the same account address but different type_info values, does the indexer properly handle this case, or can it lead to data corruption where one coin registration overwrites another? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Type parameter manipulation] Since TypeInfoResource includes type parameters in struct_name, can an attacker craft a CoinRegister with malformed type parameters (e.g., recursive generics like 'CoinType<CoinType<CoinType<...>>>') that cause infinite loops or stack overflows in type validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] The MODULE_NAME constant is set to 'account', but can an attacker exploit discrepancies between this Rust constant and the actual Move module name to cause type confusion when the event is deserialized in different contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name collision] Since STRUCT_NAME is 'CoinRegister', can a malicious smart contract deploy another struct with the same name in a different module to create ambiguity in event type resolution, potentially allowing event spoofing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Hardcoded string vulnerability] The use of ident_str! macro for MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME creates compile-time constants, but if the Move framework is upgraded to rename these identifiers, will old validator nodes continue to deserialize events correctly or will this cause a consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event creation vulnerability] The empty trait implementation delegates to create_event_v2() which uses BCS serialization - can an attacker exploit race conditions between event creation and emission to modify the CoinRegister struct fields after serialization but before the event is committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Type tag manipulation] When create_event_v2() constructs the TypeTag using Self::struct_tag(), can an attacker craft a situation where the type tag doesn't match the actual event data, causing indexers to misclassify events and leading to incorrect coin registration tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Serialization non-determinism] If the Serialize trait implementation for CoinRegister or TypeInfoResource has non-deterministic behavior (e.g., HashMap ordering), can different validators produce different event data bytes for the same logical event, breaking state commitment integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] The Lazy::new() pattern for COIN_REGISTER_TYPE may not be thread-safe in all contexts - can concurrent first-time accesses from multiple threads cause race conditions that result in multiple TypeTag instances being created with different memory layouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [CORE_CODE_ADDRESS tampering] The TypeTag uses CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (0x1), but can an attacker exploit any scenario where this constant is overridden or shadowed to create fake CoinRegister events that appear to come from the core framework? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [Empty type_args vulnerability] The type_args vector is empty, but should CoinRegister be generic over the coin type being registered? Does this omission allow an attacker to register multiple different coin types with indistinguishable events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [StructTag boxing overhead] The Box<StructTag> allocation in COIN_REGISTER_TYPE happens at runtime - can an attacker trigger excessive allocations by querying this static repeatedly, potentially causing memory fragmentation or performance degradation in indexer nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: account()] [Reference lifetime exploitation] The method returns &AccountAddress - can an attacker exploit lifetime extension bugs where the reference outlives the CoinRegister struct, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities in unsafe code that processes the event?
