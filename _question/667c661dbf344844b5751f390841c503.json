  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Network: Peer reputation] Does the data client track which peers provided accurate vs inaccurate GlobalDataSummary data, or can Byzantine peers repeatedly lie without consequence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Network: Bandwidth amplification] Can malicious peers advertise GlobalDataSummary that causes victims to make many expensive data requests, amplifying bandwidth consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Network: Gossip propagation] If GlobalDataSummary is gossiped through the network, can malicious data be amplified through honest peers before being validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Lifecycle: Initialization race] During node startup, can there be a race between initializing with empty() and receiving real advertised data, causing requests to be made with invalid/empty summaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Lifecycle: Update atomicity] When updating GlobalDataSummary with new data from peers, is the update atomic, or can partial updates leave the structure in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Lifecycle: Pruning coordination] When nodes prune historical data and update their advertised ranges, can lack of coordination cause network-wide data unavailability for certain version ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Arithmetic: Range size calculation] If code calculates range sizes as (highest - lowest), can underflow occur when lowest > highest, or overflow when the difference exceeds u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Arithmetic: Chunk size multiplication] When calculating total data size as chunk_size * num_chunks, can overflow cause incorrect resource allocation or validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Arithmetic: Version increment] When computing next version as version + 1, can overflow at Version::MAX cause wrapping to 0, breaking synchronization continuity?
