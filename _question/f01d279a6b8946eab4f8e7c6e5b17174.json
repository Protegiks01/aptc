  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Graceful Shutdown] If the validator is shutting down, can the FileStream be interrupted cleanly or will it continue polling the file system indefinitely blocking shutdown? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Empty File Handling] Does load_file() properly handle completely empty files (0 bytes), or does this cause YAML parsing errors that disrupt peer discovery? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [BOM Handling] Can UTF-8 byte order marks (BOM) at the start of the YAML file cause parsing errors or be exploited to hide malicious content? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [File System Mount Attacks] If the file_path is on a remotely mounted filesystem (NFS, CIFS) that becomes unavailable, does this cause permanent discovery failures or can the system recover when the mount is restored? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Duplicate PeerID] Can the YAML file contain duplicate PeerIds that cause HashMap collisions or undefined behavior in connectivity management? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Peer Address Multiplicity] Can a single peer have conflicting network addresses (multiple IPs for same PeerId) that cause connection confusion or connection pool exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [HashSet Validation] Are the keys HashSet in Peer properly validated for uniqueness and format, or can duplicate keys cause issues in peer authentication? (Low)"
