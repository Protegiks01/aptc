  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Cryptographic key reuse] The WARNING comment states encryption keys will be reused which 'might not be safe' - can a malicious validator exploit the duplicated encryption keys in to_weighted_encryption_keys() to break semantic security, decrypt other players' shares, or forge shares leading to compromised DKG secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Key material exposure] When duplicating encryption keys based on weights, does the reuse of the same EncryptPubKey for multiple virtual players create a chosen-ciphertext attack surface where an attacker with access to decryption oracles can recover the underlying secret shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Cryptographic malleability] Can an attacker exploit the fact that multiple shares are encrypted under the same key to perform malleability attacks, modifying encrypted shares in transit to corrupt the final reconstructed secret without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Key correlation attack] Since duplicated_eks reuses the same encryption key for each player's multiple shares, can an adversary perform correlation analysis across the multiple encrypted shares to statistically infer information about the secret or other players' shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Integer overflow] In Vec::with_capacity(sc.get_total_weight()), if get_total_weight() returns a value close to usize::MAX, can this cause integer overflow during allocation leading to memory corruption or panic that disrupts the DKG ceremony? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [DoS via excessive weights] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate their weight value to cause get_total_weight() to return an enormous value, leading to OOM (out of memory) when allocating duplicated_eks vector, causing validator nodes to crash and disrupting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Weight manipulation] If sc.get_player_weight(player) returns zero or an extremely large value due to corrupted WeightedConfig, can this cause the loop to skip share generation or allocate excessive memory, breaking threshold reconstruction requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Weight inconsistency attack] Can an attacker provide different weight values during dealing vs decryption, causing the number of shares generated to mismatch the number expected during reconstruction, leading to DKG protocol failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_weighted_encryption_keys()] [Weight sum overflow] In the loop pushing ek.clone() num_shares times, if multiple players have large weights, can their sum overflow during iteration causing an incorrect number of encryption keys to be generated, breaking threshold requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Virtual player collision] Does get_virtual_player(player, i) guarantee unique virtual player IDs across all players and indices, or can hash collisions cause multiple physical players to map to the same virtual player, allowing share theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Virtual player manipulation] Can a malicious player manipulate the virtual player mapping by providing crafted player IDs that collide with other validators' virtual players, allowing them to decrypt shares not intended for them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Index out of bounds] If the loop iterates 0..weight but get_virtual_player() expects indices in a different range, can this cause index out of bounds panics or incorrect virtual player selection leading to share misallocation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Determinism violation] Is get_virtual_player() deterministic across all nodes, or can non-deterministic behavior cause different nodes to decrypt different shares for the same player, breaking DKG consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization bypass] The to_bytes() method directly delegates to self.trx.to_bytes() without adding any weighted-specific metadata - can an attacker deserialize a weighted transcript as an unweighted one to bypass weight-based threshold checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Deserialization confusion] The try_from() implementation doesn't verify that the deserialized transcript is actually compatible with weighted schemes - can an adversary craft malformed bytes that deserialize successfully but violate weighted PVSS invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Type confusion attack] Since ValidCryptoMaterial is implemented directly on GenericWeighting but serialization goes through the inner trx, can type confusion during deserialization cause a weighted transcript to be treated as unweighted, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Struct: GenericWeighting] [Missing validation] The struct derives Deserialize but there's no validation in try_from() to ensure the inner trx is valid for the weighted scheme - can malicious data be deserialized to create invalid transcript states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Verification bypass] The verify() function duplicates encryption keys but passes sc.get_threshold_config() instead of the full weighted config - can this allow transcripts that are invalid under weighted thresholds to pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Weight-threshold mismatch] When calling T::verify() with sc.get_threshold_config(), does the unweighted threshold match the weighted threshold requirement, or can this allow acceptance of transcripts with insufficient weighted shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature validation bypass] Does the underlying T::verify() properly validate all signatures when keys are duplicated, or can an attacker reuse one valid signature across multiple virtual players to reduce the effective verification threshold? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Missing dealer validation] The deal() function accepts a dealer parameter but doesn't validate if the dealer is authorized or has sufficient weight - can any node claim to be a dealer and generate malicious transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Inconsistent auxiliary data] The aux parameter is passed to verification but its relationship to weights isn't validated - can an attacker provide mismatched aux data that passes verification but causes incorrect weight interpretation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Aggregation threshold bypass] When aggregating transcripts, does the function verify that the combined transcript maintains the weighted threshold requirement, or can an attacker aggregate insufficient shares to break threshold security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Weight consistency check] During aggregation, is there validation that both transcripts use the same weight configuration, or can mixing transcripts with different weights cause threshold violations or share corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Double aggregation attack] Can a malicious validator aggregate the same transcript multiple times to artificially inflate their effective weight, allowing them to reconstruct the secret with fewer legitimate shares?
