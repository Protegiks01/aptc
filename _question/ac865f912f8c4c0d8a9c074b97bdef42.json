  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Can an attacker exploit the constructor by passing a malicious listen_addr that conflicts with existing validators, causing message routing confusion and potential consensus message interception? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the constructor validate the service string length, or can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by registering handlers with extremely long service names consuming validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Struct: OutboundHandler] [State consistency] Can the empty HashSet for remote_addresses and empty Vec for handlers lead to undefined behavior if start() is called before any handlers are registered? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Access control] Can a malicious node register multiple handlers for the same remote_addr with different message types, causing message routing conflicts and potential consensus message loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Input validation] Does register_handler() validate that message_type is not empty or contains special characters that could exploit downstream parsing logic in MessageType::new()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call register_handler() without bounds checking to exhaust memory by growing the handlers Vec indefinitely, causing validator OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Duplicate registration] Can the same remote_addr be inserted into remote_addresses HashSet multiple times with different receivers, leading to race conditions in GRPC client creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Handler ordering] Does the order of handler registration in the Vec affect message priority during Select operations, potentially allowing priority manipulation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Receiver validation] Can a disconnected or closed Receiver be registered, causing the Select operation to fail immediately when start() is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Early return] Can an attacker exploit the early return when handlers.is_empty() to prevent outbound message processing, causing consensus messages to never be sent and breaking liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Stop signal injection] Can an attacker inject messages into the stop_signal_rx channel before start() completes, causing premature task termination and loss of network connectivity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [GRPC client creation] Does the GRPC client creation loop validate that remote_addr is reachable before insertion, or can unreachable addresses cause the handler to block indefinitely on first message send? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [mem::take() race] Can concurrent access to self.handlers during mem::take() cause race conditions if register_handler() is called from another thread after start() begins? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Runtime panic] If the Runtime rt passed to start() is shutting down, can the spawn() call panic or silently fail, leaving the outbound handler in a non-functional state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Stop signal position] Can the stop_signal_rx being pushed to the end of handlers Vec cause Select to prioritize other receivers, preventing graceful shutdown when the signal is sent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Clone overhead] Does cloning inbound_handler Arc<Mutex<>> multiple times create reference count overflow potential in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [HashMap initialization] Can the HashMap::new() for grpc_clients fail to allocate memory under resource pressure, causing a panic in the foreach loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Remote address iteration] Does iterating remote_addresses in unspecified order cause non-deterministic GRPC client creation, potentially causing validator state divergence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Return value handling] Can the Option<Sender<Message>> return value be dropped without calling send(), leaving the outbound task running indefinitely without a way to stop it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Infinite loop] Can the infinite loop in process_one_outgoing_message() consume excessive CPU if messages are sent faster than they can be processed, causing validator performance degradation? (High)",
