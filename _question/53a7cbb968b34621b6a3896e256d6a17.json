  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Aggregation consistency] When PVSS transcripts are aggregated, do all resulting dealt public keys properly combine through group operations, or could attackers craft transcripts with dealt keys that don't aggregate correctly, breaking threshold reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Unsafe group operations] Could external code using as_group_element() perform invalid group operations (e.g., division, inversion of identity) that corrupt the dealt public key and break PVSS security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Transcript verification bypass] Since DealtPubKey doesn't contain any proof or signature, can an attacker substitute arbitrary dealt public keys in transcripts without detection, allowing them to control the final DKG output? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Multi-transcript consistency] When comparing dealt public keys from multiple transcripts (main vs fast PVSS), does the Eq implementation correctly identify inconsistent dealt keys that indicate transcript manipulation? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Array size validation] Does to_compressed() guarantee to always return exactly DEALT_PK_NUM_BYTES, or could mismatches between the constant and actual return size cause memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Slice bounds] Could the slice casting in try_from cause out-of-bounds reads if the bytes slice is part of a larger buffer with arbitrary data following it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Drop implementation] Is there a proper Drop implementation to securely zero out the group element in memory when DealtPubKey is deallocated, or could dealt key material remain in memory? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Error context] Does CryptoMaterialError provide sufficient context to distinguish between different failure modes (wrong length, invalid encoding, wrong subgroup), or could error ambiguity hide attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Panic safety] Could any code path in g2_proj_from_bytes or the slice conversion panic instead of returning an error, causing validator crashes when processing malicious transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [to_bytes() infallibility] Since ValidCryptoMaterial::to_bytes() returns Vec<u8> without Result, could this hide serialization failures that should be errors, leading to silent data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Thread safety] Is GTProjective thread-safe for concurrent reads via as_group_element(), or could multiple threads accessing the same DealtPubKey cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Send/Sync bounds] Does DealtPubKey properly implement Send and Sync traits, and could incorrect bounds allow unsafe concurrent access to group elements across validator threads? (High)",
