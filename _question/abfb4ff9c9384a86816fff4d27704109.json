  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: get_lint_skips()] [Global environment trust] The target.global_env() (line 83) and target.module_env().get_attributes() (line 84) retrieve environment data - can attackers manipulate the GlobalEnv to provide false attribute data that bypasses security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: get_lint_skips()] [Function environment access] The target.func_env.get_attributes() on line 89 accesses function attributes - if func_env is uninitialized or corrupted, can this cause undefined behavior or return attacker-controlled skip lists? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: get_lint_skips()] [String comparison] Skip names are compared as Strings in BTreeSet - can attackers exploit Unicode equivalence or normalization issues to create skip directives that appear different but match security checker names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: get_lint_skips()] [Memory exhaustion] If malicious attributes contain extremely long lists of skip directives, can the BTreeSet allocation on line 92 cause excessive memory consumption or OOM during compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: get_lint_skips()] [Immutability assumption] The function assumes attributes are immutable during execution - can concurrent modification of module or function attributes lead to inconsistent skip sets between the two lint_skips_from_attributes() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Struct: LintProcessor] [State management] The LintProcessor struct is empty (line 21) and stateless - does this mean lint state is not preserved between process() calls, potentially allowing attackers to cause inconsistent validation across different functions in the same module? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Function: name()] [Name collision] The processor name 'LintProcessor' (line 46) is used for identification - can multiple instances or name collisions with other processors cause the wrong processor to be invoked or skipped in the pipeline? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Trait: FunctionTargetProcessor] [Interface contract] LintProcessor implements FunctionTargetProcessor - if other methods like initialize(), finalize(), or is_single_run() are not overridden, could default implementations cause security checks to be skipped or executed incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Struct: LintProcessor] [Instantiation] With an empty struct, multiple LintProcessor instances could exist - can race conditions between concurrent processor instances operating on shared FunctionTargetsHolder cause lint checks to be skipped or duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: external_checks] [Malicious trait implementation] The StacklessBytecodeChecker trait from external_checks.rs (line 9) allows external implementations - can attackers provide checkers that exploit the check() interface to access sensitive compiler internals or corrupt compilation state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: lint_common] [Parsing vulnerability] The lint_skips_from_attributes function (line 10) is imported from lint_common - if this function has vulnerabilities in attribute AST parsing, can malformed attributes cause crashes, infinite loops, or code injection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: Options] [Configuration injection] The Options struct (line 11) controls external_checks - if Options can be manipulated through command-line arguments or config files, can attackers inject malicious checker implementations that execute arbitrary code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: FunctionTarget] [Data integrity] FunctionTarget (line 15) wraps FunctionData - if the target construction or data access has bugs, can this lead to checkers operating on incorrect bytecode, missing security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: FunctionTargetsHolder] [Shared state] FunctionTargetsHolder (line 16) is passed as mutable reference - if multiple processors access it concurrently without proper synchronization, can race conditions corrupt the holder's internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Import: BTreeSet] [Hash collision] BTreeSet (line 18) is used for skip name comparisons - can attackers craft checker names that cause hash collisions or comparison issues, leading to incorrect skip set membership tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: Early returns] [Coverage gap] The process() method has two early return paths (lines 32, 36) before checker execution - can attackers craft modules where most functions trigger early returns, effectively bypassing the majority of security linting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: Filter chain] [Short-circuit vulnerability] The filter operation (line 72) short-circuits on first skip match - if skip names are ordered maliciously, can this cause certain checkers to incorrectly pass through the filter? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: Checker iteration] [Partial execution] If a checker panics mid-execution (line 40), are remaining checkers in the pipeline skipped, potentially missing critical security issues in the same function? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: Empty vector] [Silent failure] When external_checks is empty or all checkers are filtered out, an empty vec is returned (line 61, 74) - does this fail silently without warning, allowing vulnerable code to pass through unvalidated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: is_native check] [False positive] The is_native() check (line 31) exempts native functions - can attackers mark malicious wrapper functions as native to bypass linting while still executing dangerous user code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Logic: is_primary_target] [Scope limitation] Only primary targets are linted (line 35) - can attackers hide malicious logic in non-primary modules that still get compiled and executed on-chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Memory: Box allocation] [Heap exhaustion] Each checker is boxed (get_stackless_bytecode_checkers returns Vec<Box<dyn>>) - can extremely large numbers of checkers cause heap exhaustion during pipeline construction?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Memory: FunctionTarget lifetime] [Dangling reference] FunctionTarget borrows from data (line 34) - if checkers store references to target beyond check() execution, can this create dangling pointers when data is moved? (High)",
