  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Friend function abuse] The swap function in mem.move is marked as 'friend' and only accessible by std::vector, std::option - can an attacker bypass this restriction through bytecode manipulation or by exploiting module system vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Module upgrade attack] If the std::mem module is upgraded via governance, can an attacker exploit the upgrade window to call native_swap with old assumptions that are no longer valid in the new version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Cross-contract reentrancy] Can native_swap be used in a reentrancy attack where swapping a value triggers event handlers or hooks that re-enter native_swap, causing stack overflow or logic errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Spec violation - aborts_if false] The Move specification states 'aborts_if false' for swap, but the Rust implementation can abort with EFEATURE_NOT_ENABLED - does this specification mismatch enable verification bypass or formal verification false negatives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Spec violation - ensures clause] The spec guarantees 'ensures right == old(left) && left == old(right)', but can an attacker exploit error paths or exceptions where swap_values fails mid-operation, violating this postcondition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Opaque pragma abuse] The spec uses 'pragma opaque' meaning callers can't see implementation details - can an attacker exploit this opacity to make assumptions about swap behavior that don't hold, causing logic errors in dependent code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Resource duplication] Can an attacker use swap to duplicate Move resources (coins, NFTs) by exploiting reference semantics, creating multiple instances of unique resources and causing inflation or double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Resource destruction] If swap is used on resources with drop restrictions, can an attacker bypass drop handlers and destroy resources without proper cleanup, leaking locked funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Linear type violation] Move's linear type system prevents copying resources - can native_swap be exploited to create copies during the swap operation, violating linearity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Atomic swap bypass] Can an attacker use native_swap to bypass atomic swap protocols in DeFi contracts, executing partial swaps or front-running swap operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Oracle manipulation] Can native_swap be used to manipulate oracle price feeds by swapping price data at critical moments, causing dependent DeFi protocols to malfunction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Governance vote manipulation] Can an attacker use swap to manipulate voting power or proposal state during governance operations, changing vote outcomes or bypassing quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Vector index confusion] When swapping vector elements (IndexedRef), can an attacker exploit the idx field to swap elements across different vectors with matching indices, causing cross-vector contamination? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Vector capacity manipulation] Can swapping large vector elements trigger capacity changes or reallocations that cause memory corruption or invalidate other references to the same vector? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Specialized vector type confusion] The swap implementation handles specialized vectors (VecU8, VecU64, etc.) differently - can an attacker exploit type confusion between specialized and generic vectors during swaps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Transaction ordering attack] Can an attacker manipulate transaction ordering to ensure their swap executes before or after other transactions, enabling front-running or sandwich attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Parallel execution conflict] In Block-STM parallel execution, can swap operations on the same data create read-write conflicts that cause unnecessary transaction aborts, degrading throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Execution context pollution] Does native_swap properly isolate its execution context, or can side effects (modified gas counter, error state) leak into subsequent native function calls in the same transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Generic type erasure] When handling generic references, does type information properly flow through the swap operation, or can type erasure cause loss of type safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Phantom type confusion] If references contain phantom type parameters, can an attacker exploit phantom types to bypass type checks while maintaining type system consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Ability constraint bypass] Move types have abilities (copy, drop, store, key) - can native_swap be used to bypass ability constraints, such as copying non-copyable types or storing non-storable types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Struct field reordering] When swapping struct references, are field orderings properly maintained, or can an attacker exploit field position assumptions to corrupt struct layouts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/mem.rs] [Function: native_swap()] [Container len() inconsistency] The swap operation uses container.len() for validation - can an attacker manipulate length metadata to bypass bounds checks or cause index mismatches? (High)",
