  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft a transaction with Version or Index values near u64::MAX that cause integer overflow during BigEndian encoding, potentially creating key collisions that overwrite critical events from other transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Key collision] If multiple transactions produce events with identical (Version, Index) pairs due to concurrent execution or state machine errors, can the later event silently overwrite the earlier one, causing permanent loss of critical governance/staking events without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Determinism violation] Does encode_key() produce bit-identical output across different validator nodes with different endianness or architecture, or can encoding variations cause validators to store events at different keys, breaking state consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Buffer allocation] Can an attacker trigger a transaction that generates events causing encode_key() to allocate excessive memory via Vec::with_capacity(), leading to OOM crashes on validator nodes during block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Slice length validation] If ensure_slice_len_eq() fails due to corrupted database data or malicious backup restoration, does decode_key() handle the error gracefully, or can it cause validator crashes during event queries, leading to API unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Panic on invalid data] Can a malicious actor who gains write access to RocksDB directly insert event keys with invalid byte lengths (e.g., 15 bytes instead of 16), causing decode_key() to panic during iteration and crash the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [BigEndian parsing] If the input slice contains non-UTF-8 or corrupted bytes, can read_u64::<BigEndian>() return inconsistent Version or Index values across validators, causing them to retrieve different events for the same query? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Integer wrapping] When decoding Version and Index from bytes, can malicious byte sequences cause silent integer wrapping that maps different logical keys to the same physical key, enabling event substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [BCS bomb] Can an attacker craft a ContractEvent with deeply nested TypeTag structures that explode in size during BCS serialization via bcs::to_bytes(), causing memory exhaustion and validator node crashes during event emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Determinism violation] If ContractEvent contains floating-point numbers or non-deterministic fields, can bcs::to_bytes() produce different byte sequences across validators, causing state root mismatches and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Size limit bypass] Does encode_value() enforce any maximum size limit on the encoded ContractEvent, or can an attacker emit events with multi-gigabyte event_data fields that bloat the database and cause storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Error handling] If bcs::to_bytes() fails due to serialization errors (e.g., invalid type tags), does the error propagate correctly, or can it be silently ignored, leading to events being omitted from storage without transaction failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [BCS deserialization attack] Can an attacker inject malicious byte sequences into the database that cause bcs::from_bytes() to produce valid but semantically incorrect ContractEvent objects, enabling event substitution or fake event injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Panic on malformed data] If decode_value() receives truncated or corrupted BCS data during database iteration, can bcs::from_bytes() panic instead of returning an error, crashing the validator during event queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Type confusion] Can malicious BCS data cause decode_value() to deserialize a ContractEventV1 as ContractEventV2 or vice versa, bypassing event key validation and enabling replay attacks with modified sequence numbers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Integer overflow in event_data] If the decoded ContractEvent contains event_data with lengths exceeding available memory, can the deserialization trigger OOM conditions that crash validator nodes during state synchronization?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_seek_key()] [Range query manipulation] Can an attacker craft a Version value that causes encode_seek_key() to produce a seek key that skips over critical events (e.g., governance proposals or staking rewards), enabling censorship of event data via API queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_seek_key()] [Key ordering violation] Does encode_seek_key() using to_be_bytes() guarantee the same lexicographic ordering as encode_key() with BigEndian, or can ordering mismatches cause range queries to return events in incorrect sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_seek_key()] [Incomplete seek] If encode_seek_key() only encodes Version without Index, can range queries accidentally retrieve events from adjacent versions, causing API responses to leak events from private transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_seek_key()] [Endianness inconsistency] Can differences in byte ordering between encode_seek_key() (to_be_bytes()) and encode_key() (BigEndian) cause seek operations to land at incorrect database positions, breaking event iteration?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Atomic write failure] If a transaction emits multiple events but the database batch commit fails partially, can some events be persisted while others are lost, violating atomicity and causing inconsistent event logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Concurrent write race] Can concurrent writes to EventSchema from parallel transaction execution cause events to be interleaved incorrectly, resulting in Index values that don't monotonically increase within a transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Type: Key] [Tuple ordering] Does the Key type alias (Version, Index) maintain the correct ordering semantics for range queries, or can tuple comparison rules cause events to be retrieved in non-chronological order? (Medium)",
