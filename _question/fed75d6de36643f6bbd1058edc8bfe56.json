  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Event emission DOS] Does the event module registration (line 83) enforce limits on event emissions per transaction, or can malicious code emit unlimited events causing validator storage exhaustion? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Code deployment bypass] Can the code module natives (line 82) be exploited to deploy bytecode without proper verification, publisher authentication, or compatibility checks, enabling malicious module installation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Object code deployment privilege escalation] Does the object_code_deployment module (line 19 declaration) properly restrict code deployment to object owners, or can attackers inject malicious code into objects they don't own?

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Randomness prediction] Does the randomness module registration (line 73) ensure that native randomness sources are unpredictable and unbiasable by validators, or can malicious validators manipulate random values to their advantage in leader election or lottery contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Consensus config manipulation] Can the consensus_config module (line 91) natives be exploited to modify consensus parameters during execution, causing validators to fork or violating safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Dispatchable fungible asset bypass] Can the dispatchable_fungible_asset module (lines 93-96) be exploited to bypass custom transfer logic or hooks registered by asset creators, enabling unauthorized transfers or double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Hash collision exploitation] Does the aptos_hash module registration (line 65) include collision-resistant hash functions, or can attackers find collisions in Merkle tree hashing to forge state proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [BCS deserialization exploit] The util module is registered as both 'util' (line 71) and 'from_bcs' (line 72) - can this dual registration be exploited to cause different deserialization behavior, leading to non-deterministic execution across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [String utils buffer overflow] Can the string_utils module (line 90) natives be exploited with crafted UTF-8 sequences to cause buffer overflows or memory corruption in string manipulation operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Debug natives in production] Does the debug module registration (line 89) expose dangerous debugging natives in production builds that could leak sensitive information or bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Macro: add_natives_from_module!] [Macro hygiene violation] Can the macro at lines 49-55 be exploited through carefully crafted module names containing special characters or escape sequences to inject arbitrary code or cause compilation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Macro: add_natives_from_module!] [String conversion safety] Does the .to_string() call in the macro (line 52) handle all module name edge cases safely, or can extremely long names cause stack overflow or heap exhaustion? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: status] [Error code collision] The status module defines NFE_EXPECTED_STRUCT_TYPE_TAG (0x1) and NFE_UNABLE_TO_PARSE_ADDRESS (0x2) - can these error codes conflict with error codes from other modules, causing ambiguous error handling and security bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Module: status] [Error code exhaustion] Are error codes properly namespaced and limited, or can malicious code define overlapping error codes that mask critical failures and enable silent exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Genesis module impersonation] The 'genesis' module (line 61) reuses create_signer::make_all - can attackers exploit this to call genesis-only functions after genesis has completed, bypassing initialization guards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Module ordering dependency] Are there implicit dependencies between native modules where one module's natives must be registered before another, and can reordering cause security violations? (Medium)",
