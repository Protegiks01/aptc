(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: rewrite_call() - Operation::Vector] [Empty Vector Optimization] The comment says empty vector creation is less gas than ld_const_base - can this optimization cause semantic differences where empty constant vectors behave differently than runtime empty vectors? (Medium)",
