  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/metrics.rs] [Lines: 12] [Metric Naming] Does the metric name 'indexer_grpc_cache_worker_errors' follow Prometheus naming conventions and avoid conflicts with other Aptos components that might use similar names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/metrics.rs] [Lines: 22] [Metric Naming] Is 'indexer_grpc_cache_worker_wait_for_file_store_counter' unique enough to avoid collisions with file-store-worker or other indexer components in shared Prometheus instances? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/metrics.rs] [Lines: 10-17] [Metric Collection Failure] If the Prometheus client encounters errors during metric collection (e.g., network issues), are these silently ignored or do they cascade to cache worker failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/metrics.rs] [Entire File] [Fallback Behavior] If metrics initialization fails, is there a fallback to log-based error tracking, or does the cache worker become completely unobservable? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/metrics.rs] [Lines: 10-17] [Label Length] Are error_type label values length-limited to prevent excessively long labels that could cause buffer overflows or memory issues in the Prometheus client? (Low)",
