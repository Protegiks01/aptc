  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Error Handling: RootPath::new()] When parent() returns None for root paths, the fallback to empty PathBuf could cause panics or undefined behavior downstream - are all callers prepared to handle empty root paths safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Error Handling: get_config_name()] The unwrap_or('UnknownConfig') silently handles errors - can this mask configuration issues where critical configs are not loaded but the validator continues with unsafe defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Edge Case: Unicode Paths] Are all functions properly tested with non-ASCII Unicode paths, or can Unicode normalization issues cause path mismatches or security bypasses on international validator deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Edge Case: Very Long Paths] Can extremely long paths (near OS limits of 4096 bytes) cause buffer issues, panics, or truncation in path operations affecting config loading reliability? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Edge Case: Special Filenames] Are special Windows filenames (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1) handled correctly, or can they cause validators to hang or fail when used in config paths? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Rust Safety: PathBuf Cloning] Are PathBuf clones in full_path() properly optimized to avoid memory issues, or can repeated cloning of large paths cause memory exhaustion in validators processing many configs? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Rust Safety: AsRef<Path> Conversion] Can the AsRef<Path> trait implementation in new() and new_path() be exploited with unexpected types that bypass intended path validation? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Rust Safety: String Splitting] In get_config_name(), does the split('::') operation on type_name() handle all possible Rust type representations correctly, or can exotic types (closures, async blocks) produce unexpected names? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Config Injection: Environment Variables] If config paths are derived from environment variables before being passed to RootPath, can attackers with environment control inject malicious paths to load attacker-controlled configs? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Config Injection: Command Line Args] Can command-line arguments containing path traversal sequences be passed to RootPath constructors without sanitization, allowing operators to accidentally misconfigure validators with unsafe paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Config Injection: YAML Parsing] If config file paths are read from YAML/TOML configs before validation, can recursive config loading be exploited to inject malicious paths through nested config references? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Determinism: Path Ordering] Does the file system traversal order or path resolution depend on filesystem metadata that could differ across validators, breaking consensus determinism? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Determinism: Timestamp Dependencies] Do any path operations (stat, readlink) depend on file timestamps or other non-deterministic metadata that could cause validators to make different config loading decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Determinism: Locale Dependencies] Can locale-specific path case sensitivity or Unicode handling cause validators in different regions to resolve paths differently, breaking global consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Attack: Config Shadowing] Can attackers place malicious config files earlier in path resolution order to shadow legitimate configs, causing validators to load attacker-controlled settings? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Attack: Filesystem Monitoring] Do path operations leave traces in filesystem audit logs that attackers can monitor to infer validator internal state or configuration structure? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Attack: Timing Side-Channel] Can the execution time of full_path() operations leak information about path structure or filesystem layout to timing-based attacks? (Low)"
