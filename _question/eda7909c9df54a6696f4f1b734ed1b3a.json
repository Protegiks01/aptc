  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Concurrency] [ModuleBuilder Mutation] The ModuleBuilder is passed as &mut throughout - can concurrent calls to process_intrinsic_declaration() from different threads cause data races in the builder's internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Concurrency] [GlobalEnv Shared Access] GlobalEnv is accessed throughout (get_function, get_module, get_spec_fun) - are these accesses properly synchronized if GlobalEnv is shared across threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Concurrency] [BTreeMap Non-Atomic Operations] All BTreeMap insert/get operations are non-atomic - can interleaved operations from concurrent intrinsic processing corrupt the maps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Concurrency] [IntrinsicsAnnotation Mutation] add_decl() mutates multiple fields - is IntrinsicsAnnotation protected by locks when accessed from multiple threads during parallel compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Error Handling] [Partial Failure State] When builder.parent.error() is called (lines 90, 107, 149, 159, 180, 197, 210, 223, 239), processing continues with 'return' or 'continue' - can accumulated error state cause inconsistencies if not properly cleared? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Message Information Leakage] Error messages include qualified symbol names (lines 163, 184, 200, 214, 225, 244) - do these leak sensitive information about internal module structure that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Validation] [No Intrinsic Count Limit] There's no limit on how many intrinsics can be registered per struct or globally - can this be exploited for resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Validation] [No Function Signature Validation] The critical TODOs at lines 190-192 and 232-234 note missing signature type checking - can functions with wrong return types, parameter counts, or parameter types be mapped as intrinsics, causing runtime type errors or security vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Validation] [No Visibility Checks] There's no validation that mapped functions are public or have correct visibility - can private functions be exposed as intrinsics, breaking encapsulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Validation] [No Reentrancy Checks] If intrinsic functions can call back into the intrinsic system, can this cause reentrancy issues during declaration processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Type System] [QualifiedId Type Confusion] QualifiedId is generic over StructId, FunId, and SpecFunId - can type confusion occur if a QualifiedId<StructId> is cast or coerced to QualifiedId<FunId>? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Type System] [Module ID Validation] QualifiedId contains a module_id - is this validated to ensure intrinsics only reference modules that are properly loaded and verified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Move Semantics] [Resource Type Intrinsics] If an intrinsic is declared for a Move resource type, can operations on the intrinsic violate Move's resource safety guarantees (no copy, no drop)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Move Semantics] [Generic Type Handling] The code doesn't show handling of generic type parameters - can intrinsics be declared for generic types in ways that violate type parameter constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Intrinsic Name] What happens if intrinsic_name is an empty string in the is_intrinsic_of_* functions? Can this match any intrinsic due to symbol pool behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Edge Case] [Null/Invalid QualifiedId] Can any of the QualifiedId lookups receive an invalid ID that points to a deleted or never-created entity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Edge Case] [Module Name Edge Cases] In cross-module check (line 157), what if builder.module_name is corrupted, empty, or contains special characters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Edge Case] [Associated Functions Map Empty] If associated_funs is empty (line 140), the loop does nothing - can this leave an incomplete IntrinsicDecl that causes issues later? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero-Length Declarations] Can an IntrinsicDecl be created with empty BTreeMaps for all function mappings? Would this cause lookup functions to always return None, potentially breaking dependent code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Rust Safety] [Clone Safety] IntrinsicDecl derives Clone (line 16) - are all cloned copies properly synchronized if modified through Arc or similar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Rust Safety] [Debug Format String Injection] IntrinsicDecl derives Debug (line 16) - can malicious symbol names or addresses cause format string issues when debug printed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Rust Safety] [BTreeMap Key Ordering] BTreeMap requires Ord on keys - can manipulation of Symbol or QualifiedId ordering cause unexpected map behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Rust Safety] [Deref Trait Abuse] Line 103 uses .deref() on INTRINSIC_TYPE_MAP_ASSOC_FUNCTIONS - can a malicious Deref implementation return different data on successive calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [State Corruption] [Builder State Inconsistency] Multiple accesses to builder.parent fields (struct_table, fun_table, spec_fun_table, intrinsics) - can these become inconsistent if errors occur during processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [State Corruption] [Intrinsics List Corruption] Line 129 pushes to builder.parent.intrinsics without checking for duplicates - can the same intrinsic be added multiple times causing ambiguity? (High)"
