  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: default_disabled()] [State transition] Can validators have race conditions switching between default_disabled() (Off) and enabled states during epoch transitions, causing some to process JWK updates while others don't? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ConfigV1] [Vector DoS] Can an attacker submit governance proposal with ConfigV1.oidc_providers containing thousands of providers, causing memory exhaustion and slow consensus when validators clone the vector in oidc_providers_cloned()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ConfigV1] [Empty vector] Can ConfigV1 with empty oidc_providers vector (like default_for_genesis) enable JWK consensus but provide no providers, causing keyless account transactions to always fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ConfigV1] [Duplicate providers] Can oidc_providers vector contain duplicate OIDCProvider entries with same name but different config_urls, causing JWK verification to use wrong keys or create consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ConfigV1] [Vector order] Does the order of providers in oidc_providers vector matter for consensus? Can different validators have different ordering due to HashMap usage, causing non-deterministic JWK lookups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: oidc_providers_cloned()] [Clone performance] The oidc_providers_cloned() function clones the entire vector (line 79) - can repeated calls during block processing cause performance degradation severe enough to miss consensus rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: oidc_providers_cloned()] [Memory leak] Can oidc_providers_cloned() be called in a loop without proper cleanup, causing memory leaks from repeated clones of large provider vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Enum: OnChainJWKConsensusConfig] [State confusion] Can validators have inconsistent enum states (some Off, some V1) during epoch transitions when config updates are propagated non-atomically? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: jwk_consensus_enabled()] [Boolean logic] The jwk_consensus_enabled() returns true for any V1 variant (line 72) regardless of whether oidc_providers is empty - can this cause enabled consensus with no providers, breaking keyless authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: jwk_consensus_enabled()] [Match exhaustiveness] If future versions add V2, V3 variants, will the match statement (line 70-73) correctly handle them or default to unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Enum: OnChainJWKConsensusConfig] [Variant size] Can ConfigV1 variants with large oidc_providers vectors cause memory layout issues or stack overflows when enum is copied on the stack? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: oidc_providers_cloned()] [Pattern match] The match returns empty vec for Off (line 78) but clones for V1 (line 79) - can this asymmetry cause issues where code expects providers but gets empty vec without error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Serialization correctness] Can the as_move_value() implementation (line 102-108) produce MoveValue that deserializes differently than the original Rust struct, causing state divergence between Move and Rust? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Variant packing] The packed_variant is converted to MoveValue and wrapped in MoveStruct::Runtime (line 107) - can this double-wrapping cause deserialization mismatches with Move code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Off variant] ConfigOff{} is packed as empty struct (line 104) - can this empty representation in Move be confused with uninitialized or null values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Type tag mismatch] Can discrepancies between MOVE_TYPE_NAME constants and actual Move module paths cause type verification failures when storing config on-chain? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: from()] [None handling] When features is None (line 128-129), config defaults to Off - can this cause security issues where feature flags fail to load but JWK consensus should remain enabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: from()] [Provider conversion] The filter_map on line 122 uses TryFrom which can fail - can malformed SupportedOIDCProviders with invalid UTF-8 cause silent provider drops, reducing JWK coverage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: from()] [Default vs empty] Line 119 uses unwrap_or_default() for missing SupportedOIDCProviders - can default() returning empty vector cause enabled JWK consensus with no providers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: from()] [TryFrom failure] If OIDCProvider::try_from fails for some providers (line 122), the error is silently dropped with .ok() - can this hide governance-approved providers, breaking keyless authentication?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Function: from()] [Deprecated resource] Comment line 111 mentions converting from deprecated resources - can this backward compatibility introduce security issues where old configs override new ones? (Medium)",
