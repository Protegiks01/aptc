  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 50: .clone()] [Memory exhaustion] Does cloning PathBuf on every call to aptos_core_path() create memory pressure if called repeatedly, potentially causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Static allocations] [Memory leaks] Are the Lazy and OnceCell static variables properly cleaned up at program exit, or could they cause memory leaks in long-running services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [String allocations] [Resource limits] Does include_str! load the entire release.yaml into memory as a compile-time constant, and could extremely large YAML files cause compilation failures or binary bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Path operations] [Absolute vs relative] Does aptos_core_path() return absolute paths after canonicalize(), and could mixing absolute and relative paths cause file access errors in other modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 31-32: .pop() twice] [Path traversal depth] Is calling .pop() exactly twice sufficient for all repository structures, or could alternative layouts break the path resolution logic? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Compiled configuration] [Binary verification] Can users verify that a distributed binary contains the expected RELEASE_CONFIG, or is it opaque once compiled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Release.yaml distribution] [Canonical source] Is there a single canonical source for release.yaml that gets cryptographically verified during builds, or could compromised forks inject malicious configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Binary reproducibility] [Build verification] Does the use of compile-time path resolution and include_str! prevent reproducible builds, making it impossible to verify that distributed binaries match source code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Version control] [Configuration history] Is the release.yaml file under version control with proper review, or could unauthorized changes be committed that later get compiled into release builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Release configuration] [Upgrade sequence validation] Does the RELEASE_CONFIG validate that governance proposal sequences maintain protocol invariants, or could invalid sequences break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Framework path usage] [Version mismatch] Could a mismatch between the framework code at aptos_framework_path() and the expected version cause proposals to generate invalid or insecure scripts? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Path initialization] [Test environment isolation] Can test code call initialize_aptos_core_path() to override paths for testing, and could this create security issues if test code runs in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Static configuration] [Test data contamination] Does using a static RELEASE_CONFIG prevent proper test isolation where different tests need different configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Compile-time constants] [Debug builds] Do debug builds include different configurations than release builds, and could this cause security-relevant behavior differences? (Medium)",
