  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [TTY setting vulnerability] The tty is explicitly set to false - while this prevents interactive access, can this configuration be exploited to hide malicious processes or prevent proper signal handling during shutdown? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Exposed ports declaration] The exposed_ports hashmap declares port exposure - can this metadata be read by other containers or processes to enumerate running workspaces and plan targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_assigned_port()] [Network settings parsing] The function navigates nested Option types to extract port - can malformed or unexpected network settings structure cause panic or incorrect behavior that crashes the workspace server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Command injection via env] Environment variables are set without sanitization - if any variables are influenced by external input, can this lead to command injection when PostgreSQL processes these environment variables during startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Shutdown signal handling] The CancellationToken is used for coordinated shutdown - can improper cancellation sequencing cause the database to be terminated mid-transaction, corrupting data or leaving the volume in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_connection_string()] [Cross-workspace access] Connection strings only differ by port number - can an attacker who obtains one workspace's port enumerate nearby ports to discover and access other workspaces' databases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Network mode isolation] All containers use the same network_mode pattern - can containers from different workspaces potentially communicate with each other if network isolation is improperly configured, allowing data leakage between workspaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Volume reuse vulnerability] If a volume from a terminated workspace isn't properly cleaned, can a new workspace with a colliding instance_id mount old data, exposing previous workspace's test transactions or validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Data path mounting] The volume is mounted to /var/lib/postgresql/data without fsync or durability guarantees - can power loss or system crash cause PostgreSQL data corruption that propagates to the workspace state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [No backup mechanism] There's no snapshot or backup functionality for the database - can catastrophic data loss occur if the volume becomes corrupted, losing all indexed transaction history without recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Database initialization race] PostgreSQL initializes the database on first start - can concurrent initialization attempts cause corruption if multiple containers try to initialize the same volume simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [make_shared wrapper] The fut_create_postgres is wrapped in make_shared for concurrent access - can this introduce subtle race conditions if the shared future's internal state is accessed concurrently during early abort or cancellation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Cleanup task synchronization] The cleanup task locks the Mutex to extract fut_container_clean_up - can high cleanup contention during mass workspace shutdown cause deadlocks or timeouts that prevent proper resource cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: fut_postgres_finish] [Container wait condition] The wait_container uses condition 'not-running' - can this condition be satisfied prematurely if the container enters a transient state, causing false alarms about database failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_assigned_port()] [Type conversion assumptions] The port extraction assumes string format and u16 parsing - can Docker return unexpected formats (IPv6 notation, service names) that cause silent failures or incorrect port extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_assigned_port()] [First binding assumption] The code uses bindings.first() assuming at least one port binding exists - can Docker return multiple conflicting bindings where taking first() picks the wrong one, causing connection to wrong service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [String conversion assumptions] Port numbers are converted to strings multiple times - can locale-dependent string formatting cause issues on non-English systems, leading to malformed Docker configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Missing security options] The container config lacks security_opt settings like 'no-new-privileges' - can this allow privilege escalation attacks within the container that might affect the host? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Read-only rootfs not set] The container doesn't use read_only_rootfs option - can attackers who compromise the container persist malware in the container filesystem that survives restarts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Missing ulimits] No ulimits are set for file descriptors or processes - can malicious code in the container fork-bomb or open excessive file descriptors, causing resource exhaustion on the host? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [DNS configuration missing] No DNS settings are specified - can this cause the container to use default DNS servers that might leak internal network topology or allow DNS rebinding attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [PostgreSQL extensions] No restrictions on loading PostgreSQL extensions - can an attacker load malicious extensions (like plpython) that execute arbitrary code within the database server, potentially breaking container isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Superuser access] The POSTGRES_USER 'postgres' has superuser privileges - can this elevated access be exploited to modify system catalogs, bypass row-level security, or execute privileged operations that corrupt the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [WAL configuration missing] Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) settings aren't configured - can this lead to data loss during crashes or make forensic analysis of database attacks impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Statement timeout missing] No statement_timeout is set - can malicious queries run indefinitely, causing resource exhaustion and preventing other workspaces from accessing their databases? (Medium)"
