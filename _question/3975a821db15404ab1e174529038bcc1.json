  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Gas metering bypass] Does compiling with compile_for_testing=true alter gas metering behavior or disable gas checks for certain operations, and can this be exploited to execute gas-free transactions or cause validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Language version gating] Since __COMPILE_FOR_TESTING__ requires language_version V2_2 or higher, can attackers manipulate version checks to enable testing features on older language versions that lack proper security isolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Test-only vulnerability exposure] Does enabling compile_for_testing expose additional attack surface through test-specific code paths that have weaker security validation than production paths, allowing exploitation of test mode vulnerabilities in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Trait: Default] [Unsafe defaults] Does the Default implementation for ModelBuilderOptions use secure default values, or does it default to dangerous configurations like ignore_pragma_opaque_when_possible=true that weaken verification security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Trait: Default] [Language version default] What language_version does Default provide, and can defaulting to an outdated version expose users to known vulnerabilities in legacy Move language features when they don't explicitly specify a version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Trait: Default] [Partial initialization attack] Can attackers exploit the serde default attribute to partially deserialize ModelBuilderOptions, leaving critical security fields at their Default values while only specifying attack-relevant fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Trait: Default] [Default propagation] When ModelBuilderOptions::default() is used in production code paths, does this accidentally enable testing mode or disable security features that should be explicitly configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [Extension storage race condition] When ModelBuilderOptions is stored in GlobalEnv via set_extension(), can race conditions occur if multiple threads attempt concurrent reads/writes, causing options to be corrupted or inconsistently applied across compilation units? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [Extension replacement attack] Can an attacker call set_extension() multiple times to overwrite ModelBuilderOptions mid-compilation, changing verification behavior for different modules within the same compilation session and creating inconsistent security guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: module_builder.rs] [Tweak timing vulnerability] If tweak_pragma_opaque() is called after certain functions are already verified, can this create a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where verified functions later have their opaque pragma ignored during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: builtins.rs] [Constant declaration mismatch] If options.compile_for_testing is checked in builtins.rs but the ModelBuilderOptions instance changes later, can this cause __COMPILE_FOR_TESTING__ to have inconsistent values across different compilation phases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: CLI] [Command-line injection] Can attackers inject malicious values through CLI arguments (--ignore-pragma-opaque-when-possible, etc.) that override safe configuration file settings, bypassing intended security policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Integration: prover.rs] [Framework compilation attack] When compiling the Aptos Framework with ModelBuilderOptions, can attackers use unsafe option combinations to bypass framework-specific security checks or alter critical system contract behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Non-deterministic compilation] Can different validators using different language_version values in their ModelBuilderOptions produce different compiled bytecode for the same Move source, causing state divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: ignore_pragma_opaque_*] [Verification non-determinism] Do the opaque pragma ignore flags affect the determinism of Move Prover verification results, potentially causing different validators to accept/reject the same module based on their local configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [All fields] [Configuration divergence] If different nodes in the Aptos network use different ModelBuilderOptions during on-chain module upgrades, can this cause some validators to accept malicious modules that others reject, leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Serialization determinism] Does the serde serialization of ModelBuilderOptions produce deterministic output across different architectures and Rust compiler versions, or can serialization differences cause consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Clone safety] Does the Clone trait implementation for ModelBuilderOptions properly deep-copy the LanguageVersion enum, or can shallow copies lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities when options are modified after cloning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Debug information leak] Can the Debug trait implementation for ModelBuilderOptions leak sensitive compilation configuration information through error messages or logs that attackers could use to fingerprint vulnerable compiler versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Enum size assumption] Does code assume LanguageVersion enum fits in a fixed size, and can adding new language versions cause buffer overflows in serialization buffers or network packets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Privilege escalation via testing mode] Can unprivileged users compile Move modules with compile_for_testing=true and deploy them to gain access to privileged test-only native functions or bypass access control checks in framework modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Fields: ignore_pragma_opaque_*] [Verification privilege bypass] Can attackers use opaque pragma ignore flags to bypass verification of access control invariants in system modules, allowing deployment of modules that violate security properties? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Configuration privilege] Are ModelBuilderOptions restricted to privileged compilation contexts only, or can untrusted user code specify custom options during on-chain module deployment to weaken security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Consensus metadata attack] Since language_version gets embedded in CompilationMetadata with COMPILATION_METADATA_KEY, can attackers manipulate this metadata to cause validators to execute bytecode differently based on claimed vs actual language version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Unstable flag manipulation] Can attackers clear the 'unstable' flag in CompilationMetadata while compiling with unstable language versions (V2_3+), allowing deployment of experimental code on production networks?
