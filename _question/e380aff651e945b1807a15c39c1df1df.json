  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Broadcast failure handling] At line 292, the broadcast is expected to succeed with expect(), but if it actually fails, does this panic and crash the entire RandManager? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Phase timeout] Neither phase1 nor the certified broadcast in lines 333-341 have explicit timeouts - can a single slow validator block the entire aug data broadcast indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [RPC timeout] The rpc_timeout_ms at line 94 controls RPC timeouts - if this is set too low, can honest validators fail to respond in time under load, reducing effective validator count below safety threshold? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_blocks()] [Metadata extraction] At line 138, FullRandMetadata::from(block.block()) extracts metadata - can malicious blocks contain malformed metadata that crashes the conversion or produces invalid RandMetadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Metadata validation] Does the code validate that metadata.round() at line 150 matches the block's round number, or can mismatched metadata cause randomness to be assigned to wrong rounds? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Metadata consistency] At line 271, metadata.round is used for aggregation - if different validators extract different metadata from the same block, can they request shares for different rounds and never reach consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start() - Share handling] [Error propagation] At lines 421-423, if add_share() fails, only a warning is logged - should repeated failures trigger more severe actions like reporting Byzantine behavior or halting? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start() - RequestShare handling] [Error recovery] At lines 409-411, if get_self_share() fails, only a warning is logged and no response is sent - can this cause the requester to timeout and fail to aggregate shares? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Deserialization error handling] At lines 254-256, deserialization errors are logged but the message is dropped - can an attacker deliberately send malformed messages to test implementation boundaries and identify vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Share addition failure] At line 155, add_share() is expected to succeed, but what happens if the store is full, corrupted, or encounters an unexpected error - does this panic and halt randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_blocks()] [Queue item creation] At line 141, QueueItem::new() stores broadcast handles - if these handles are dropped prematurely, can ongoing broadcasts be aborted before completing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_randomness()] [Block reference] At line 203, block_queue.item_mut() gets a mutable reference - can concurrent access from process_incoming_blocks() cause data races since block_queue is not behind a Mutex? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Dequeue ordering] At line 469, dequeue_rand_ready_prefix() is called after processing all events - can the order of dequeuing affect which blocks are sent downstream, causing validators to commit blocks in different orders? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_ready_blocks()] [Empty blocks] If ready_blocks is empty at line 171, the function still iterates - can this waste CPU cycles in tight loops under certain conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Interval drift] At line 377, tokio::time::interval is set to 5000ms - if system time changes or timer skew occurs, can this cause observe_queue() to be called too frequently or too rarely? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Sleep timing] The 300ms sleep at line 274 is hardcoded - can network conditions cause this to be too short (missing late shares) or too long (delaying consensus unnecessarily)? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Time service] TimeService::real() at line 93 is used for reliable broadcast - if system time is manipulated or unsynchronized across validators, can this cause timeouts to fire inconsistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Executor saturation] If bounded_executor at line 234 is saturated with verification tasks, can new legitimate messages fail to be verified in time, causing honest validators to miss shares? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Broadcast amplification] At line 167, every incoming block triggers a broadcast to all validators - can an attacker flood blocks to amplify network traffic quadratically (N validators × M blocks)?

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Memory leak] The _guard at line 376 is returned from broadcast_aug_data() but never stored - if this leaks memory by not properly cleaning up abort handles, can it cause gradual resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Validator ordering] At line 90, get_ordered_account_addresses() determines validator order - if this ordering is manipulated or non-deterministic, can validators disagree on message routing and fail to reach consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Validator filtering] At lines 281-283, existing_shares filters out validators who already sent shares - if a Byzantine validator sends shares late, can they avoid being requested and break share aggregation?
