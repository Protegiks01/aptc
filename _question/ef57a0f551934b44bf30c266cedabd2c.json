  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty rejection vector semantics] Does returning Ok(vec![]) correctly signal 'allowed' to the caller, or could this be misinterpreted as 'no opinion' leading to security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Single rejection reason] The function only returns one RejectionReason - could this be insufficient if multiple blocking conditions are met, causing incomplete security reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [RejectionReasonCode consistency] Is RejectionReasonCode::RefererBlocklisted used consistently across all referer-related rejections, or could mismatches cause monitoring/alerting failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [No blocklist reload mechanism] The blocklist is loaded only at initialization - can attackers exploit this by having their referer blocklisted, getting rejected, then waiting for the operator to remove the block, but the change never takes effect without restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Blocklist file locking] Is the blocklist file properly locked during loading, or can concurrent modifications to the file cause partial/corrupted blocklist loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Blocklist file permissions] Are blocklist file permissions validated to ensure only authorized users can modify it, preventing attackers from removing blocklist entries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [TOCTOU race condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where an attacker modifies the blocklist file between permission checks and actual loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Exact match limitation] Does ListManager only support exact string matching, preventing effective blocking of domain families or wildcard patterns (e.g., '*.evil.com')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Substring matching] If blocklist entries are checked as substrings, can attackers use 'evilsite.com' to bypass a block on 'evil.com' by matching the substring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Struct: RefererBlocklistChecker] [Memory leak] Does the ListManager properly deallocate memory when the RefererBlocklistChecker is dropped, or can repeated initialization/destruction leak memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [String allocation overhead] Does creating a new formatted string for each rejection cause excessive allocations under high reject rates, enabling memory exhaustion DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Header value lifetime] Does the checker properly handle header value lifetimes, or could dangling references occur if the HeaderMap is modified concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Struct: RefererBlocklistChecker] [Checker ordering dependency] Does the cost value of 2 place this checker in the correct order relative to other checkers, or could improper ordering allow bypasses before this check runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Struct: RefererBlocklistChecker] [Checker composition bypass] Can attackers craft requests that pass the referer blocklist but fail other checkers in ways that expose the blocklist contents through error message differences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Referer spoofing trust] Does the checker incorrectly trust the client-provided Referer header, which can be trivially spoofed by attackers, making this security control ineffective? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Browser referer policy bypass] Can attackers use restrictive Referer-Policy headers (no-referrer, same-origin) to prevent the browser from sending referers, bypassing the blocklist check entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [CORS preflight bypass] Can attackers use CORS preflight OPTIONS requests that may not include referer headers to probe or bypass the blocklist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [to_str() panic safety] Does the code properly handle the case where to_str() returns Err, or could unexpected header encodings cause panics in production? (Low)",
