  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::NotConnected] [Timing oracle] Can the timing difference between NotConnected errors for different PeerIds reveal information about internal data structures or validator set membership, enabling targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::WireWriteError] [State recovery] After a WireWriteError, is the connection state properly rolled back, or can partial writes leave the wire protocol in an inconsistent state that causes subsequent messages to be misinterpreted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::WireReadError] [Protocol desync] Does WireReadError handling properly reset the protocol state machine, or can read errors leave the reader in a partially-read state that causes subsequent valid messages to be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::BcsError] [Partial deserialization] Can BcsError occur after partial deserialization has already modified shared state, leading to inconsistent state that violates invariants and enables consensus bypass attacks?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Trait: From<wire::WriteError>] [Error conversion] Can the conversion from wire::WriteError to PeerManagerError mask critical protocol violations, allowing malicious messages to be sent despite write errors that should have aborted the transmission?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError] [Consensus message loss] Can errors in PeerManagerError variants cause consensus messages (proposals, votes, commits) to be silently dropped without proper error handling, breaking consensus safety or liveness guarantees? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Function: from_transport_error()] [Auth bypass] Can authentication or authorization failures be incorrectly converted to generic TransportError, allowing unauthenticated peers to remain connected and participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::TransportError] [Identity spoofing] Does TransportError handling verify peer identity before closing connections, or can attackers spoof transport errors to cause disconnection of legitimate validators while maintaining their own malicious connections?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError] [Network partition] Can coordinated error triggering across multiple error variants cause cascading failures that partition the validator network, preventing consensus progress and halting the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::MpscSendError] [Partition attack] Can attackers exploit MpscSendError by blocking internal channels to create communication failures between honest validators, artificially partitioning the network below Byzantine fault tolerance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError] [Error amplification] Can a single malicious message trigger cascading errors across multiple error variants, causing amplified resource consumption or network disruption disproportionate to the attack effort? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::WireReadError] [Error storm] Can specially crafted messages that trigger WireReadError cause error storms that overwhelm logging systems or error monitoring infrastructure, masking other security incidents?
