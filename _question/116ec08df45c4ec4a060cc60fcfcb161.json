  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [String Encoding] Does the function properly handle non-ASCII characters in issuer and config_url strings when converting to Move b\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Result Error Handling] Does the anyhow::Result return type properly propagate all error conditions from generate_governance_proposal and write_op, or can errors be silently swallowed, allowing invalid proposals to be submitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Empty Operations] What happens if the ops slice is empty - does the function still generate a valid proposal that only calls reconfigure(), or can this cause unexpected behavior in the governance system when proposals with no operations are executed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Vec Tuple Return] Can the Vec<(String, String)> return type containing (name, script) tuples be exploited if callers assume a specific ordering or count, especially since the function only pushes a single tuple at line 46? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Iterator Ownership] Does the iteration over ops at line 39 properly handle ownership semantics, or can malformed operations cause the iterator to panic or skip operations due to borrow checker edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker precompute a collision for the next_execution_hash parameter in multi-step proposals, allowing them to execute a malicious second step that wasn't part of the original voted proposal, bypassing governance approval? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Hash Verification] Does the multi-step proposal mechanism verify that next_execution_hash matches the actual hash of the next execution script before allowing continuation, or can mismatches allow unauthorized proposal steps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Hash Type Safety] Is the HashValue type cryptographically secure (using SHA-256 or stronger), or does it use a weaker hash function vulnerable to collision attacks that could compromise multi-step proposal integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Concurrent Proposals] Can multiple governance proposals modifying OIDC providers execute concurrently on different validators, creating race conditions where the final state depends on execution order, potentially causing validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Config Buffer Race] Since upsert_oidc_provider_for_next_epoch uses config_buffer, can concurrent proposals overwrite each other's buffered changes, causing only the last proposal's changes to take effect despite multiple proposals being voted on and approved? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Validator JWK Fetch Race] Can the time window between Upserting a provider and validators actually fetching JWKs from the new config_url be exploited by attackers who submit rapid Remove operations, causing validators to waste resources fetching from already-removed providers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Signer Type Mismatch] Can the get_signer_arg function return an incorrect signer reference type (framework_signer vs &framework_signer) based on is_testnet/is_multi_step, causing type errors or incorrect permission checks when the generated Move code executes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Signer Propagation] Does the signer_arg variable passed to jwks functions at lines 57, 69, and 74 always correspond to the aptos_framework signer, or can incorrect proposal generation cause it to reference a different account with insufficient permissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Testnet Signer Bypass] If is_testnet is true, does the signer obtained via get_signer_testnet_only have different permission levels than the production governance signer, potentially allowing operations on testnet that would be blocked on mainnet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Import Missing] Does the generated proposal properly import the aptos_framework::jwks module in the deps_names parameter at line 37, or can missing imports cause the proposal script to fail compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Semicolon Correctness] Are semicolons properly placed after each Move statement (lines 59, 70, 77), or can missing/extra semicolons cause Move syntax errors that prevent proposal execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [CodeWriter State] Does the CodeWriter maintain correct indentation and scope throughout multiple write_op calls in the loop at line 40, or can state corruption cause malformed Move code generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Reconfigure Placement] Is the aptos_governance::reconfigure call at line 42 correctly placed after all OIDC operations, or can loop logic errors cause it to be emitted before operations complete, triggering epoch transition with partially applied changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Function Name Typos] Are the Move function names jwks::upsert_oidc_provider_for_next_epoch and jwks::remove_oidc_provider_for_next_epoch spelled correctly, or can typos cause runtime errors when the proposal executes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [API Version] Does the code call the deprecated upsert_oidc_provider or the new upsert_oidc_provider_for_next_epoch function, and can this cause issues if validators are running different framework versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Config Buffer Compatibility] Can proposals generated by this code execute correctly on older validators that don't support the config_buffer system, potentially causing proposals to fail or apply changes immediately instead of at next epoch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Feature Flag Dependency] Does the generated proposal check for required feature flags (like JWK consensus modes) before executing, or can proposals execute on networks where the features aren't enabled, causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Memory Allocation] Can extremely large ops vectors cause excessive memory allocation during proposal generation, leading to OOM errors in the release builder tool before the proposal is even submitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [String Concatenation] Does the repeated string formatting in emitln! macros at lines 53-59, 67-77 cause quadratic string concatenation costs that make large proposals computationally expensive to generate? (Low)",
