  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [State persistence] Do any of these simulation functions accidentally persist state changes to the actual blockchain database, or are they guaranteed to be read-only operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: run_transaction_using_debugger()] [Reentrancy] If the transaction being simulated calls back into the simulation framework through some mechanism, could this cause reentrancy issues or infinite loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [Statistical manipulation] Could an attacker craft a transaction that behaves differently on different iterations (e.g., based on timing, cache state, or iteration count) to manipulate benchmark results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Report injection] Could an attacker inject malicious content into the gas profiling report that exploits vulnerabilities in report viewing tools or compromises audit workflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Type confusion] The functions accept SignedTransaction - is there proper type validation to ensure this isn't actually a GenesisTransaction, BlockMetadata, or other transaction type that should have different handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Clock manipulation] If the system clock is manipulated during simulation, could this affect transaction execution, timeout handling, or epoch transitions in ways that reveal vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Feature flag bypass] Does the simulation respect all feature flags and protocol version settings, or could simulations test features that aren't yet enabled, revealing vulnerabilities before activation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Memory safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or raw pointer operations in the call chain? Could malicious transactions exploit memory safety issues through the simulation interface? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Panic safety] If a transaction causes a panic during simulation, is this properly caught and handled, or could panics crash the simulation process and cause denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: run_transaction_using_debugger()] [Move VM exploits] Could an attacker craft Move bytecode that exploits VM vulnerabilities only exposed during simulation due to different initialization or missing safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [Cache timing attacks] Does the cold vs warm cache timing data leak information about code structure, module dependencies, or execution paths that could be exploited in side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Filesystem race conditions] Between path construction and file creation, could an attacker win a race condition to create a symlink, allowing arbitrary file writes through TOCTOU vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [AuxiliaryInfo validation] Is PersistedAuxiliaryInfo properly validated before being wrapped in AuxiliaryInfo? Could malformed auxiliary data cause VM crashes or incorrect execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [VMOutput handling] Are there any security-sensitive fields in VMOutput that could leak information or be manipulated? Does the output properly represent all side effects of execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [VMStatus interpretation] Could an attacker craft transactions that return misleading VMStatus codes, causing callers to misinterpret success/failure and proceed with invalid operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: run_transaction_using_debugger()] [Resolver caching] Does the move_resolver maintain internal caches that could become stale or inconsistent across multiple simulation calls on the same debugger instance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [Timing precision] Are the Instant measurements precise enough to detect subtle performance differences, or could measurement noise hide performance regressions introduced by malicious code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Gas log integrity] Is the gas profiling data cryptographically signed or authenticated? Could malicious code manipulate gas measurements to hide its true resource consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Debugger trust] Does AptosDebugger perform sufficient validation, or is it assumed to be trusted? Could a compromised or malicious debugger instance feed incorrect state data to simulations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [VM version mismatch] If the AptosVM version used in simulation differs from the production VM version, could this allow discovering exploits that work only in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Code storage consistency] Are there consistency guarantees between the resolver and code_storage? Could they reference different versions of the same module causing execution with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: run_transaction_using_debugger()] [Log context ID] Does using state_view.id() for log context create any privacy or security concerns? Could log IDs be correlated to track user activity or state access patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [Benchmark accuracy] If the benchmark results don't match production performance, could this hide DoS attacks that only manifest in production under load? (Medium)",
