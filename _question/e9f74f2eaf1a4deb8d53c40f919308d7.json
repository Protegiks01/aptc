  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Caching] Is there any caching mechanism for fetched JWKs, or does every transaction validation fetch JWKs from the network causing massive bandwidth usage and slow transaction processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Stale Keys] If JWKs are cached without checking Cache-Control or max-age headers, can stale keys remain in use after they've been rotated, preventing valid keyless account access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Config Caching] Is the jwks_uri extracted from OpenID configuration cached, or is the config endpoint hit repeatedly causing unnecessary external requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Struct: OpenIDConfiguration] [Issuer Field] The issuer field in OpenIDConfiguration is deserialized but never validated - can an attacker provide any issuer value without verification, enabling issuer substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Issuer Mismatch] Can an attacker provide a config_url from domain A that returns an issuer value for domain B, causing validators to accept JWTs from unintended issuers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Struct: OpenIDConfiguration] [Ignored Fields] Are critical OpenID configuration fields like 'authorization_endpoint', 'token_endpoint', or 'userinfo_endpoint' being ignored, potentially missing security-relevant metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Private IP Access] Can an attacker provide jwks_uri pointing to private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) to scan internal validator infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Localhost Access] Can an attacker use jwks_uri='http://localhost' or '127.0.0.1' to access services running on the validator node itself, potentially hitting admin interfaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Cloud Metadata Services] Can an attacker use jwks_uri='http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/' to access cloud provider metadata services and steal validator credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [IPv6 Bypass] Can an attacker use IPv6 addresses or IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses to bypass any IP-based SSRF protections and access internal services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [URL Parameter Injection] Can an attacker append query parameters to jwks_uri that modify behavior (e.g., '?redirect=evil.com' or '?debug=true') on vulnerable OpenID provider implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker use path traversal in jwks_uri like 'https://provider.com/../../admin/jwks' to access unintended endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [URL Fragment] Does the presence of URL fragments (e.g., '#fragment') in jwks_uri affect HTTP request behavior or get passed to the server in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: test_fetch_real_jwks()] [Production Data Leak] The test function at lines 47-58 makes real external requests to Facebook's OpenID endpoint - can this accidentally run in production and leak validator behavior or IPs to Facebook? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: test_fetch_real_jwks()] [Test Bypass] Is the #[ignore] attribute properly respected in all build configurations, or can this test run during production builds causing unexpected network requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a JWKs response with thousands or millions of keys in the Vec<serde_json::Value>, exhausting validator memory and causing out-of-memory crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Collection Conversion] Does keys.into_iter().map(JWK::from).collect() properly handle allocation failures when converting large key sets, or can it panic and crash the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [String Memory] Can extremely long string values in JWK fields (like 'x5c' certificate chains) cause string allocation failures or integer overflows in length calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [TLS Version] Does reqwest enforce minimum TLS versions (TLS 1.2+), or can an attacker downgrade connections to SSLv3/TLS 1.0 with known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Cipher Suite] Does the HTTP client restrict to secure cipher suites, or can weak ciphers like RC4, DES, or export-grade ciphers be negotiated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Certificate Pinning] Is certificate pinning implemented for known OpenID providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), or can any CA-signed certificate be accepted enabling rogue CA attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Struct: JWKsResponse] [Type Safety] Why is keys field typed as Vec<serde_json::Value> instead of Vec<JWK>, allowing arbitrary JSON that might not be valid JWKs to be stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Struct: OpenIDConfiguration] [Missing Validation] Does OpenIDConfiguration have any validation logic in a constructor or custom deserializer, or can it contain invalid data like empty strings or malformed URLs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Struct: JWKsResponse] [Field Visibility] Both structs have private fields with only Serialize/Deserialize derives - is there any validation when these are constructed programmatically? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Caller Validation] Where is this function called from in Aptos Core, and are callers properly handling the Result type including all error cases like network failures and parse errors? (High)"
