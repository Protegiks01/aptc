  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Transaction type validation] Are there transaction types that should not be simulated (e.g., system transactions, validator set changes)? Could simulating restricted transaction types reveal vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Empty transaction] What happens if an empty or malformed SignedTransaction is provided? Is there proper validation before execution, or could this cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [Iteration count] The hardcoded n=15 iterations - could an attacker exploit this predictable count to craft timing-based attacks that only succeed on iteration 15? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Transaction batch] What is FrameName::TransactionBatch and when is it used? Could transaction batches bypass certain validation or create unexpected security properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Lossless address conversion] The address uses short_str_lossless() - under what conditions would lossy conversion occur, and could this cause security issues if addresses are not uniquely represented? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Memory leaks] Are all resources properly cleaned up after simulation? Could repeated simulations cause memory leaks in the debugger, state_view, or VM instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: benchmark_transaction_using_debugger()] [VM allocation] Creating 15 new VM instances in the cold cache loop - could this cause excessive memory allocation or fragmentation, especially for large or complex transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Disk space validation] Is there any check for available disk space before writing the gas report? Could repeated profiling fill up disk space causing system failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Thread safety] Are these functions thread-safe? Could concurrent simulations on the same debugger instance cause race conditions or data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Cleanup on error] If simulation fails midway, are partial resources properly cleaned up, or could errors leave the debugger or state_view in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Hash validation] The hash parameter is unused in run/benchmark functions - was this intended to verify transaction hash integrity? Could omitting hash checks allow transaction tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: profile_transaction_using_debugger()] [Hash collision] If two different transactions produce the same hash value, could this cause report filename collisions or security issues in tracking/auditing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Signature verification] Is the SignedTransaction's signature verified against current epoch validators, or could simulations execute transactions signed by invalid/expired keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Nonce/sequence validation] Are sequence numbers properly validated and updated during simulation? Could simulations execute transactions with duplicate sequence numbers that would fail in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Simulation divergence] What guarantees exist that simulation results match production execution? Could subtle differences allow attackers to test exploits that only work in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Network effects] Simulations are local - could transaction behavior differ in production due to network delays, consensus timing, or parallel execution that aren't modeled in simulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Epoch boundaries] If a transaction is simulated at an epoch boundary, could epoch transition logic cause different behavior than production where consensus coordinates epoch changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [Validator set differences] Does simulation use the correct validator set for the specified version? Could using wrong validator sets allow testing attacks on outdated/future validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [Function: run_transaction_using_debugger()] [Block metadata] Simulations don't include block metadata - could this cause transactions that depend on block information (timestamp, height, proposer) to behave incorrectly? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/local_simulation.rs] [All Functions] [System address bypass] Does simulation properly enforce protection on system addresses (0x1, 0x2, etc.), or could simulations test unauthorized access to framework modules? (High)",
