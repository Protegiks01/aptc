  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Input validation] Can an attacker create a FunctionInfo with an empty module_name or function_name string, potentially bypassing validation checks in transaction prologue/epilogue dispatch and causing undefined behavior or validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [String injection] Can an attacker inject special characters (null bytes, control characters, Unicode normalization attacks) into module_name or function_name fields, leading to inconsistent function resolution across validators and causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Address spoofing] Can an attacker craft a FunctionInfo with module_address pointing to a malicious module that mimics system modules (0x1, 0x3, 0x4), bypassing access controls in governance or transaction validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker create a FunctionInfo with extremely long module_name or function_name strings (e.g., megabytes), causing memory exhaustion during serialization, deserialization, or validation, leading to validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Unicode normalization] If module_name or function_name contain Unicode characters, can different Unicode normalization forms (NFC vs NFD) lead to different hash values or function lookups, causing non-deterministic execution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Case sensitivity] Are module_name and function_name comparisons case-sensitive? Can an attacker exploit case variations to bypass security checks or resolve to different functions than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Whitespace handling] Can leading/trailing whitespace in module_name or function_name bypass validation or cause function resolution failures, leading to transaction validation bypass or governance proposal execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Path traversal] Can module_name or function_name contain path traversal sequences (../, .., etc.) that could be exploited in file system operations or module loading, potentially accessing unauthorized code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: new()] [No validation] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on inputs? Can attackers pass arbitrary invalid data that causes failures later in the execution pipeline, potentially after state modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can repeated calls to new() with large strings cause heap fragmentation or memory exhaustion, particularly in hot paths like transaction validation where FunctionInfo instances are created frequently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Format string injection] Can malicious content in module_name or function_name exploit format string vulnerabilities when Display is used in logging or error messages, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Hex encoding consistency] Does to_hex() produce consistent output across different Rust versions or platforms? Can inconsistencies lead to different string representations and break function lookups or governance proposal validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [String concatenation overflow] Can very long module_address, module_name, or function_name cause buffer overflow or allocation failures during string formatting, leading to panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Injection in logging] If the Display output is used in logging systems without proper sanitization, can attackers inject log poisoning attacks (CRLF injection) to manipulate logs and hide malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Determinism] Is the Display output deterministic across all validators? Can non-deterministic formatting (e.g., address hex encoding variations) lead to consensus failures or state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from(MemberId)] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide a malformed MemberId that produces an invalid FunctionInfo, bypassing validation checks that expect well-formed function identifiers in transaction validation or governance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from(MemberId)] [String conversion safety] Does into_string() on Identifier properly handle all possible byte sequences? Can malformed identifiers produce non-UTF8 strings or invalid module/function names that cause panics downstream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from(MemberId)] [Address consistency] Can the module_id.address in MemberId differ from the expected address format used in FunctionInfo, causing address resolution failures or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from(MemberId)] [Resource leak] If into_string() allocates memory that isn't properly managed, can repeated conversions from MemberId to FunctionInfo cause memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Parsing bypass] Since from_str() delegates to MemberId::from_str(), can an attacker craft a string that passes MemberId parsing but creates an invalid FunctionInfo, bypassing security checks in governance proposals or transaction validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Delimiter injection] Can an attacker inject additional '::' delimiters in the input string to create ambiguous parsing results, leading to function resolution to unintended modules or functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Null byte injection] Can null bytes in the input string terminate parsing early, causing the parser to accept incomplete or malformed function identifiers that later cause crashes or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Integer overflow in parsing] When parsing the address component, can extremely large hex values cause integer overflow or wraparound, mapping to unintended addresses including system addresses (0x1)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Error handling] If MemberId::from_str() returns an error, does the error message leak sensitive information about internal module structure or validation logic that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [DOS via parsing] Can an attacker provide extremely complex or nested input strings that cause exponential parsing time in MemberId::from_str(), leading to validator DoS during transaction or governance proposal validation?
