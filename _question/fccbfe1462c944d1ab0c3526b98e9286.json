  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: get_next_vm()] [RNG predictability] Is thread_rng() seeded securely, or can predictable seeds allow attackers to determine which validator will handle their transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: get_next_vm()] [RNG bias] Does gen_range provide uniform distribution, or can bias cause some validators to be selected more often creating load imbalance? (Low)",

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: validate_transaction()] [Validation completeness] Does validation check all transaction validity conditions (signature, sequence, gas, sender balance), or can incomplete checks allow invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Function: validate_transaction()] [Side effects] Is validation truly side-effect free, or can it modify shared state that affects subsequent validations? (Critical)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Struct: PooledVMValidator] [Pool size optimization] Is the pool size configurable per deployment, and can incorrect sizing cause validation bottlenecks or resource waste? (Low)",

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Logging] [Log injection] Can attacker-controlled transaction data inject malicious log entries for log-based monitoring bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Type: AptosVM] [VM state isolation] When creating AptosVM instances, are they properly isolated, or can state leak between validations? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Type: AptosVM] [VM reuse] Should AptosVM instances be reused instead of recreating on line 160, and does recreation prevent VM state caching optimizations? (Low)",
