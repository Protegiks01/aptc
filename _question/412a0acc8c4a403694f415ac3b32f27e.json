  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Clone/Copy semantics] Are there unsafe Clone implementations that could lead to double-free or use-after-free when events are copied across threads or stored in multiple locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Getter methods] [Lifetime issues] Do the getter methods returning references have proper lifetime annotations to prevent dangling references if the underlying DefaultPropertyMutate is moved or dropped? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Hash collision] If these events are stored in hash maps or sets, can attackers craft events with colliding hashes to cause performance degradation or enable collision-based attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: collection/token] [Path traversal] Can collection or token names containing path separators (/, \\) cause directory traversal vulnerabilities in systems that store events in file systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Type coercion vulnerabilities] Can attackers exploit implicit type coercion between similar types (e.g., u64 vs u128) by providing ambiguous `typ` strings that cause incorrect value interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Fuzzing coverage] Has this deserialization function been extensively fuzzed with malformed inputs? Can novel BCS encoding edge cases trigger panics, infinite loops, or memory corruption? (Medium)"
