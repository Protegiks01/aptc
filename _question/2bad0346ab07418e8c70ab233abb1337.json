  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RedisRatelimitChecker] Can attackers cause Redis key expiration to fail by sending requests that create keys with extremely long TTL values, causing the database to run out of memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RedisRatelimitChecker] If Redis connection fails during check(), does the system fail open (allowing request) or fail closed (rejecting request), and can attackers exploit connection failures to bypass rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: IpBlocklistChecker] Does IpBlocklistChecker properly handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (::ffff:192.0.2.1), or can attackers bypass IP blocklists by using IPv6 format for blocked IPv4 addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: IpBlocklistChecker] Can the IP blocklist be bypassed by using IP addresses in CIDR ranges that overlap but aren't exactly matching the blocklist entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: GoogleCaptchaChecker] Can attackers replay valid Google Captcha tokens multiple times before they expire, or does the checker properly track used tokens to prevent replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: GoogleCaptchaChecker] Does GoogleCaptchaChecker validate the captcha response's IP address matches the request's source_ip, or can attackers solve captchas from one IP and use them from another IP to bypass IP-based rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: GoogleCaptchaChecker] If Google's captcha verification API is down or slow, does this cause the entire faucet to become unavailable, allowing attackers to DoS the faucet by causing captcha verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: TapCaptchaChecker] Can the in-memory HashMap for captcha challenges grow unbounded as noted in the warning comment, allowing attackers to cause OOM by requesting millions of captcha challenges without solving them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: TapCaptchaChecker] Does CaptchaManager prevent captcha key collisions when generating random u32 keys, or can attackers guess valid keys with birthday attack probabilities to bypass captcha validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: TapCaptchaChecker] Since captcha keys are removed after successful verification in check_challenge(), can attackers cause timing attacks to determine valid captcha solutions by measuring response times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: TapCaptchaChecker] Can attackers exploit the Mutex<CaptchaManager> to cause lock contention DoS by rapidly requesting captcha challenges, blocking legitimate users from verifying captchas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MagicHeaderChecker] Does MagicHeaderChecker properly validate header values using constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks that reveal the magic header value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MagicHeaderChecker] Can attackers bypass the magic header check by sending headers with different encodings (UTF-8, ASCII, Unicode) that match after normalization but aren't detected by the checker? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RefererBlocklistChecker] Can attackers bypass referer blocklisting by not sending a Referer header at all, since the checker returns Ok(vec![]) when the header is missing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RefererBlocklistChecker] Does RefererBlocklistChecker validate the referer URL format to prevent bypass through URL encoding, relative paths, or other URL manipulation techniques? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Checker Ordering] If checkers are executed in cost() order (cheapest first), can attackers exploit this by ensuring expensive database-backed checkers run last, allowing them to exhaust resources on requests that should be rejected by cheap checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Checker Ordering] Does the system short-circuit checker execution when the first rejection is found, or do all checkers run regardless, allowing attackers to cause unnecessary resource consumption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Checker Ordering] Can the order of checker execution be manipulated through configuration to bypass security, such as running rate limiters before authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Error Handling] If check() returns AptosTapError instead of Ok(Vec<RejectionReason>), does the system properly distinguish between rejection (should not retry) and internal errors (might retry), and can attackers exploit this to bypass rate limits through retry logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Error Handling] Does the system log all RejectionReasons returned by checkers, or can attackers make unlimited silent requests that get rejected without alerting operators to ongoing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Error Handling] If complete() returns an error, does the system retry complete() operations, and can this cause double-decrement of rate limits leading to negative counters and bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Error Handling] Can AptosTapError error codes be exploited to trigger different code paths that bypass security checks or leak sensitive information about the faucet's internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Edge Case] What happens if CheckerData contains malformed UTF-8 in headers, causing to_str() calls to fail in checkers - does this cause rejections or bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Edge Case] Can attackers send requests with AccountAddress set to special addresses (0x0, 0x1 system addresses) to bypass checks that assume normal user addresses? (High)",
