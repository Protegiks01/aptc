  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Staking: Stake transitions] [State consistency] Can attackers query intermediate states during stake transitions (active→pending_inactive→inactive) to gain unfair information? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Staking: Multiple pools] [Pool confusion] Can an address be delegated to multiple pools simultaneously, and do the identifiers handle this correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Type system: Eq/PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Are the Eq implementations for all types cryptographically safe, or could attackers create distinct identifiers that compare as equal? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Documentation: Sub-account address field] [Semantic overloading] The documentation says address can be 'stake', 'stake-<operator>', or pool-related - is this overloading clearly documented to prevent misuse? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Documentation: Fake hash] [Security warning] Is it clearly documented that BlockIdentifier.hash is NOT a cryptographic hash and shouldn't be used for security verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Documentation: Sub-account types] [Type enumeration] Is there a complete list of all valid sub-account types, or could new types be added without validation? (Low)",
