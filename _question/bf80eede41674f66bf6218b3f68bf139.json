  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Medium - Benchmark Isolation] The code uses Arc<BlockExecutor<V>> which could be shared - are benchmarks properly isolated from production validators to prevent cross-contamination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [High - Output Ledger Update Structure] Lines 86-88 access output.ledger_update_output.transaction_accumulator - can a malformed output object cause panics or provide incorrect accumulator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Medium - Block Info Construction] Lines 34-40 construct BlockInfo with specific field ordering - are there any fields that could cause security issues if swapped or provided in wrong order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Medium - Instant Timing Assumptions] Lines 80-83, 95, 107 use Instant for timing - if the system clock is not monotonic, can backwards time jumps cause panics or incorrect duration calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Low - Comment Accuracy] Line 36 says round 'doesn't matter' and line 37 says id 'doesn't matter' - are these assumptions correct, or can these values affect downstream consensus logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Low - Logging Verbosity] Lines 126-157 log extensive benchmark data - in high-throughput scenarios, can excessive logging cause I/O bottlenecks or disk space exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Critical - Executor State Assumptions] Lines 97-98 call executor methods assuming they're in correct state - if pre_commit_block or commit_ledger have precondition requirements, can calling them out of order corrupt executor state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [High - Database Consistency] Line 98 commits to ledger - if the underlying database (AptosDB) has bugs or corruption, does commit_ledger detect and reject invalid state or commit it blindly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [High - Transaction Accumulator Integrity] Line 88 uses transaction_accumulator.root_hash() - if the accumulator implementation has bugs, can it produce incorrect root hashes that break Merkle proof verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Medium - Metric Registry Shared State] Lines 91, 141-144, 155 access global metrics - are there race conditions in the metrics registry when multiple benchmark instances run concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/transaction_committer.rs] [Medium - LedgerInfo Version Consistency] Line 96 creates LedgerInfo with version from output - does the executor validate that this version matches its internal state before committing? (Medium)"
