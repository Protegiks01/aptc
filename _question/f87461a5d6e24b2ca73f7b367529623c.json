  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Type Resolution] At line 271 and 306, resolve_type_args() converts parsed TypeTags, but can malformed type arguments bypass Move's kind system, allowing instantiation with non-copyable types where copy is required? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Arg Resolution] Does resolve_args() at line 270 and 307 validate that argument types match expected parameter types, or can type coercion allow incompatible values to be passed? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: signature_token_to_move_type_string_for_wrapper()] [Type Layout] When converting types to strings, can recursive generic types like Struct<Struct<Struct<...>>> cause exponential string size growth leading to memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: signature_token_to_move_type_string_for_wrapper()] [Ability Constraints] At line 450, abilities.display_postfix() formats ability constraints, but can missing or incorrect abilities in generated wrapper scripts bypass Move's ability system? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [BCS Serialization] At lines 387-389, bcs::to_bytes() serializes MoveValue, but can this create ambiguous encodings where the same byte sequence deserializes to different values? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Serialization Size] Does bcs::to_bytes() enforce size limits on serialized arguments, or can extremely large values (e.g., deeply nested vectors) cause unbounded memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Value Lifetime] When ConcreteValue is converted to MoveValue via Into at line 386, are value lifetimes properly managed, or can dangling references be created if ConcreteValue contains borrowed data? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Syntax Choice] At lines 229 and 262, syntax.unwrap_or_else(|| adapter.default_syntax()) selects compilation syntax, but can mismatched syntax between module and script compilation cause incompatibilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Source Line Tracking] The start_line and command_lines_stop parameters passed to compile_module/compile_script are used for error reporting, but can incorrect line numbers cause misleading error messages that hide actual vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Warning Suppression] Compilation warnings are captured but ignored (e.g., _warnings_opt at line 235, 268), but can suppressed warnings about unsafe operations or deprecated features hide security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: generate_script_wrapper_for_non_entry_function()] [Template Injection] The script template at lines 596-611 uses raw string interpolation with format!(), but can crafted identifier names break out of the template structure to inject arbitrary Move code? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: generate_script_wrapper_for_non_entry_function()] [Module Path Validation] At lines 516-518, module address and name are extracted from handles, but are these validated to be syntactically correct Move identifiers before interpolation?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Vec Growth] The operations Vec grows with each task, but is there a maximum size check to prevent memory exhaustion from extremely large task sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Module Storage] Published modules are cloned multiple times (line 238, 242, 246), but can this cause excessive memory usage if modules are very large or contain embedded data?
