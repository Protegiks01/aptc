  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Struct: ProverDependencyInstaller] [Prompt Option Bypass] The PromptOptions at line 66 includes assume_yes flag - can an attacker exploit automated installations with --assume-yes to bypass security prompts that might warn users about suspicious installation locations or version mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Struct: ProverDependencyInstaller] [Install Directory Validation Missing] The install_dir field at line 63 accepts Option<PathBuf> with no visible validation - can an attacker supply malicious paths like '/dev/null', 'CON' (Windows device), or paths with null bytes that cause unexpected behavior in downstream file operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Struct: ProverDependencyInstaller] [PathBuf Parsing Vulnerability] When clap parses the --install-dir argument into a PathBuf at line 63, does it properly sanitize the input to prevent injection of special path characters or encoding attacks like UTF-8 overlong sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: install_binary()] [String Allocation DoS] When constructing DependencyInstaller at lines 189-199 with multiple String::from() conversions, can an attacker supply extremely long strings through CLI arguments to cause memory exhaustion or stack overflow? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Import: set_env crate] [External Dependency Vulnerability] The set_env crate used at line 82 is an external dependency for persisting environment variables - has this dependency been audited for vulnerabilities, and could it be exploited to write malicious data to shell profile files? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Import: cli_build_information] [Build Info Injection] The cli_build_information() function imported at line 5 - if this reads from an external configuration or build artifact, can an attacker inject malicious build information to bypass OS detection checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Return Value Manipulation] The function returns 'Succeeded'.to_string() at line 176 regardless of actual installation success - can partial failures be hidden from the caller, causing them to believe installation succeeded when environment variables weren't properly set? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: install_binary()] [Installer Configuration Injection] When constructing DependencyInstaller with check: false at line 197 and assume_yes: self.prompt_options.assume_yes at line 198, can an attacker manipulate these boolean flags through the CLI to skip safety checks or force automatic approval of dangerous operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: add_env_var()] [Profile Modification Attack] When set_env::set() writes to the user's shell profile at line 82, does it properly escape the path value to prevent injection of malicious shell commands that would execute every time the user opens a new terminal?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/prover_dependencies.rs] [Function: download_dependency()] [Version Format String Attack] When formatting the boogie version string as '{}.0' at line 118, can an attacker exploit Rust's format! macro behavior to cause format string vulnerabilities or unexpected version string interpretation?
