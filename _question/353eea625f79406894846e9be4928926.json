  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenBypasser] [Serialization] If the AuthTokenBypasser is serialized/deserialized for any reason, are the bypass tokens properly protected from exposure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token format assumption] Does the code assume tokens are in a specific format (e.g., alphanumeric), or can tokens containing special characters, unicode, or control characters cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token length validation] Is there a maximum or minimum length enforced for bypass tokens, or can attackers use extremely short or long tokens to bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Authorization scheme] Does the code verify that the Authorization header uses the 'Bearer' scheme specifically, or can other schemes like 'Basic', 'Digest', or custom schemes bypass the check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token prefix matching] Does the contains() check at line 48 perform exact matching, or can attackers use token prefixes or suffixes to bypass authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token enumeration] Can attackers measure response time differences between valid and invalid tokens to enumerate the bypass token list through timing side channels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Error messages] Do error paths return different information than success paths, allowing attackers to distinguish between 'token not found' and 'JWT header present' to map the authorization logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Memory access patterns] Does the HashSet lookup at line 48 have predictable memory access patterns that could leak information about token values through cache timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization timing] Does the initialization time of the AuthTokenBypasser at line 20-27 leak information about the number or complexity of bypass tokens through observable timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Header size attack] Can an attacker send an Authorization header with a massive Bearer token (e.g., gigabytes) to cause memory exhaustion during the to_str() conversion or HashSet lookup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Concurrent request flood] Can attackers send thousands of concurrent requests with different tokens to the request_can_bypass() function to cause CPU exhaustion during HashSet lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Token list bloat] Can an attacker who controls the token file add millions of tokens to cause excessive memory usage and slow HashSet lookups at line 48? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Regex DoS] If the ListManager internally uses regex patterns for token matching, can attackers craft tokens that cause catastrophic backtracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Privilege escalation] If a low-privilege user obtains a bypass token, can they use it to bypass rate limits and drain the faucet, causing denial of service for legitimate users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token sharing] Can bypass tokens be shared between users or reused across multiple accounts, allowing unlimited faucet access and potential fund draining? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Authorization context] Does the bypasser verify that the token is used in the correct context (e.g., IP address, time window), or can stolen tokens be replayed indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Bypass scope] When this bypasser returns true, exactly what checks are bypassed - just auth token checker or ALL checkers including captcha and rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token generation] Are the bypass tokens generated using cryptographically secure random number generators, or can predictable tokens be guessed by attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Token rotation] Is there a mechanism to rotate bypass tokens periodically, or can compromised tokens be used indefinitely until manual intervention? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Hash function security] Does the underlying HashSet use a secure hash function resistant to collision attacks, or can attackers craft colliding tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenBypasser] [Key derivation] If bypass tokens are derived from a master secret, is the derivation function secure against brute force and cryptanalysis attacks? (High)"
