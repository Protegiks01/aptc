  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to notify() with different block timestamps cause out-of-order commit notifications to the coordinator, potentially leading to incorrect batch lifecycle management and state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify()] [Channel Overflow] If the coordinator_tx channel becomes full due to slow processing, does try_send() silently drop commit notifications, causing batches to never be cleaned up and leading to memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify()] [Byzantine Attack] Can a malicious validator flood the coordinator channel with crafted CommitNotification messages by triggering repeated notify() calls, causing legitimate notifications to be dropped and preventing proper batch cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker provide manipulated block_timestamp values that are far in the future or past to disrupt the certified timestamp tracking in batch_reader.update_certified_timestamp()? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify()] [Batch Replay] If the same batches vector is sent multiple times with different timestamps, can this cause double-counting in the coordinator's accounting logic or reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Expiration Bypass] In the expiration check (block_timestamp <= batch_info.expiration()), can a malicious block proposer set block_timestamp to exactly batch_info.expiration() to include expired batches that should be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the block_timestamp parameter to be artificially low, bypassing expiration checks and allowing inclusion of batches that have expired according to actual wall-clock time? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Silent Skip] When expired batches are silently skipped with only a debug log, can this lead to partial transaction execution where some batches succeed and others fail, causing state inconsistencies across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Integer Overflow] If batch_info.expiration() returns u64::MAX and block_timestamp is near u64::MAX, can integer overflow in the comparison lead to incorrect expiration checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_transactions()] [Batch Ordering] Since expired batches are skipped, can the ordering of transactions change between validators if they have slightly different views of the current timestamp, leading to non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_and_wait_transactions()] [Error Propagation] When batch_reader.get_batch() fails for one batch, does the early return with '?' operator cause all subsequent batches to be ignored, leading to partial block execution and state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_and_wait_transactions()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to request_and_wait_transactions() for the same batches cause duplicate transaction fetching and potential memory exhaustion or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_and_wait_transactions()] [DoS Attack] Can a Byzantine validator include batches with extremely large transaction counts that will cause join_all() to consume excessive memory when aggregating results? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_and_wait_transactions()] [Determinism] If futures::future::join_all() doesn't guarantee execution order, can transaction ordering differ between validators, breaking deterministic execution guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: request_and_wait_transactions()] [Deadlock] Can circular dependencies in batch fetching (where batch A depends on batch B and vice versa) cause join_all() to deadlock, halting consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Transaction Duplication] When appending inline_batches transactions to proof_with_data transactions, can duplicate transactions appear if the same batch is included both inline and as a proof, causing double-spending or gas overcharge? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Ordering Violation] Since inline transactions are appended after proof transactions, can this ordering be exploited for MEV attacks where proposers reorder transactions to extract value? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Validation Bypass] Are inline_batches transactions validated for signatures and gas limits, or can malicious proposers include invalid transactions that bypass normal mempool validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Gas Limit Bypass] Can a proposer set block_gas_limit_override to None or an extremely high value to bypass gas limits and cause DoS through expensive transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Transaction Limit Bypass] Can max_txns_to_execute be set to None or u64::MAX to force execution of unlimited transactions, causing validator nodes to run out of resources? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Clone Performance] The comment 'TODO: Can clone be avoided here?' suggests potential performance issues - can repeated cloning of large transaction vectors cause memory exhaustion or performance degradation during block processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: get_transactions_quorum_store_inline_hybrid()] [Payload Version Confusion] Can enable_payload_v2 flag be manipulated or cause inconsistencies where validators with different settings produce different BlockTransactionPayload types, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [Type Confusion] The unreachable!() for DirectMempool suggests this should never occur - can a malicious proposer craft a block with DirectMempool payload to cause panic and crash validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [Batch Duplication] When processing QuorumStoreInlineHybrid payloads, inline_batches are collected first then proof_with_data proofs - can duplicate BatchInfoExt entries be sent to commit_notifier if the same batch appears in both? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/quorum_store_payload_manager.rs] [Function: notify_commit()] [Missing Validation] Does notify_commit() validate that all batches in the payloads vector are actually from the committed block, or can an attacker inject additional batches to manipulate the commit notification?
