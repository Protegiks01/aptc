  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay an old serialized SafetyData from earlier epochs to revert a validator's state and make it vote on conflicting proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Type Confusion] Can deserializing SafetyData with mismatched types (e.g., epoch as string instead of u64) cause panics or undefined behavior in Rust? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Clone Safety] Is the derived Clone implementation deep or shallow for last_vote Option<Vote>, and can shared references cause mutations visible across clones? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Default] [Unsafe Initialization] Does the Default trait create SafetyData with all fields set to 0/None, and if so, can this invalid state (epoch=0) be used in consensus causing safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Default] [Initialization Attack] Can Default::default() be called to reset a validator's SafetyData back to initial state, allowing them to re-vote on old rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Default] [Memory Safety] Is Default::default() used anywhere in consensus hot paths, and can attackers trigger it to wipe safety state mid-consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Default] [State Confusion] Can Default implementation be exploited in error handling paths to revert SafetyData to uninitialized state when storage reads fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Trait: Display] [Information Leakage] Does the Display implementation expose sensitive last_vote details in logs that could reveal validator voting patterns to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Trait: Display] [Log Injection] Can round numbers or epoch values contain special characters that cause log injection attacks when formatted via Display trait? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Trait: Display] [Format String] Is the Display implementation safe from format string vulnerabilities if epoch/round values are attacker-controlled? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Trait: Display] [Information Disclosure] Does Display reveal highest_timeout_round which could help attackers understand validator timeout patterns for liveness attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] Can multiple threads concurrently read and modify SafetyData causing TOCTOU vulnerabilities where last_voted_round is checked then incremented non-atomically? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] If SafetyData is wrapped in Arc<Mutex<SafetyData>>, can lock ordering issues cause deadlocks or can unlocked access windows allow double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] Can epoch transitions race with vote signing, causing a validator to sign votes with mismatched epoch/round combinations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] Is preferred_round update atomic with last_voted_round update, or can races cause one to update while the other is stale? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] Can concurrent timeout certificate signing race with vote signing, causing highest_timeout_round and last_voted_round to desynchronize? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Race Condition] If SafetyData is cloned for concurrent operations, can modifications to one clone affect another through shared Vote references? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Memory Ordering] Does Rust's memory model guarantee visibility of SafetyData field updates across threads without explicit barriers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Atomicity] Can partial updates to SafetyData (updating epoch but not resetting rounds) leave the struct in an inconsistent state visible to concurrent readers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] When epoch increments from N to N+1, are last_voted_round, preferred_round, and one_chain_round properly reset to 0, or can stale round numbers persist across epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] Can a validator process votes for epoch N+1 while SafetyData still has epoch=N, creating cross-epoch equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] During epoch transition, can last_vote from old epoch be incorrectly retained, causing validators to think they voted in the new epoch when they didn't? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] Can epoch be decremented (N+1 → N) through storage corruption, allowing validators to re-vote on old epoch proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] Is there validation that prevents epoch from skipping values (epoch 5 → epoch 7), and can skipped epochs break safety assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Epoch Transition] Can multiple epoch transitions occur rapidly causing epoch to increment faster than SafetyData can be persisted, leading to lost updates? (High)"
