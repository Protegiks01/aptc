  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Handling Integration] [Request Retry Logic] Does the categorization of errors in error.rs properly inform retry logic, or can peers exploit error classifications to force redundant retries of expensive operations, exhausting resources on honest nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Handling Integration] [Fallback Peer Selection] When a peer returns an error, does the client properly fall back to alternative peers with verified data, or could an attacker controlling multiple peers coordinate error responses to force selection of a malicious peer for subsequent requests? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Handling Integration] [Error Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on specific error types to prevent attackers from flooding error logs or metrics with spam, either hiding real attacks or causing resource exhaustion in monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Partial State Corruption] If errors occur mid-way through multi-chunk state synchronization, does error handling ensure atomic rollback of partial state, or could repeated interruptions leave nodes with inconsistent state that appears valid but causes consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Subscription Stream Continuity] When SubscriptionStreamIsLagging errors occur, does recovery logic ensure no gaps or duplicates in the transaction stream, or could attackers exploit stream restarts to cause nodes to miss critical transactions or process them multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Recovery] [Epoch Transition Errors] If errors occur during critical epoch transitions when validator sets change, does error handling ensure nodes either complete or fully abort the transition, or could partial transitions leave nodes in an inconsistent epoch state causing fork risks? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: TimeoutWaitingForResponse] [Adaptive Timeout Manipulation] Can malicious peers learn and exploit timeout thresholds by responding just under the timeout limit to maximize resource consumption while avoiding timeout penalties, effectively slow-draining honest node resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: TimeoutWaitingForResponse] [Cascading Timeout Failures] Can coordinated timeout attacks on multiple nodes trigger cascading failures where timeouts beget more timeouts as the network becomes congested, leading to network-wide state-sync failure and liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: TimeoutWaitingForResponse] [Timeout Inconsistency] Do all nodes use consistent timeout values for requests, or could timeout configuration differences cause honest nodes to timeout valid requests from each other, fragmenting the network into isolated clusters? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: DataIsUnavailable] [Eclipse Attack Vector] Can attackers force DataIsUnavailable errors by eclipsing a node's peer connections, ensuring it only connects to malicious peers that claim data is unavailable, preventing the node from ever synchronizing with the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: DataIsUnavailable] [Censorship Attack] Could colluding validators selectively return DataIsUnavailable for specific transactions or accounts, enabling targeted censorship that appears as benign network errors rather than malicious filtering? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: DataIsUnavailable] [Historical Data Pruning] If nodes legitimately prune old state and return DataIsUnavailable for historical queries, can attackers exploit this to prevent new nodes from bootstrapping by forcing them to request unavailable historical data repeatedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidRequest] [Request Fuzzing] Can attackers systematically fuzz request parameters to discover which invalid requests trigger what error responses, building a map of validation logic to find bypasses or exploit validation gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidRequest] [Validation Inconsistency] Do all nodes validate requests consistently, or could request validation differences cause some nodes to reject as InvalidRequest what other nodes accept, leading to network fragmentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidRequest] [Version Compatibility] Can version mismatches between nodes cause valid requests from newer clients to be rejected as InvalidRequest by older peers, preventing protocol upgrades and creating hard forks? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidResponse] [Proof Verification] When InvalidResponse is returned, has cryptographic proof verification already occurred, or could malicious responses with valid signatures but invalid content bypass initial checks and trigger InvalidResponse only after partial processing? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidResponse] [Response Ordering] Can attackers send responses in unexpected orders (e.g., chunk N before chunk N-1) that trigger InvalidResponse errors but leave client state machines in inconsistent states, preventing recovery even with valid retries? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: InvalidResponse] [Equivocation Detection] If a peer sends different responses to the same request to different nodes (equivocation), does InvalidResponse handling include equivocation detection and slashing, or can peers equivocate without penalty? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: NoConnectedPeers] [Bootstrap Vulnerability] Can attackers target nodes during initial bootstrap when they have no connected peers, forcing them into permanent NoConnectedPeers state by blocking all peer discovery mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: NoConnectedPeers] [Peer Rotation Attack] Can attackers force churn in peer connections to repeatedly trigger NoConnectedPeers errors, preventing stable state-sync sessions and keeping nodes perpetually out of sync? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Error Type: NoConnectedPeers] [Redundancy Failure] Does the system maintain sufficient peer redundancy such that transient network issues cannot cause NoConnectedPeers, or can localized network problems cascade into complete isolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Cross-Variant Attacks] [Error Type Confusion] Can attackers trigger sequences of different error types (e.g., TimeoutWaitingForResponse followed by InvalidResponse followed by DataIsUnavailable) that together exploit state machine vulnerabilities in error recovery logic, even though each individual error is handled correctly? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Cross-Variant Attacks] [Error Amplification] Can a single malicious action trigger multiple cascading errors across different error types, amplifying the impact and potentially overwhelming error handling systems or causing unexpected state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Cross-Variant Attacks] [Error Correlation] Does error handling properly correlate related errors across multiple requests/responses, or can attackers exploit independent error handling to obscure coordinated attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/error.rs] [Type Alias: Result<T, E = Error>] [Error Propagation] Is the Result type alias with default Error consistently used throughout the codebase, or could inconsistent error types in some paths bypass centralized error handling logic? (Low)"
