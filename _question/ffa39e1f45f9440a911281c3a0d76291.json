  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [StructTag] [Canonical Representation] At line 142, to_canonical_string() is called on StructTag - is this representation unique for all distinct StructTags, or can different tags have the same canonical string? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [StructTag] [Ordering Stability] Since StructTag is used as a BTreeMap key at line 73, is its Ord implementation stable across Rust versions and platforms? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Function: squash()] [Modify Chain] Can a long chain of Modify operations (Modify1 -> Modify2 -> ... -> ModifyN) cause performance degradation or stack overflow during squashing? (Medium)",
