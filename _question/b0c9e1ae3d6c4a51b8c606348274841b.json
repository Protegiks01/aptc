  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint_from_config()] [Type confusion] Can attackers exploit the function returning None for non-FromConfig variants to bypass waypoint checks in calling code that doesn't properly handle the Option type? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Panic DoS] The function uses panic! for missing waypoint files - can an attacker trigger this by deleting/renaming the waypoint file between validation and access, causing validator nodes to crash and disrupting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [File read DoS] The function uses unwrap_or_else with panic for file read errors - can attackers exploit filesystem issues (permissions, I/O errors, race conditions) to crash all validators simultaneously causing total network liveness failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [TOCTOU file race] Between the exists() check and fs::read_to_string(), can an attacker replace the waypoint file with a malicious one (or delete it), causing either a crash or injection of an invalid waypoint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Waypoint parsing injection] The Waypoint::from_str() uses content.trim() but then unwrap_or_else with panic - can carefully crafted whitespace or special characters bypass parsing to either inject malicious waypoints or cause crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Storage key hardcoding] The function uses aptos_global_constants::WAYPOINT as storage key - if this constant is predictable or leaked, can attackers manipulate storage backends to inject malicious waypoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Storage backend authentication] When converting SecureBackend into Storage, is authentication properly enforced, or can unauthenticated attackers read/write waypoint values to redirect nodes to malicious chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Storage read failure] The .expect('Unable to read waypoint') will panic on storage failures - can an attacker cause storage backend unavailability to crash all validators simultaneously, causing total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Final expect panic] The final .expect('waypoint should be present') at line 109 can panic if waypoint is None - despite earlier checks, can race conditions or variant confusion reach this code path causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Concurrent access] If multiple threads call waypoint() concurrently on the same WaypointConfig::FromFile, can file access race conditions cause inconsistent waypoint values across threads leading to consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [File size attack] Does the fs::read_to_string() have size limits, or can an attacker provide a multi-gigabyte waypoint file causing memory exhaustion and validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Symlink following] When reading from waypoint_path, does Rust's fs module follow symlinks? Can an attacker use symlinks to redirect waypoint reads to files they control or sensitive system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Path canonicalization] Is waypoint_path canonicalized before checking exists() and reading? Can attackers use relative paths or '..' sequences to read waypoints from unexpected locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Error message exposure] The panic messages include file paths and error details - does this information disclosure help attackers understand filesystem structure or identify vulnerable paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: genesis_waypoint()] [Genesis waypoint substitution] For FromStorage variant, this reads from GENESIS_WAYPOINT constant - can attackers manipulate storage to provide a different genesis waypoint than the actual network genesis, causing chain fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: genesis_waypoint()] [Fallback to regular waypoint] For non-FromStorage variants, genesis_waypoint() calls self.waypoint() - can this lead to using current waypoint instead of actual genesis, breaking state sync or historical validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: genesis_waypoint()] [Storage backend consistency] If FromStorage backend stores both WAYPOINT and GENESIS_WAYPOINT, is there validation ensuring GENESIS_WAYPOINT is actually the genesis and not a later waypoint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: genesis_waypoint()] [Panic propagation] Since genesis_waypoint() can call waypoint() which has multiple panic points, can attackers crash validators by corrupting genesis waypoint data during node initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: genesis_waypoint()] [Expect without context] The .expect('Unable to read waypoint') at line 118 doesn't specify it's reading genesis_waypoint - can this cause confusion during incident response when validators crash? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: RoleType] [Role escalation] Can a node deserialize a config with RoleType::Validator even if it lacks validator keys, stake, or authorization, allowing unauthorized participation in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: RoleType] [Role downgrade attack] Can an attacker modify a running validator's config to change role from Validator to FullNode during epoch transition, removing them from consensus without proper governance approval? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: RoleType] [Serde rename_all] The serde(rename_all = 'snake_case') attribute changes serialization format - can inconsistencies between config formats allow role confusion during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Enum: RoleType] [PoemEnum exposure] The PoemEnum derive exposes role types through API - can external attackers enumerate node roles to identify and target validator nodes for attack? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: is_validator()] [Access control bypass] If is_validator() is used for authorization decisions, can logic errors or race conditions allow FullNode role to return true, granting unauthorized validator privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Function: is_validator()] [Comparison timing] Does the equality comparison self == RoleType::Validator have constant-time characteristics, or can timing attacks leak role information? (Low)"
