  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Config Injection] If config files are read from untrusted sources or environment variables, can attackers inject malicious configurations through compromised config management systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field defaults] [Serde Default Bypass] Can attackers intentionally omit poll_interval_seconds or poll_rows_limit from config to force fallback to defaults, potentially bypassing operator-intended limits or protections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_interval_seconds] [Arithmetic Overflow] When poll_interval_seconds is used in Duration::from_secs(), can u64::MAX cause panic or undefined behavior in time-based calculations throughout the application? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_rows_limit] [SQL Injection Prep] When poll_rows_limit is used in SQL LIMIT clauses, does the i64 cast properly handle edge cases, or can extreme values cause query malformation or unexpected database behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Function: default_poll_rows_limit] [Const Overflow] Is there any risk that const fn default_poll_rows_limit returning 600 could be misused in arithmetic operations that overflow when combined with other large config values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Race Condition] When AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig is cloned and shared across threads, can concurrent modifications to the config (if mutable) cause data races or inconsistent state between polling and upload loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Config Reload] If the config is reloaded at runtime without proper synchronization, can stale config values be read by worker threads, causing CDN URL mismatches or worker URI connection failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix + cloudflare_account_hash] [URL Format String] When concatenating cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix, cloudflare_account_hash, image ID, and cloudflare_default_variant, can special characters in these fields break the URL format (e.g., unescaped spaces, newlines, null bytes)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix] [Open Redirect] Can manipulating cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix to include redirect directives (e.g., @redirect=evil.com) cause CDN URLs to redirect users to phishing sites when they access NFT images? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_hash] [Cross-Account Access] If cloudflare_account_hash is incorrectly configured to another account's hash, could this cause uploads to be stored under the wrong Cloudflare account, leading to data leakage or unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information Leakage] Does the Debug trait implementation expose sensitive config values (cloudflare_account_hash, asset_uploader_worker_uri) in error messages or panic traces that could be logged or displayed to unauthorized users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Config Exposure] When AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig is serialized (e.g., for monitoring/debugging), are sensitive Cloudflare credentials inadvertently exposed in API responses, metrics, or health check endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Function: default_poll_interval_seconds] [Timing Attack] Is the 10-second default poll interval predictable enough for attackers to time database state changes and exploit race conditions in the asset upload queue? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Function: default_poll_rows_limit] [Queue Backlog] If the default 600 rows limit is too small for high-traffic NFT projects, could this create a persistent backlog where legitimate uploads are never processed, effectively causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig] [Config Tampering] Are there access controls preventing unauthorized modification of the config file or environment variables, or can any process with file system access change critical parameters like worker URI or Cloudflare settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: asset_uploader_worker_uri] [Worker Impersonation] If asset_uploader_worker_uri can be changed by attackers, could they redirect all uploads to a malicious worker that steals NFT asset data before forwarding to the real Cloudflare API? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Import: serde] [Dependency Vulnerability] Could vulnerabilities in serde deserialization (e.g., stack overflow, memory corruption) be triggered through maliciously crafted config files fed to AssetUploaderThrottlerConfig? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone Safety] When cloning config with String fields, are there any unsafe memory operations or potential double-free vulnerabilities if the underlying allocator is compromised? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_hash] [Account Enumeration] Can different cloudflare_account_hash values be tested to enumerate valid Cloudflare accounts or probe for accounts with weak security configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_default_variant] [Variant Abuse] If cloudflare_default_variant is set to expensive transformation variants (e.g., high-resolution, multiple formats), could this cause excessive Cloudflare API costs or rate limiting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_rows_limit] [SQL Performance] When poll_rows_limit is very large, could the resulting SQL query (ORDER BY + LIMIT N) cause table locks, index issues, or query timeout problems in high-concurrency scenarios?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/throttler/config.rs] [Field: poll_interval_seconds] [Connection Pool Exhaustion] Can rapid polling (low poll_interval_seconds) combined with slow database queries cause connection pool exhaustion, preventing other services from accessing the database?
