  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Protocol: Handshake] [Version downgrade] Can attackers advertise old handshake versions to force validators into using outdated, potentially vulnerable protocol versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Protocol: Handshake] [Version mismatch handling] When two validators advertise incompatible handshake versions, is there a fallback mechanism, or does connection simply fail? Can this be exploited for targeted DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Function: rotate_noise_public_key()] [Distributed rotation] When validators rotate keys using lines 408-422, how is this synchronized across the network? Can inconsistent rotation timing cause network splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Function: rotate_noise_public_key()] [Old key retention] After rotation, are old keys retained for a grace period? If not, can rapid rotation cause existing connections to break before new ones are established? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Function: Display::fmt()] [Sensitive data exposure] At lines 515-521, addresses are formatted for display. Are NoiseIK public keys considered sensitive? Can logging addresses expose validator identities to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Function: Debug::fmt()] [Debug info leakage] At lines 524-527, Debug uses Display. In debug builds, can additional information be exposed that helps attackers fingerprint validator software? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/network_address/mod.rs] [Function: to_string() via Display] [Non-canonical forms] Can the same semantic address be represented in multiple string forms (e.g., IPv6 with/without zero compression)? Can this break signature verification or address comparisons? (High)"
