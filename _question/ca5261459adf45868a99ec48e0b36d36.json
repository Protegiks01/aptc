  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_proposal()] [Conditional compilation bypass] The function is behind `#[cfg(feature =",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_epoch_change()] [Self-only restriction] Why does epoch change send only to self.author? Can this design cause epoch transitions to fail if self-messages are dropped? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_commit_proof()] [Commit proof validation] Before sending commit proof to self, is the LedgerInfoWithSignatures fully validated including all signatures and quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_commit_proof()] [Error suppression] The result is discarded with `let _ =` - can failures to send commit proof to self cause validators to miss committed blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_commit_proof()] [Timeout sufficiency] Is 500ms timeout sufficient for self-RPC during high load, or can timeout failures cause validators to lose track of committed state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: author()] [Author immutability] Is the author field truly immutable after construction, or can unsafe code or interior mutability allow author tampering? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency measurement manipulation] Can Byzantine validators manipulate latency measurements (e.g., selective responsiveness) to ensure they always receive messages first? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Sorting stability] If latencies are equal, does the sort maintain original order, or can sorting instability cause non-deterministic message ordering across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: request_batch()] [Digest verification bypass] Can an attacker return a batch that passes verify_with_digest but contains invalid transactions, exploiting incomplete verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: request_batch()] [Response type downgrade] Can attackers force the deprecated BatchResponse path instead of BatchResponseV2 to bypass newer security checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: request_batch()] [NotFound exploitation] When receiving BatchResponse::NotFound(ledger_info), the comment says it's verified later - can this delayed verification window be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: request_batch()] [Version confusion] The TODO comment mentions v1.11 deprecation - can version mismatches during migration cause batch validation bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_signed_batch_info_msg()] [Signature verification] Are all signatures in SignedBatchInfo verified before sending, or can Byzantine validators propagate invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_signed_batch_info_msg_v2()] [Version migration attack] Can attackers exploit differences between v1 and v2 batch info formats to cause inconsistent batch processing across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_signed_batch_info_msg()] [Recipient filtering] Does the function verify recipients are valid validators, or can batch info be sent to non-validators potentially leaking consensus data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: broadcast_batch_msg()] [Batch size limits] Are there limits on batch vector size, or can attackers broadcast massive batch vectors causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: broadcast_batch_msg_v2()] [BatchInfoExt validation] Does BatchInfoExt contain additional fields that require validation before broadcasting, or can malformed extended info be propagated? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: broadcast_proof_of_store_msg_v2()] [Proof replay] Can old proof-of-store messages be replayed in later epochs, causing validators to incorrectly accept outdated batch commitments? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network.rs] [Function: send_proof_of_store_msg_to_self()] [Self-send atomicity] If self-sending proof-of-store fails, does this prevent the validator from participating in consensus for those batches? (High)",
