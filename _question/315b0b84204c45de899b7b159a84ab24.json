  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Error Message Injection] Can an attacker inject control characters or ANSI escape sequences in package names/paths that corrupt error output and potentially hide attack indicators? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Async Cancellation] If the async resolve() operation is cancelled mid-execution, does it leave the package_lock or cache in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Concurrent Resolution] Can multiple concurrent calls to resolve() for different packages cause race conditions in shared state (package_cache, package_lock)? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Await Point Vulnerabilities] At each await point (lines 168, 193, 202, 212, 233, 297, 390, 440), can the state change in unexpected ways causing TOCTOU vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Async Recursion Stack] Does the use of Box::pin for recursive async calls (line 286) provide sufficient protection against stack overflow in deep dependency trees, or can it still be exhausted? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Address Substitution TODO] Line 26 mentions 'Addr subst' as a TODO - when implemented, could address substitution be exploited to replace legitimate addresses with attacker-controlled ones? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Same Package Name TODO] Line 27 indicates plans to 'Allow same package name' - when relaxed, will this introduce dependency confusion or namespace collision vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Dependency Override TODO] Line 28 mentions 'Dep override' - could this feature be exploited to override security-critical dependencies with malicious versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Transitive OnChain Deps TODO] Line 29 states 'Fetch transitive deps for on-chain packages' is missing - does this create a security gap where on-chain packages can have unvetted transitive dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Symbolic Links TODO] Line 31 mentions '(Low Priority) Symbolic links in git repos' - are symbolic links currently not handled, allowing potential security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Parallel Resolution TODO] Line 32 mentions '(Low Priority) Resolve deps in parallel' - when implemented, will this introduce new race conditions or concurrent access vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Windows Path Handling] Are Windows-specific path formats (backslashes, drive letters, UNC paths) properly handled in all path operations, or can they bypass Unix-oriented security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Filesystem Case Sensitivity] Do the package identity and path comparisons account for case-insensitive filesystems (Windows, macOS) vs case-sensitive (Linux), or can this be exploited for collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Line Ending Confusion] Can an attacker exploit differences in line endings (CRLF vs LF) in manifest files to inject content or bypass parsing validation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [PackageCache Trust] The resolver trusts the PackageCache implementation - can a compromised or malicious PackageCacheListener inject backdoors during fetch operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Manifest Parser Trust] The resolver trusts move_package_manifest::parse_package_manifest - are there known vulnerabilities in the manifest parser that could be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Graph Library Trust] The resolver uses petgraph library - are there known vulnerabilities in the petgraph version used that could be exploited through crafted graphs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Package Name Validation] Are package names validated against a whitelist of allowed characters, or can special characters, spaces, or control characters in names cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [URL Validation] Are git and node URLs validated against a proper URL spec, or can malformed URLs cause parsing errors or injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Path Component Validation] Are individual path components validated to prevent special names like '.' or '..' from being used in unexpected ways? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Commit ID Format] Is the git commit_id validated to be a proper SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash, or can arbitrary strings be passed that could exploit git operations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Address Format Validation] For on-chain packages, is package_addr validated against the Aptos address format (0x + 64 hex chars), or can malformed addresses cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [File Handle Exhaustion] If resolution involves many packages, can the number of open file handles (for reading Move.toml files) exceed system limits causing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Network Connection Limits] Can resolving many remote packages exhaust network connection limits, causing denial-of-service? (Low)",
