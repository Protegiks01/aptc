  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Configuration] [Mutable configuration attack] Can node_config be modified during initialization (note: &mut NodeConfig in create_dkg_runtime and create_jwk_consensus_runtime), allowing attackers to inject malicious configuration mid-setup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Configuration] [Consensus config isolation] Are consensus configuration parameters properly isolated from DKG and JWK configurations, or can configuration mixing cause protocol violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Configuration] [Safety rules tampering] Can safety_rules in node_config.consensus be modified between different function calls, causing inconsistent safety enforcement across subsystems? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Configuration] [Observer/publisher config race] Can consensus_observer configuration be modified between the is_observer_or_publisher_enabled() check and actual observer/publisher creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Error handling] [Expect panics] Do the multiple .expect() calls throughout the file properly handle all edge cases, or can they be triggered by attackers to crash validator nodes causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Error handling] [Unwrap panics] Does validator_network.as_ref().unwrap() properly handle missing validator network configuration, or can unwrap panics crash nodes during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] If services::start_consensus_runtime() or other start functions fail silently, can validators continue running in degraded states without proper error reporting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Error handling] [Partial initialization] If one of the creation functions fails midway, can the validator be left in a partially initialized state that behaves unpredictably? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Error handling] [Runtime spawn failures] Are runtime spawn failures properly detected and handled, or can failed spawns go unnoticed leaving critical consensus components not running? (High)"
