  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Propagation] Does the async execute() method properly sanitize error messages before returning them to the CLI user, or could sensitive Rosetta API error details (internal IPs, stack traces, database paths) leak through anyhow::Result propagation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: execute()] [Command Injection] Can malicious subcommand implementations in account, block, construction, or network modules inject commands or cause unintended state changes when called through the execute() dispatcher? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does execute() have any timeout or resource limits when awaiting subcommand results, or could a malicious Rosetta server cause the CLI to hang indefinitely consuming client resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: format_output()] [Panic on Serialization] The unwrap() call on serde_json::to_string_pretty() can panic - could malicious or malformed data from the Rosetta API cause serialization failures that crash the CLI instead of returning proper errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: format_output()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does format_output() have size limits on the JSON output, or could an attacker cause the Rosetta API to return extremely large responses that exhaust client memory during pretty-printing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: format_output()] [Information Disclosure] Does format_output() properly redact sensitive information (private keys, passwords, auth tokens) that might be present in generic Serialize types before converting to JSON strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: format_output()] [Encoding Issues] Can malicious UTF-8 sequences in Rosetta API responses bypass JSON encoding and cause terminal injection attacks when output is displayed to users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: UrlArgs] [SSRF via URL] Does the rosetta_api_url accept arbitrary URLs including file://, data://, or internal network addresses that could enable Server-Side Request Forgery attacks against localhost or internal services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: UrlArgs] [Default URL Security] The default value http://localhost:8082 uses HTTP not HTTPS - does this expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks when they don't explicitly specify a secure URL? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: client()] [URL Validation] Does client() validate the URL scheme, or could malicious URLs with javascript:, data:, or other non-HTTP schemes cause unexpected behavior in the RosettaClient? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: client()] [Connection Security] Does the RosettaClient created by client() enforce TLS certificate validation, or could attackers perform MITM attacks by presenting invalid certificates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: UrlArgs] [URL Parsing Vulnerabilities] Can malformed URLs with unusual characters, extremely long hostnames, or parser-confusing patterns cause url::Url parsing to fail unsafely or leak memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: NetworkArgs] [ChainId Confusion] The default chain_id uses ChainId::test() - could users accidentally execute mainnet operations on testnet by relying on defaults, potentially losing funds or causing irreversible state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: network_identifier()] [ChainId Validation] Does network_identifier() validate that the ChainId is a known/supported Aptos network, or could arbitrary chain IDs cause the Rosetta API to interact with unintended networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: network_request()] [Request Forgery] Can malicious users craft NetworkRequest objects with mismatched network_identifier values that cause the Rosetta API to execute operations on different chains than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: NetworkArgs] [Cross-Chain Attacks] Does the CLI prevent users from accidentally mixing mainnet private keys with testnet transactions by validating chain_id consistency across operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: NetworkArgs] [ChainId Parsing] Can malicious command-line inputs for chain_id cause integer overflows, panics, or undefined behavior during ChainId parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Integer Overflow] The block_index is Option<u64> - can extremely large block numbers cause overflow issues in downstream Rosetta API calls or database queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Hash Validation] Does the block_hash String undergo any validation (hex format, length checks), or can arbitrary strings cause the Rosetta API to perform expensive invalid hash lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [SQL Injection via Hash] If block_hash is used in database queries without proper sanitization, could malicious hash strings enable SQL injection attacks against the Rosetta server's backend? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: From<BlockArgs> for Option<PartialBlockIdentifier>] [Logic Bug] The conversion returns None only when both block_index and block_hash are None - could this cause ambiguity when both are provided simultaneously, potentially returning wrong blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Resource Exhaustion] Can requesting blocks with keep_all_transactions=true cause the CLI or Rosetta API to load massive amounts of transaction data into memory, leading to OOM crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Block Hash Spoofing] Does the system verify that the provided block_hash actually corresponds to the requested block_index, or could mismatched values cause the CLI to process incorrect block data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Negative Block Numbers] Although block_index is u64 (unsigned), can command-line parsing accept negative numbers that get silently converted or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: ErrorWrapper] [Information Disclosure] Does ErrorWrapper.error properly sanitize error messages to prevent leaking sensitive information like database connection strings, file paths, or internal API keys? (Medium)"
