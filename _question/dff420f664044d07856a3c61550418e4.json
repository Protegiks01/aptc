  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Edge case] [Genesis state] During genesis, when state is empty, does get_account_sequence_number() handle missing AccountResources correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [DoS] [Lock contention] Can an attacker submit transactions that take very long to validate, holding locks and preventing other transactions from being validated? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [DoS] [Cache thrashing] Can an attacker submit transactions that cause continuous cache invalidation forcing expensive reset_all() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [DoS] [Panic flooding] Can an attacker flood validators with transactions that consistently panic, causing all pool members to have poisoned mutexes? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Integration] [Mempool coordination] How does VMValidator coordinate with mempool - can accepted transactions be removed from mempool before commit causing revalidation? (Medium)",

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Race condition] [notify_commit vs validate] Can notify_commit() execute between acquiring validator lock and starting validation, causing wrong state to be used? (Critical)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Race condition] [restart vs validate] Can restart() execute while validate_transaction() is holding a lock, causing inconsistent state views? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Race condition] [Multiple notifies] Can multiple notify_commit() calls race, causing some state updates to be lost? (High)",

  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Memory safety] [Double free] Can panic during validation cause double-free when unwinding through locks and Arc drops? (High)",
  "[File: vm-validator/src/vm_validator.rs] [Type safety] [Type confusion] Can Move type system bugs cause validation to accept transactions that would fail execution? (Critical)",
