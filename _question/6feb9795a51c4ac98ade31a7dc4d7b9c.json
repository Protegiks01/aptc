  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Side effects: none] [Audit logging] Can the absence of audit logging in FakeFunder hide missing security logging in production funders, preventing detection of suspicious funding patterns or unauthorized access attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Side effects: none] [Metrics collection] Does FakeFunder not updating metrics prevent testing of monitoring and alerting logic, potentially hiding production issues where funders fail silently without triggering alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [State: stateless] [Sequence tracking] Can FakeFunder's stateless design hide sequence number management bugs in production funders that must track and increment transaction sequence numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Struct: FakeFunderConfig] [Configuration validation] Does FakeFunderConfig being an empty struct with no validation prevent early detection of misconfiguration errors that would only manifest at runtime in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Build: conditional compilation] Can FakeFunder be compiled into production binaries due to lack of #[cfg(test)] or feature flag guards, increasing attack surface by including test-only code in production releases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Build: dead code] Does the compiler not eliminating FakeFunder from production builds indicate it may be reachable through runtime configuration, creating risk of accidental deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [API: fund endpoint] Can API endpoints using FakeFunder return HTTP 200 success responses with empty transaction data, causing client confusion or breaking API contract expectations about response structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [API: healthcheck] Does FakeFunder always reporting healthy through the default is_healthy() implementation prevent testing of healthcheck failure scenarios and service degradation handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [API: rate limiting] Can FakeFunder bypassing actual funding operations hide rate limiting bugs in production where rate limits should apply per address or per asset? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [API: response caching] Does FakeFunder's deterministic behavior enable aggressive response caching that would be incorrect for production funders with dynamic balance checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Error: AptosTapError variants] Can the lack of error returns in FakeFunder prevent exhaustive testing of all AptosTapError variants defined in the errors module, leaving error handling code paths untested? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Error: error context] Does FakeFunder never adding error context prevent testing of error context propagation and structured error logging that should help debug production issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Error: retry logic] Can the absence of transient errors from FakeFunder hide incorrect retry logic in API handlers that should implement exponential backoff for temporary failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Ownership: self reference] Can the &self reference in fund() and get_amount() hide ownership bugs in production funders that need mutable access to update internal state like transaction counters or balance tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Lifetime: 'static bound] Does the 'static lifetime bound on FunderTrait prevent testing of funders with borrowed data, potentially hiding lifetime-related bugs in complex production implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Clone: derive] Can FakeFunderConfig deriving Clone without any internal state hide bugs in production configs where cloning should deep-copy mutable state or increment reference counts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Documentation: missing warnings] Does the lack of documentation warnings about FakeFunder being test-only increase risk of accidental production deployment by developers unfamiliar with the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Documentation: contract violations] Can missing documentation about FakeFunder violating normal funder contracts cause developers to incorrectly assume it has production-equivalent behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Security: test data exposure] Can FakeFunder being used in integration tests expose test private keys, addresses, or configuration to production systems if test and production configurations are not properly isolated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Security: access control] Does FakeFunder lacking any access control checks prevent testing of authorization logic, potentially hiding privilege escalation bugs where unauthorized users can request funding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Security: audit trail] Can the absence of audit logging in FakeFunder hide compliance requirements for audit trails that production funders must maintain for regulatory or security purposes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Security: cryptographic operations] Does FakeFunder never performing signature generation or verification hide bugs in key management, signature schemes, or cryptographic parameter validation? (Low)"
