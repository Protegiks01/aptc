  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_EXECUTION_BOUND] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker craft Move unit tests that intentionally consume exactly 1,000,000 gas units to maximize execution time without hitting the limit, creating a time-based DoS when running test suites across multiple files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_EXECUTION_BOUND] [Integer overflow] Is the DEFAULT_EXECUTION_BOUND value of 1_000_000 sufficient to prevent integer overflow when multiplied by the number of concurrent tests in TestRunner, potentially causing memory corruption or panic during gas accounting? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Input validation] Does the filter field (line 38) validate regex patterns, or can an attacker provide a malicious regex that causes catastrophic backtracking, leading to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) when filtering test names? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Resource exhaustion] Can the num_threads field (line 51) be set to an arbitrarily large value (e.g., u64::MAX) causing memory exhaustion through excessive thread pool allocation in TestRunner initialization? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Path traversal] Do the dep_files (line 60) and source_files (line 95) fields validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd') that could expose sensitive system files during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Path traversal] Can an attacker use symbolic links in dep_files or source_files to bypass path validation and compile arbitrary Move code from outside the intended project directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Command injection] Are the source_files and dep_files paths properly sanitized before being passed to the Move compiler, or could shell metacharacters in filenames lead to command injection if the compiler invokes external tools? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Integer overflow] Is the num_threads value (default 8, line 47) checked for overflow when multiplied by per-thread memory allocations, potentially causing memory corruption in the rayon thread pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Memory exhaustion] Can setting num_threads to 0 cause a panic or undefined behavior in TestRunner initialization, potentially crashing the test execution framework? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Address injection] Do the named_address_values (line 88) properly validate NumericalAddress format to prevent injection of malformed addresses that could cause compiler crashes or incorrect bytecode generation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Logic error] Can the ignore_compile_warnings flag (line 79) be exploited to hide critical security warnings (e.g., integer overflow, unsafe operations) that should fail tests, allowing vulnerable code to pass testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Struct: UnitTestingConfig] [Race condition] If multiple threads modify the same UnitTestingConfig instance concurrently, could race conditions in the filter or named_address_values fields lead to inconsistent test execution or compiler state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_module_id()] [Format string injection] Can a malicious ModuleId with specially crafted name or address cause format string vulnerabilities or buffer overflows when constructing the output string '0x{}::{}'? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_module_id()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a ModuleId with an extremely long module name (e.g., millions of characters) causing excessive memory allocation during string formatting and potential OOM crashes?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_module_id()] [Information disclosure] Does short_str_lossless() properly handle address truncation, or could it expose partial addresses that leak information about private key patterns or address generation schemes? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Implementation: Default::default()] [Security misconfiguration] Does the default num_threads value of 8 (line 118) create a security risk on systems with limited CPU cores, potentially causing thread starvation or scheduler thrashing that affects consensus validators running unit tests? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Implementation: Default::default()] [Security bypass] Is the default report_stacktrace_on_abort value of true (line 121) a security risk that could leak sensitive memory contents or internal implementation details through stack traces in production test environments? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Implementation: Default::default()] [Missing validation] Does the Default implementation validate that empty vectors for source_files and dep_files (lines 123-124) prevent accidental test execution with no code, which could give false positive test results? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_named_addresses()] [Assertion failure] Can the assert on line 138 be triggered in production code if this method is called twice, causing a panic that crashes test execution and prevents security audits from completing?
