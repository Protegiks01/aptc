  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [AutoGenerated check bypass] The pattern match only handles IdentitySource::AutoGenerated - can an attacker provide IdentitySource::FromFile or IdentitySource::FromStorage to bypass the key persistence logic and cause the node to regenerate identity keys on every restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [Race condition on file operations] Between Identity::load_identity() and Identity::save_private_key(), can concurrent node instances or attackers create race conditions that cause identity key corruption or replacement with malicious keys? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [NetworkId comparison] The check fullnode_network_config.network_id == NetworkId::Public uses direct comparison - can an attacker define a custom NetworkId that matches Public through Eq trait implementation to bypass the public network optimization? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [Seed peer override persistence] If an attacker provides malicious seeds in local config, the function skips optimization but doesn't validate the provided seeds - can this allow connection to malicious peers that could perform eclipse attacks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [Error handling inconsistency] If create_seed_peers() returns an error, the function propagates it but doesn't clean up partially modified config - can this leave the node in an inconsistent state with some networks having seeds and others not? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_public_network_config()] [Multiple public networks] If there are multiple NetworkId::Public networks in full_node_networks, does the function correctly handle all of them, or can ordering cause some to be skipped and remain without seed peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [None validator network] If validator_network is None for a NodeType::Validator, does the function return false (no changes) allowing a validator to start without any validator network configured, which would completely isolate it from consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [Network ID override] The function forcibly sets network_id to NetworkId::Validator - can an attacker prevent this by setting the value in local_config_yaml to bypass the check at line 252, allowing validators to use public network IDs for consensus traffic? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [Mutual authentication bypass] Can an attacker set mutual_authentication=false in local_config_yaml to bypass the line 258-260 check, allowing validators to accept unauthenticated connections from any peer claiming to be a validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [YAML key variation] Does the check use the exact string 'validator_network_config' or can variations like 'validator_network' or 'validatorNetworkConfig' bypass the null check and prevent proper configuration? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [Unused parameters] The _node_type and _chain_id parameters are unused - can this indicate missing validation that should verify only NodeType::Validator nodes have validator_network configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [Partial override inconsistency] If local_config_yaml sets network_id but not mutual_authentication, does the function end up with an inconsistent state where the network uses a custom ID but has mutual auth enabled, potentially breaking validator network topology? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize_validator_network_config()] [Return value correctness] If both network_id and mutual_authentication are already set in local_config_yaml, does the function correctly return false, or does modified_config tracking have bugs that report true incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: create_seed_peers()] [Empty seed set] If seed_peer_entries is empty, does the function return an empty HashMap or an error? Can an empty seed set cause nodes to fail to connect to the network, leading to loss of liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: create_seed_peers()] [Duplicate peer IDs] If multiple entries have the same account_address, does the HashMap.insert() silently overwrite earlier entries, potentially allowing an attacker to replace legitimate seeds with malicious ones by exploiting entry ordering? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: create_seed_peers()] [Error propagation] If build_seed_peer() fails for one entry, does the function stop immediately and return an error, or can partial seed sets be created that leave nodes with incomplete peer lists? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: create_seed_peers()] [HashMap capacity] Is the HashMap pre-allocated with the correct capacity, or can repeated insertions cause reallocation thrashing that leads to DoS during node startup? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: create_seed_peers()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide seed_peer_entries with incorrect tuple types (e.g., swapping public_key and network_address) that pass type checking but create invalid peer configurations? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Hex parsing bypass] Can an attacker provide account_address_hex with malformed hex (e.g., '0x' prefix variations, mixed case, extra characters) that either bypasses validation or causes parsing to succeed with unexpected addresses? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Public key validation] Does x25519::PublicKey::from_encoded_string() validate the key is on the curve and not a low-order point? Can weak public keys be injected to enable MITM attacks on the noise protocol connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Network address injection] Can an attacker provide malicious network_address_str values (e.g., internal IPs like 127.0.0.1, or URLs instead of proper /dns/ addresses) to redirect nodes to attacker-controlled infrastructure? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Error message information leak] The error messages at lines 289-308 include the raw input strings - can this leak sensitive information or enable attackers to probe for valid address/key formats through error message differences? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Noise handshake validation] The network_address includes /handshake/0 suffix - is this handshake version properly validated elsewhere, or can nodes with different handshake versions be added as seeds, causing connection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [PeerRole hardcoding] The function hardcodes role as PeerRole::Upstream - can this create trust issues where seed peers are given excessive privileges, or should role be configurable per seed? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Keys set validation] The keys are stored in a hashset - if the hashset contains multiple keys, does the networking layer validate all keys or just the first one, potentially allowing key confusion attacks? (Medium)"
