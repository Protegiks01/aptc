  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Reentrancy] If the prover is invoked from a signal handler or atexit hook, can reentrant calls to main() or run() cause undefined behavior through non-reentrant functions in the call chain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Locale Issues] Does the program properly handle different system locales that might affect string comparison, file path handling, or error message formatting in Options::create_from_args or run_move_prover_v2? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Platform Differences] Are there platform-specific behaviors (Windows vs Linux vs macOS) in argument parsing at line 24 or TTY detection at lines 26-27 that could lead to security bypasses on certain validator node operating systems? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Return Value Validation] Does the program validate that run_move_prover_v2 returns an appropriate error when verification fails, or can the function return Ok(()) even when Move code has security violations, bypassing verification in automated deployment pipelines?
