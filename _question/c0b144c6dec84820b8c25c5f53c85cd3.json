  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [Function: load_json_file()] [String allocation attack] Can JSON data contain extremely long string values that cause unbounded memory allocation in serde_json, leading to OOM and denial of service during backup restoration? (High)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [Function: create_backup_with_random_suffix()] [Length validation] Does the try_into() conversion to ShellSafeName validate total length including the suffix, or can suffixes cause backup names to exceed the 127-character limit and cause validation failures?
