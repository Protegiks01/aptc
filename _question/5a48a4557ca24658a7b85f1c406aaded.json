  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause resource exhaustion by triggering expensive operations like Ledger communication or network requests in a loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: custom_network()] [Abort Error Handling] When `CliError::AbortedError` is returned, does the cleanup ensure no partial config is saved that could break the tool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Network Timeout] Do network operations (`client.get_account_balance()`, `fund_account()`, `lookup_address()`) have proper timeout handling to prevent indefinite hangs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async Runtime Safety] Does the async execution properly handle cancellation and cleanup if the user terminates the process mid-initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Option Unwrapping] The code frequently uses `.unwrap_or()` - are all cases covered where None values could cause unexpected behavior or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Public Key Validation] Is the public key from `private_key.clone().unwrap().public_key()` validated for correctness, or can corrupted private keys generate invalid public keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Key Encoding Vulnerability] Does `self.encoding_options.encoding` properly validate encoding types to prevent an attacker from specifying dangerous encodings that expose key material? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Key Material Zeroization] After private keys are used, are they properly zeroized from memory to prevent memory forensics or cold boot attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Ed25519 Implementation Safety] Does the Ed25519 implementation used have known vulnerabilities like small subgroup attacks or signature malleability issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Entropy Source Validation] Does `self.rng_args.key_generator()` validate that the entropy source is cryptographically secure and not predictable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Key Generation Seed] Can an attacker influence the seed used for key generation to produce predictable keys or reduce the keyspace? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Public Key Storage Security] Is storing the public key in `profile_config.public_key` safe, or can this leak information about the private key through mathematical relationships? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Clone Security] Does `private_key.clone()` create a deep copy that prevents the original from being accessed, or can multiple references to the same key material exist? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Prefix Stripping Security] Can `strip_private_key_prefix()` be exploited to accept malformed keys that bypass cryptographic validation but still get stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Default Profile Privilege Escalation] Can an attacker exploit the `DEFAULT_PROFILE` constant to gain elevated privileges or override system profiles? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Profile Name Validation] Does `profile_name()` validate profile names to prevent injection attacks through special characters or reserved names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Profile Removal Race] Can there be a race condition in `config.remove_profile(profile_name)` where multiple processes modify the same profile simultaneously? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [None Profile Handling] When `config.profiles.is_none()`, the code creates a new BTreeMap - can this be exploited to reset profiles or lose data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/init.rs] [Function: execute()] [Profile Overwrite Prompt Bypass] Can the `prompt_yes_with_override()` check be bypassed through signal handling or terminal manipulation? (Medium)",
