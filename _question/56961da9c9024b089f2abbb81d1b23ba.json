  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 1-115] [Missing Implementation] Does the slh_dsa_sha2_128s module actually exist in the codebase, or is this benchmark referencing non-existent code that would fail to compile, indicating incomplete post-quantum cryptography implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 7-11] [Dead Code] Are there any validators or nodes depending on SLH-DSA signatures while the implementation is missing, potentially causing consensus failures or signature verification bypasses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 1-115] [Incomplete Feature] Is SLH-DSA signature support advertised as available in Aptos documentation while the actual implementation is missing, creating a false security assumption for users relying on post-quantum security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Function: generate_random_message()] [Weak RNG] Does the benchmark use thread_rng() for message generation which may not be cryptographically secure in all contexts, potentially allowing predictable message patterns in production if this code is copied? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 47, 64, 79, 97] [RNG Reuse] Is the same CSPRNG instance reused across multiple benchmark iterations without proper reseeding, potentially creating correlations in generated keys or messages that could leak entropy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Function: generate_random_message()] [Entropy Exhaustion] Can an attacker exhaust the entropy pool by forcing excessive calls to thread_rng() during benchmarking, degrading randomness quality for subsequent cryptographic operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 26-30] [RNG State] Does fill_bytes() properly handle partial fills or RNG failures, or could incomplete message generation lead to signatures over predictable/zero-padded messages? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Function: sig_deserialize()] [Key Reuse] Is the same private key reused across benchmark iterations without proper isolation, potentially leaking key material through side-channel analysis of multiple signing operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 79-90] [Key Lifetime] Does the benchmark properly clear private key material from memory after use, or could sensitive keys remain in memory accessible to other processes or crash dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 97-98] [Key Derivation] Is the public key derived from the private key using a constant-time operation, or could timing differences reveal information about the private key structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 88] [Signature Generation] Does priv_key.sign() use deterministic or randomized signing, and could an attacker exploit non-determinism to collect multiple signatures on the same message and perform cryptanalysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 54-55, 106] [Error Handling] Are .unwrap() calls on sign() operations safe in production, or could signing failures in edge cases cause panics that halt validators and break consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Function: sign_32_bytes()] [Fixed Message Size] Does the signature scheme only support 32-byte messages as benchmarked, or could variable-length messages introduce vulnerabilities through improper padding or length extension attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 85-86] [Message Handling] Are messages properly hashed before signing in the actual implementation, or could direct signing of arbitrary data allow signature forgery through chosen-message attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 54-55] [Signature Malleability] Can an attacker create multiple valid signatures for the same message/key pair by manipulating the signature format, enabling replay attacks or signature stripping? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/slh_dsa_sha2_128s.rs] [Lines: 109] [Verification Bypass] Does the benchmark test verification of invalid signatures, or could the implementation have a bug that accepts all signatures regardless of validity? (Critical)",
