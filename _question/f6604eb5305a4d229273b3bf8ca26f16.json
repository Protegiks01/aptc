(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [State inconsistency] Does the early return on line 29 when element_2.is_zero() properly clean up borrowed references and context state, or can it leave dangling pointers in the AlgebraContext that could be exploited in subsequent operations to cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Gas manipulation] When division by zero occurs at line 28-29, gas is charged for equality check but not for division - can an attacker repeatedly call division with zero divisors to perform expensive equality checks while avoiding division gas costs, effectively getting undercharged and causing validator resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Return value manipulation] The false return at line 29 signals division-by-zero to Move code - can malicious contracts misinterpret this signal or fail to check it, leading to incorrect cryptographic operations that could enable signature forgery or invalid proof acceptance? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker pass u64::MAX as handle_1 or handle_2 at lines 23-24, causing overflow when cast to usize on 32-bit systems or when used as array indices, potentially accessing out-of-bounds memory and corrupting the AlgebraContext?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Gas metering bypass] The gas charging order at lines 27 and 31 charges equality check first, then division - can an attacker trigger early exit conditions after gas_eq but before gas_div to execute expensive operations while being undercharged, enabling DoS through gas exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Gas parameter manipulation] Are the gas parameters ALGEBRA_ARK_BLS12_381_FR_DIV (line 53) and similar constants properly calibrated to prevent attackers from performing divisions in expensive field extensions (Fq12) at the same cost as cheap fields (Fr), causing validator computation asymmetry? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/div.rs] [Function: ark_div_internal! macro] [Gas refund attack] If the division operation fails after gas is charged at line 31, is gas properly refunded, or can attackers repeatedly trigger failing divisions to drain gas without performing useful work, effectively stealing gas fees?
