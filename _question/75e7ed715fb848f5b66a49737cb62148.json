  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Version management] If max_network_channel_size needs to be changed network-wide, is there a versioning mechanism to ensure all validators upgrade simultaneously, or could mixed versions create channel size mismatches during protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Config migration] When upgrading from older Aptos versions that may not have JWKConsensusConfig, does the #[serde(default)] properly handle config files without this section, or could parsing errors cause validator startup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [OIDC provider manipulation] If a malicious OIDC provider frequently rotates keys (triggering JWK updates), could this generate message volumes that exceed max_network_channel_size causing legitimate providers' updates to be dropped? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Consensus fragmentation] Could Byzantine validators strategically send messages at rates that keep honest validators' channels at exactly max_network_channel_size capacity, preventing quorum formation for JWK updates? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Message replay amplification] If an attacker triggers re-sends of cached ObservationResponse messages, could this amplify message volume beyond max_network_channel_size causing channel overflow and JWK consensus failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [PartialEq implementation] Does the derived PartialEq correctly handle usize comparison across different architectures (32-bit vs 64-bit), or could config equality checks produce inconsistent results? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Debug trait leak] Does the derived Debug trait expose max_network_channel_size in logs/panics in a way that could leak information about validator channel capacity to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Serialize determinism] Is the Serialize implementation deterministic across Rust compiler versions and platforms, or could non-deterministic serialization cause config hash mismatches in consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Zero value] What happens if max_network_channel_size is explicitly set to 0 in the config - does channel creation fail gracefully with a clear error, or does it cause undefined behavior or panics? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Very small values] If max_network_channel_size is set to 1 or 2, could the channel deadlock because send operations block waiting for receive operations that can't proceed due to other blocked sends? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Mutation during runtime] If the config is reloaded at runtime (via SIGHUP or similar), could changing max_network_channel_size mid-operation cause existing channels to retain old size while new channels use new size, creating inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Node config] [On-chain config conflict] The node's max_network_channel_size is separate from OnChainJWKConsensusConfig - could Byzantine validators exploit mismatches between node-level channel size and on-chain JWK consensus settings to cause state divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Feature flag dependency] If JWK consensus is disabled via feature flags but max_network_channel_size is still configured, could this create zombie channels consuming resources unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Missing documentation] Are there no doc comments explaining the security implications of max_network_channel_size, safe value ranges, or guidance on sizing for different network scales, leading to operator misconfigurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Default implementation] [No rationale] Is the choice of 256 as default max_network_channel_size documented anywhere with performance analysis or security reasoning, or is it arbitrary leaving operators uncertain about changing it? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No property tests] Are there property-based tests verifying that all possible max_network_channel_size values (within reasonable ranges) maintain JWK consensus safety and liveness properties? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Load testing] Has the default value of 256 been validated under Byzantine attack scenarios where malicious validators attempt to saturate channels, or only under honest operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [No versioning] Is there a version field to support future additions to JWKConsensusConfig while maintaining backward compatibility, or will adding new fields break old configs? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: JWKConsensusConfig] [Limited extensibility] Does the minimal structure of JWKConsensusConfig make it difficult to add critical security parameters later (e.g., encryption settings, signature algorithms) without breaking changes? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Consensus config mismatch] Is there validation ensuring max_network_channel_size is compatible with ConsensusConfig's max_network_channel_size, or could conflicting values cause message routing issues between regular consensus and JWK consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Internal channel mismatch] The JWK consensus internally uses a 1024-sized self_sender channel and 100-sized jwk_rpc_msg_tx - are these values coordinated with max_network_channel_size or could size mismatches create bottlenecks? (Medium)"
