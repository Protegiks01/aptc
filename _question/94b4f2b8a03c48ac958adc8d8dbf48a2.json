  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVResponse] [None value poisoning] Can a Byzantine coordinator return RemoteKVResponse with None values for keys that actually exist in the state, causing transactions to incorrectly assume resources don't exist and violate Move resource safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVResponse] [Partial response] Can RemoteKVResponse return fewer state values than requested keys, causing executor shards to block indefinitely waiting for missing values and halting execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Function: RemoteKVResponse::new()] [Unbounded size] Does new() limit the size of the inner Vec to prevent memory exhaustion attacks where coordinator sends responses with billions of state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVResponse] [State value corruption] Can corrupted StateValue data in the response cause BCS deserialization failures during Move VM execution, leading to transaction failures and potential consensus disagreement on error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVResponse] [Duplicate keys in response] Can RemoteKVResponse contain duplicate (StateKey, Option<StateValue>) pairs that overwrite earlier values when cached, causing non-deterministic state view behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Serde derives] [BCS version mismatch] Do all structs using Serialize/Deserialize enforce BCS version compatibility, or can nodes running different BCS library versions produce incompatible serializations causing deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All structs] [Clone-based races] Since all structs derive Clone, can concurrent cloning and modification in multi-threaded contexts lead to race conditions where stale data is used for critical decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All structs] [Debug leak] Do the Debug trait implementations leak sensitive information (like transaction contents or state values) into logs that could be exploited by attackers monitoring validator logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Module structure] [Visibility abuse] Are the pub(crate) fields truly necessary, or do they expose internal implementation details that could be exploited by malicious code within the same crate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All network types] [Message size DoS] Are there size limits enforced during BCS serialization to prevent attackers from sending multi-gigabyte messages that exhaust network buffers and memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All network types] [Compression bypass] Can attackers send highly compressible but malicious payloads (e.g., zip bombs) that expand to enormous sizes during deserialization, causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionRequest/Result] [Type confusion in BCS] Can BCS deserialization be exploited to deserialize a RemoteExecutionRequest as a RemoteExecutionResult or vice versa, bypassing type safety and causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All structs] [Endianness attack] Does BCS handle endianness consistently across different architectures, or can validators running on different CPU architectures produce different serializations leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Output count mismatch] Can RemoteExecutionResult contain Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> with outer Vec length not matching the number of sub-blocks, causing index out of bounds when aggregating results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Gas manipulation] Can TransactionOutput values within RemoteExecutionResult have manipulated gas_used fields that don't match actual execution, allowing Byzantine shards to steal gas fees or bypass gas limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Write set forgery] Can the TransactionOutput write sets be forged by malicious executor shards to include unauthorized state changes that weren't produced by transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Event fabrication] Can TransactionOutput events be fabricated or omitted by Byzantine shards to hide malicious activity or create false audit trails in the blockchain history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Cross-shard dependencies] Can sub_blocks be crafted with transactions that have hidden cross-shard dependencies not captured in the AnalyzedTransaction analysis, causing execution to deadlock waiting for resources from other shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Unbalanced sharding] Can a malicious coordinator create extremely unbalanced sub_blocks where one shard has all transactions and others are empty, defeating parallel execution and causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Transaction reordering] Can the ordering of transactions within sub_blocks differ from the original block ordering in a way that violates transaction dependencies or replay protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Shard ID confusion] Can sub_blocks intended for ShardId N be accidentally or maliciously sent to ShardId M, causing both shards to execute the same transactions and produce duplicate state changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Zero concurrency] Can concurrency_level be set to 0, causing division by zero errors in thread pool allocation or execution parallelism calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Thread starvation] Can extremely low concurrency_level values (e.g., 1) on some shards while others use high values cause uneven execution times and timeout issues in cross-shard coordination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Concurrency override] If AptosVM has a global concurrency level set via set_concurrency_level_once, can per-command concurrency_level values conflict with this, causing race conditions in VM thread pool management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Feature flag abuse] Can onchain_config feature flags be manipulated to enable experimental or dangerous features on executor shards that differ from the main chain configuration? (Critical)"
