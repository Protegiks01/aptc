  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Configuration] [Expected pubkey initialization] If expected_pubkey at line 28 is initialized incorrectly at node startup, can this cause permanent key mismatch flags and connection failures without clear recovery path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Initialization] [Stream initialization order] If poll_next() is called before the first ReconfigNotification arrives, does it return Poll::Pending correctly, or can uninitialized state cause incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Logging] [Sensitive data exposure] The error log at lines 48-53 prints pubkeys with {:?} debug formatting - does this expose full cryptographic material that could aid in key extraction attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Logging] [Log injection] The peer_id logged at line 137 comes from untrusted on-chain data - can attackers inject newlines or control characters to forge log entries and bypass monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Observability] [Metric label cardinality] The metric labels at lines 61-65 include peer_id.short_str() - if attackers create many short-lived validators, can this cause unbounded metric cardinality and Prometheus memory exhaustion? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Validator manipulation] [Byzantine validator injection] Can a Byzantine validator controlling < 1/3 of stake craft a malicious ValidatorSet that includes non-existent validators, causing honest nodes to waste connection attempts and degrade performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Validator manipulation] [Address poisoning] Can an attacker submit a governance proposal that sets all validator addresses to localhost or 0.0.0.0, causing network partition when validators try to connect to invalid endpoints? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Validator manipulation] [Selective censorship] Can a validator who controls on-chain state omit specific validators from ValidatorSet updates, causing targeted nodes to disconnect and lose consensus participation? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Network partition] [Cross-network contamination] If extract_validator_set_updates() is called with wrong network_context (e.g., testnet context on mainnet), can this cause validators to discover testnet peers and partition the mainnet network?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Performance DoS] [Large ValidatorSet processing] If ValidatorSet grows to 10,000+ validators, can the iteration at lines 116-150 take so long that it delays consensus message processing and causes timeout failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/validator_set.rs] [Performance DoS] [Metric update overhead] Every reconfig event updates multiple metrics (lines 84-89, 60-66) - can high-frequency reconfigs cause metric lock contention and slow down all validator operations? (Medium)",
