  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_load_function_impl()] [Function name ignored] The function extracts (module_name, _) but ignores the function name - can this allow loading modules without validating that the specific function exists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_load_function_impl()] [Circular dependency] Can attackers create modules with circular dependencies that cause infinite loops in charge_gas_for_dependencies(), bypassing the gas limit? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_load_function_impl()] [Determinism guarantee] Are module loading and dependency traversal deterministic across all validators, or can network latency or cache states cause different gas charges leading to consensus divergence?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Registration order dependency] The natives array defines registration order - can this order affect resolution priority or allow later-registered functions to override earlier ones? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Integration: FunctionInfo struct compatibility] If the Move FunctionInfo struct definition changes field order or adds fields, can this break the hard-coded field indices (0, 1, 2) causing incorrect extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Integration: Gas schedule changes] If gas parameter constants (FUNCTION_INFO_*) are updated, can existing transactions with pre-calculated gas become invalid, or can old parameters allow exploitation? (High)",
