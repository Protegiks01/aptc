  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Bytecode Version Confusion] In compile_coverage() at line 182-185, can mismatched bytecode versions between the coverage map and compiled package cause the tool to interpret bytecode instructions incorrectly, leading to invalid coverage reports or crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Language Version Exploit] Can an attacker exploit differences between language versions (move_options.language_version) to cause the compiler to generate bytecode that has different behavior than the source code suggests, making coverage reports misleading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Extended Checks Bypass] At line 180, can skip_attribute_checks in move_options allow attackers to inject custom attributes that bypass Aptos extended checks, enabling dangerous compiler behaviors during coverage compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Full Model Generation Attack] When full_model_generation is true at line 176, can this trigger expensive model-building operations on maliciously complex Move code, causing resource exhaustion during coverage analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Dev Mode Exploitation] When dev_mode is enabled via move_options.dev at line 173, are there reduced security checks or additional debugging features that could be exploited during coverage compilation to bypass safety guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Stdout Hijacking] Since all three coverage commands write to std::io::stdout(), can an attacker redirect stdout to arbitrary files or devices through process manipulation, causing sensitive coverage data to be written to unintended locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Clone Security] Multiple locations use .clone() on modules and coverage data - can extremely large or maliciously structured data cause clone operations to trigger stack overflow, heap exhaustion, or other memory safety issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Error Propagation] Do all error paths properly clean up temporary files, locks, or other resources, or can forced errors leave the package directory in an inconsistent state that affects subsequent coverage runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Panic Safety] At lines 124 and 132, explicit panics are used - can an attacker trigger these panics in production tooling scenarios where unwinding could leave resources in corrupted states or leak sensitive data through panic messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Async Cancellation] If the async execute() methods are cancelled mid-execution (e.g., user presses Ctrl+C), are there proper cancellation-safe cleanup handlers to prevent file corruption or partial coverage data from being written? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Lifetime Issues] Are all reference lifetimes properly validated to prevent use-after-free when coverage data references source maps, compiled units, or file paths that might be deallocated during async operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Borrowed Data Safety] When iterating over package.root_modules() at lines 44-60, 126-134, can mutable access to the package during iteration cause iterator invalidation or memory safety violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [move_coverage Vulnerabilities] Does the move_coverage crate (imported at line 12-17) have any known vulnerabilities in CoverageMap deserialization, SourceCoverageBuilder, or output formatting that could be triggered through this file's usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [move_disassembler Exploits] Can the Disassembler::from_unit() and disassemble() calls at lines 162-164 trigger vulnerabilities in the move_disassembler crate, such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or unsafe pointer dereferences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [legacy_move_compiler Risks] The code uses legacy_move_compiler types (line 11) - does this expose the tool to deprecated, unmaintained compiler code that may have unpatched security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [move_package Compilation] Does the BuildConfig.compile_package() call at line 203-204 properly sandbox compilation to prevent malicious Move code from accessing file system, network, or executing arbitrary commands during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Framework Extended Checks] At line 180, extended_checks::get_all_attribute_names() loads Aptos framework validators - can malicious packages override or inject additional validators that weaken security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Coverage Map Format Version] Does from_binary_file() validate the coverage map format version, or can an attacker provide a coverage map from a future or past version that has incompatible data structures, causing type confusion or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Filter Unicode Bypass] Can Unicode normalization issues in the filter string comparison at line 49 cause certain module names to bypass filtering, exposing coverage for modules that should be hidden? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Module Name Collision] If multiple modules have similar names that match the filter, can this cause coverage data from one module to be incorrectly attributed to another, misleading developers about actual test coverage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Source Map Mismatch] If the source_map at line 123 doesn't correspond to the actual source file at source_path (due to stale compilation or tampering), can this cause incorrect coverage annotations that mark untested code as covered or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Bytecode Tampering Detection] Does the tool verify that the compiled bytecode matches the coverage map's expectations, or can an attacker modify bytecode after coverage collection to hide malicious code while showing legitimate coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Compiler Experiments Injection] Can malicious move_options.compute_experiments() at line 192 enable experimental compiler features that disable security checks, making dangerous Move code appear safe in coverage reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Print Errors Side Channel] With print_errors: true at line 193, can compilation errors leak sensitive information about package structure, dependencies, or internal implementation details that should not be exposed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Coverage-Guided Fuzzing Bypass] Can attackers analyze coverage reports to identify untested code paths, then craft specific attacks targeting those paths knowing they lack test coverage and may have undiscovered vulnerabilities?
