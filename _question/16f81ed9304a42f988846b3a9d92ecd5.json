  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BlockNotFound] [Information Leakage] Does the BlockNotFound error variant leak sensitive information about block execution state that could allow an attacker to fingerprint internal blockchain state or determine which blocks exist in speculative execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BlockNotFound] [Consensus Manipulation] Can a malicious validator trigger BlockNotFound errors for legitimate blocks by manipulating HashValue references, causing other validators to reject valid proposals and disrupting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BlockNotFound] [State Confusion] If BlockNotFound is returned for a block that was previously found, could this indicate a race condition in speculative execution that might lead to state inconsistencies across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BlockNotFound] [Hash Collision] Does the error handling properly distinguish between genuine missing blocks and potential hash collisions, or could an attacker craft transactions that produce HashValue collisions to cause execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BlockNotFound] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker flood the executor with requests for non-existent block IDs to trigger excessive BlockNotFound errors, consuming resources and degrading validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: DataNotFound] [Batch Processing Attack] Can a malicious actor manipulate batch IDs to trigger DataNotFound errors during parallel execution, causing legitimate transactions to fail and affecting system liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: DataNotFound] [State Synchronization] If DataNotFound occurs during state synchronization, could this indicate a vulnerability where validators might diverge in their view of available data, leading to network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: DataNotFound] [Resource Exhaustion] Does repeated DataNotFound error generation consume excessive memory or CPU through error string formatting and propagation, potentially causing validator slowdowns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: DataNotFound] [Information Disclosure] Does the batch ID exposure in DataNotFound errors reveal internal execution scheduling or batching strategies that could be exploited to predict transaction ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Integer Overflow] When calculating 'first_version + to_commit', could integer overflow occur if to_commit is excessively large, causing the comparison with target_version to pass incorrectly and commit wrong number of transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Version Manipulation] Can a malicious validator propose a block with manipulated version numbers (first_version, to_commit, target_version) that passes initial validation but triggers BadNumTxnsToCommit at commit time, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Underflow Attack] If first_version is greater than target_version, could this indicate an underflow in version arithmetic that might allow committing transactions in reverse order or skipping version numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Boundary Condition] When first_version + to_commit exactly equals target_version + 1, is this correctly rejected, or could off-by-one errors allow committing one extra transaction beyond the target? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Consensus Safety] If validators disagree on what constitutes 'bad' transaction counts due to race conditions, could this cause some validators to commit blocks while others reject them, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Wraparound Attack] For blockchains approaching maximum Version values (u64), could version number wraparound cause BadNumTxnsToCommit checks to fail incorrectly, allowing invalid commits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Zero Commit Attack] If to_commit is 0, does the error correctly prevent empty commits, or could this be exploited to advance version numbers without actually committing transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: BadNumTxnsToCommit] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly trigger BadNumTxnsToCommit errors to prevent the network from committing any transactions, causing total loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: InternalError] [Error Masking] Does the generic InternalError variant mask critical security-relevant errors from AptosDbError or StateViewError, preventing proper incident response and allowing attackers to exploit underlying vulnerabilities undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: InternalError] [String Formatting DoS] Can an attacker trigger errors with extremely long or recursive error messages that consume excessive memory during string formatting in InternalError, causing validator OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: InternalError] [Sensitive Data Leakage] Do InternalError messages potentially expose sensitive validator internals (file paths, memory addresses, cryptographic material) through the formatted error strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: InternalError] [Non-Determinism] If different validators encounter slightly different InternalError messages for the same underlying issue, could this lead to non-deterministic error handling and state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: InternalError] [Error Code Abuse] Can malicious code intentionally construct InternalError instances with misleading error messages to confuse monitoring systems or hide attack evidence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: SerializationError] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft malicious serialized data that triggers SerializationError after partial state modification, leaving the executor in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: SerializationError] [BCS Parsing Vulnerability] Does the conversion from bcs::Error properly validate all edge cases, or could specially crafted BCS payloads exploit parser vulnerabilities before SerializationError is raised? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: SerializationError] [Type Confusion] Can SerializationError be triggered by type confusion attacks where data is serialized as one type but deserialized as another, potentially bypassing Move type safety? (Critical)"
