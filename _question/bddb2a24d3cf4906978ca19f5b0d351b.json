  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: estimate_gas_price()] [Price Oracle Attack] Does estimate_gas_price() aggregate data from multiple sources, or can a single malicious node skew gas price estimates causing DoS or economic loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: set_failpoint()] [Injection Attack] Can an attacker inject malicious failpoint names or actions in set_failpoint() to cause unexpected system behavior or crashes in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: set_failpoint()] [Authorization Bypass] Does set_failpoint() require proper authorization, or can any client set failpoints causing denial of service or system instability? (High)",
