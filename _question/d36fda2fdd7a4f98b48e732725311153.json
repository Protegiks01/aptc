  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Configuration changes] If Configuration parameters like max_commited_epk_bytes change, could existing ZKP proofs fail verification unexpectedly, and is there migration logic to handle this? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Override aud validation] When override_aud_val is used in ZeroKnowledgeSig, does the ZKP proof properly validate both the override and original aud values, or could an attacker bypass aud checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Lifetime issues] While ZKP is Copy, could there be lifetime issues if it references borrowed data in future extensions, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Unsafe code] Although the ZKP enum itself contains no unsafe code, could unsafe code in the Groth16Proof validation logic introduce memory safety issues that propagate through the ZKP wrapper? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Integer overflow] Could operations involving ZKP serialization sizes or array indexing overflow, leading to buffer overruns or incorrect size calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [Implicit assumptions] Are there undocumented assumptions about ZKP usage (e.g., proofs must be verified before use) that if violated could lead to security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/zkp_sig.rs] [Enum: ZKP] [API misuse] Could developers accidentally use the From<ZKP> conversion without verifying the proof first, creating authentication bypass vulnerabilities in higher-level code? (High)"
