  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Load testing] Has the DKG protocol been load-tested under realistic traffic to validate that 256 is sufficient, or is this an arbitrary default? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Adversarial testing] Has the system been tested with intentionally undersized max_network_channel_size values to understand failure modes and ensure graceful degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Channel implementation dependency] The value is passed to aptos_channel::Config - are there assumptions in the channel implementation about reasonable buffer sizes that could be violated by extreme configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Network stack interaction] How does max_network_channel_size interact with lower-level network buffer sizes (TCP send/receive buffers, OS socket buffers), and could mismatches create bottlenecks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing documentation] The struct lacks documentation comments explaining security implications of max_network_channel_size - could operators misconfigure this without understanding the risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Tuning guidance] Is there guidance on how to tune max_network_channel_size based on network conditions and validator count, or are operators expected to use unsafe trial-and-error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Security warnings] Should the configuration system emit warnings when max_network_channel_size is set to dangerous values (too low or too high), or is silent acceptance the current behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Memory allocation] Does setting max_network_channel_size to a large value (e.g., 1 million) cause immediate memory allocation, or is memory allocated lazily as messages arrive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Memory exhaustion] On resource-constrained validator nodes, can a large max_network_channel_size combined with large DKG transcript messages cause OOM (out-of-memory) kills? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Memory leak potential] If DKG messages are not properly consumed from the channel due to bugs, could a full channel (at max_network_channel_size) represent a permanent memory leak? (Medium)"
