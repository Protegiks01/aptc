  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Request ID generation] How are RPC request IDs generated in OutboundRpcs, and can an attacker predict or manipulate them to cause response mismatching? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Timeout enforcement] inbound_rpc_timeout is set during initialization - but is this timeout properly enforced for ALL inbound RPCs, or can some requests bypass timeout? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Concurrent RPC tracking] Are concurrent RPC limits enforced atomically, or can race conditions allow exceeding max_concurrent limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Response without request] Can an attacker send RpcResponse messages without corresponding RpcRequest, causing outbound_rpcs to handle responses for non-existent requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Request timeout exploitation] Can an attacker send RPC requests designed to take exactly (timeout - epsilon) to process, keeping RPC slots occupied without triggering timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Response flooding] Can an attacker flood RpcResponses faster than outbound_rpcs can process them, causing memory buildup in the response queue? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [RPC security] [Bidirectional RPC] Can a peer be both sending an RPC request and receiving an RPC request with the same protocol_id simultaneously, causing confusion between inbound and outbound tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [Runtime safety] [Executor handle validity] The Handle passed in executor at line 115 - can this handle become invalid during peer lifetime, causing task spawn failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [Runtime safety] [Async task panics] If writer_task or multiplex_task panic, are these panics caught, or do they bring down the entire runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [Runtime safety] [Task cancellation] When do_shutdown is called, are spawned tasks properly cancelled or do they continue running as zombies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [Time manipulation] [TimeService trust] TimeService is passed as parameter - can a malicious TimeService return manipulated timestamps to bypass timeout enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/mod.rs] [Time manipulation] [Clock skew handling] Are clock differences between time_service and actual system time handled, or can they cause timeout miscalculations? (Medium)"
