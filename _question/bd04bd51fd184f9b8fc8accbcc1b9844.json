  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Struct Packing Safety] The Struct::pack() call with a single Value - can this fail or panic if the TypeName struct definition changes, causing validator crashes due to schema mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Type Argument Count] The debug_assert at line 89 checks ty_args.len() == 1 - in release builds, can passing 0 or >1 type arguments cause out-of-bounds access on ty_args[0], triggering memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Arguments Validation] The debug_assert at line 90 checks arguments.is_empty() - can non-empty arguments in release builds corrupt the function's execution or interfere with other native calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Canonical String Determinism] If to_canonical_string() is non-deterministic (e.g., due to platform differences in formatting), can validators produce different type_name outputs, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [UTF-8 Validation] Does to_canonical_string() always produce valid UTF-8, or can malformed types create invalid strings that violate Move's string invariants when converted to vector_u8? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [SmallVec Return Size] The function returns SmallVec<[Value; 1]> - can returning larger structures cause heap allocation inconsistencies between validators with different memory pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Gas Metering Bypass] Can the gas charging logic be bypassed by providing types that make to_canonical_string() return empty strings, resulting in zero gas cost for the operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Type Resolution Errors] Can unresolved or phantom type parameters cause type_to_type_tag() to fail or produce incorrect results, leading to wrong type names being returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_type_name()] [Recursive Type Handling] Can recursive or mutually recursive type definitions cause infinite loops in to_canonical_string(), hanging validator nodes and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_chain_id()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can the NativeTransactionContext be manipulated or injected with a fake chain_id value, allowing cross-chain replay attacks where transactions meant for one chain execute on another?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_chain_id()] [Gas Charging Timing] Gas is charged via TYPE_INFO_CHAIN_ID_BASE before accessing chain_id - but can the extensions().get() operation be expensive enough to cause DoS if performed before gas validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_chain_id()] [Chain ID Range] The function returns Value::u8(chain_id) - can chain_id values > 255 cause truncation or overflow, breaking the invariant that chain IDs fit in u8? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Function: native_chain_id()] [SmallVec Construction] The return value uses smallvec![Value::u8(chain_id)] - can this allocation fail or behave non-deterministically under memory pressure? (Low)",
