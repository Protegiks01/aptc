  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [Module Design] [Access Control] Does the public re-export of IpRangeManager and ListManager at lines 7-8 expose internal implementation details that could allow attackers to instantiate these managers with malicious configurations bypassing intended security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [Module Design] [Visibility Control] Can the public re-export of IpRangeManagerConfig and ListManagerConfig enable attackers to craft configuration files that bypass validation checks or inject malicious IP ranges/list items when the faucet loads these configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [Module Design] [Type Safety] Are there any unsafe type conversions or casting operations introduced by the module re-exports that could lead to memory safety issues when IpRangeManager or ListManager are used across module boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [Module Design] [API Surface] Does exposing both Config structs and Manager structs publicly create an unnecessarily large attack surface where configuration manipulation could compromise the security guarantees of IP blocking and list management? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [File Injection] Can an attacker who gains control over the file path in IpRangeManagerConfig::file exploit the file loading in IpRangeManager::new() to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive validator keys or configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Path Traversal] Does the IpRangeManagerConfig accept file paths with '..' or symbolic links that could allow attackers to load IP range files from unintended directories, bypassing security boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a malicious IP range file with millions of overlapping CIDR ranges causing IpRangeManager::new() to consume excessive memory and CPU during parsing, leading to faucet service denial-of-service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [IP Spoofing] Does the IpRangeManager::contains_ip() method properly handle edge cases like IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (::ffff:192.0.2.1) that could allow attackers to bypass IP blocklists by using different IP address representations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Parsing Vulnerabilities] Can malformed IP range strings in the configuration file (e.g., '999.999.999.999/999') cause panic or undefined behavior in the line.parse::<Ipv4Net>() and line.parse::<Ipv6Net>() calls, crashing the faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Comment Bypass] Does the comment parsing logic (lines 32-34 checking for '#', '//', empty lines) have any edge cases where specially crafted input like '#malicious-ip\\r\\n1.2.3.4/32' could bypass comment filtering and inject malicious IP ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Race Condition] If IpRangeManager is re-initialized at runtime (e.g., config reload), can race conditions between IpRangeManager::new() and IpRangeManager::contains_ip() cause inconsistent IP blocking where some requests bypass the blocklist during the reload window? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where the IP range file is validated during IpRangeManager::new() but modified before IpRangeManager::contains_ip() is called, allowing attackers to inject malicious IP ranges after validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [IPv6 Edge Cases] Does the dual-list structure (separate ipv4_list and ipv6_list) properly handle all IPv6 special cases like link-local addresses (fe80::), multicast (ff00::), and loopback (::1) to prevent attackers from exploiting these to bypass IP-based rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [CIDR Overlap] Can an attacker exploit overlapping CIDR ranges (e.g., '10.0.0.0/8' and '10.1.0.0/16') to create ambiguity in IP matching that allows bypass of blocklists or unexpected allowlist behavior leading to unauthorized faucet access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [IpRangeManager Re-export] [Error Handling] Does the bail!() error on line 44 for unparseable IP ranges properly clean up partial state, or can it leave the IpRangeManager in an inconsistent state with only partially loaded IP ranges, weakening security controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [File Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the ListManagerConfig::file path to read sensitive files (like private keys, database credentials) through ListManager::new(), exploiting the file reading capability for information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Path Traversal] Does ListManagerConfig accept relative paths with directory traversal sequences ('../../../etc/passwd') allowing attackers to load arbitrary files into the allowlist/blocklist HashSet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a list file with millions of entries causing ListManager::new() to exhaust memory when building the HashSet, leading to faucet service crash or system-wide memory pressure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Hash Collision DoS] Can an attacker craft list entries that deliberately collide in the HashSet hash function, degrading ListManager::contains() performance from O(1) to O(n) and causing denial-of-service when checking list membership? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Unicode Normalization] Does ListManager::contains() handle Unicode normalization properly, or can attackers bypass string-based blocklists by using different Unicode representations (e.g., 'user@example.com' vs 'user＠example.com') of the same logical string? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Case Sensitivity] Is ListManager::contains() case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass email or domain blocklists by varying capitalization (e.g., 'BLOCKED@DOMAIN.COM' vs 'blocked@domain.com')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Whitespace Handling] Can trailing/leading whitespace in list entries or query strings cause ListManager::contains() to incorrectly match or miss entries, allowing blocklist bypass via padded inputs like ' blocked-user '? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Empty String] Does ListManager properly handle empty strings in the list or as query parameters, or can an empty string in the blocklist cause all ListManager::contains() checks to return true, blocking all faucet requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Comment Injection] Similar to IpRangeManager, can specially crafted comment lines (lines 27-29) with embedded newlines or special characters bypass comment filtering and inject malicious entries into the HashSet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/mod.rs] [ListManager Re-export] [Race Condition] If ListManager is rebuilt at runtime during config reload, can concurrent access to ListManager::contains() during ListManager::new() cause race conditions where some requests see stale data or partial list updates?
