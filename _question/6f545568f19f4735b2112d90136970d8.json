  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Code quality] [Magic constant LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION] The constant is imported from gas_schedule module - if it's not updated when new versions ship, can this cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Code quality] [DummyConfigStorage used in production] Are there safeguards preventing DummyConfigStorage from being used outside test/latest() contexts, or can it accidentally leak into production builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Code quality] [Public struct fields] Making io_pricing, space_pricing, and change_set_configs public allows external mutation - should these be private with getter methods to enforce immutability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [IoPricingV1 exploit] [legacy_write_data_per_new_item vulnerability] IoPricingV1 charges per_new_item only on Creation - can attackers create many tiny items to avoid per_new_item charges on modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [IoPricingV1 exploit] [load_data_failure abuse] V1 charges load_data_failure for non-existent reads - can attackers intentionally read missing keys because failure gas is less than success gas plus I/O costs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [IoPricingV2 exploit] [Free quota stacking] With free_write_bytes_quota in V2, can attackers structure transactions to get quota applied to every write operation, multiplying the effective free bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [IoPricingV3 exploit] [Gas expression manipulation] V3 returns GasExpression instead of concrete InternalGas - can the deferred evaluation be exploited to bypass gas limits or cause non-deterministic gas calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [IoPricingV4 exploit] [Page rounding waste] V4 rounds reads to 4KB pages - can attackers exploit this by reading 1 byte from many pages, paying for full pages but only accessing minimal data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [Large StateKey allocation] Can attackers cause memory exhaustion by creating StateKeys with extremely large encoded representations before gas limits are checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [ConfigStorage lifetime] Does ConfigStorage borrow checking ensure the storage remains valid for the entire lifetime of StorageGasParameters, or can use-after-free occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [Clone performance] Cloning StorageGasParameters clones IoPricing enums which may be large (V2 has many fields) - can excessive cloning cause memory pressure or DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Transaction flow] [Prologue bypass] If StorageGasParameters is constructed in transaction prologue, can attackers craft transactions that skip prologue and use uninitialized/default parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Transaction flow] [Epilogue tampering] If gas calculations in epilogue use different StorageGasParameters than execution, can this cause incorrect refunds or charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Transaction flow] [Gas depletion edge case] If a transaction runs out of gas during StorageGasParameters construction, does error handling properly abort or can partial initialization cause corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Cryptographic] [StateKey hash collision] If StateKey::size() or StateKey::encoded() can be manipulated via hash collisions, can attackers create distinct keys that report identical sizes for gas calculation bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Cryptographic] [Merkle tree interaction] Do gas calculations account for Merkle tree update costs, or can attackers create state changes that require expensive tree operations while paying only for raw data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Feature flags] [is_refundable_bytes_enabled() timing attack] Can attackers monitor for the exact block where is_refundable_bytes_enabled() flips and submit transactions that exploit the transition state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Feature flags] [Feature combination exploits] Can specific combinations of enabled/disabled features create pricing edge cases that weren't tested, enabling gas bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Feature flags] [Default feature assumptions] Features::default() may have unexpected feature states - can this cause silent failures when code assumes certain features are enabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Advanced gas attack] [Write operation batching] Can attackers batch many small write operations in a single transaction to amortize per-transaction gas across many operations, achieving lower per-operation costs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Advanced gas attack] [Resource group exploitation] Do gas calculations properly account for resource group overhead, or can attackers manipulate group size to pay less gas than actual storage costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Advanced gas attack] [Table item gas bypass] Are table items charged the same as regular resources, or can attackers use table items to store large data at lower gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/storage/mod.rs] [Governance] [Gas parameter governance attack] Can malicious validators propose governance changes that set exploitable gas parameters (e.g., zero costs or u64::MAX limits), then exploit them before honest validators can react? (Critical)",
