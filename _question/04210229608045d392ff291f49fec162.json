  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: TransactionFiltersConfig] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious configuration file with conflicting filter rules across api_filter, consensus_filter, execution_filter, mempool_filter, and quorum_store_filter that cause different nodes to accept/reject different transactions, leading to state divergence and consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: TransactionFiltersConfig] [Configuration Injection] Does the serde deny_unknown_fields attribute properly prevent attackers from injecting additional fields during deserialization that could bypass filter checks or introduce backdoors in the filtering logic? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: TransactionFiltersConfig] [Default Behavior Exploit] Can an attacker exploit the Default implementation which sets all filters to disabled by default, allowing malicious transactions to bypass all filtering if a node operator forgets to explicitly enable filters during configuration? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 13-17] [Filter Consistency] Are there any invariants enforced to ensure consistency between api_filter, consensus_filter, execution_filter, mempool_filter, and quorum_store_filter, or can inconsistent filter configurations cause transactions accepted by mempool to be rejected by consensus, leading to wasted resources and potential DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: TransactionFiltersConfig] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone implementation for TransactionFiltersConfig create deep copies of all filter rules, or could shared references allow one component to mutate filters affecting other components, causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: TransactionFilterConfig::new()] [Unchecked Input] Does the new() constructor validate that the transaction_filter is non-empty when filter_enabled is true, or can attackers create enabled but empty filters that accept all transactions by default, bypassing security policies? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: TransactionFilterConfig::is_enabled()] [Logic Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the dual condition in is_enabled() (filter_enabled && !is_empty()) by setting filter_enabled=true with an empty filter to bypass checks that only verify filter_enabled without calling is_enabled()? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: TransactionFilterConfig::transaction_filter()] [Immutable Reference] Does returning an immutable reference prevent runtime modification, or can unsafe code or interior mutability patterns allow attackers to modify filter rules during transaction processing, causing TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 46-52] [Default Disabled State] Can the default disabled state for TransactionFilterConfig create a security-by-obscurity scenario where critical filters remain disabled in production if not explicitly configured, allowing malicious transactions through? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: TransactionFilterConfig] [Serialization] Does the Serialize implementation prevent leaking sensitive filter criteria (like specific blocked addresses or public keys) when configurations are logged or transmitted, potentially revealing security policies to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BatchTransactionFilterConfig::new()] [Batch Validation] Does the constructor validate batch_transaction_filter integrity, or can attackers create filters with malformed batch matchers (BatchId, BatchAuthor, BatchDigest) that cause panic or unexpected behavior during quorum store filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BatchTransactionFilterConfig::is_enabled()] [Quorum Store Bypass] In the quorum store context, can validators with disabled batch filters accept malicious batch proposals that other validators with enabled filters reject, causing batch availability inconsistencies and consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BatchTransactionFilterConfig::batch_transaction_filter()] [Reference Safety] Can concurrent access to the BatchTransactionFilter reference during batch voting lead to data races if the underlying filter is modified through unsafe operations elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 81-87] [Default Empty Filter] Does the default empty BatchTransactionFilter allow all batch transactions through by default, and can this be exploited by attackers who compromise validator configurations to accept malicious batches without filtering? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: BatchTransactionFilterConfig] [Batch Digest Matching] When matching against BatchDigest in filters, are hash collisions properly handled, or could an attacker create batches with colliding digests to bypass filter rules targeting specific malicious batches? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BlockTransactionFilterConfig::new()] [Block Context] Does the constructor ensure block_transaction_filter is compatible with consensus requirements, or can filters be created that reject all transactions from certain block authors, enabling censorship attacks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BlockTransactionFilterConfig::is_enabled()] [Consensus Impact] If consensus_filter.is_enabled() returns false during critical voting periods, can malicious validators propose blocks containing filtered transactions that would normally be rejected, breaking safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Function: BlockTransactionFilterConfig::block_transaction_filter()] [Execution Filter] For execution_filter, can discrepancies between filter application during proposal generation vs. block execution cause validators to execute different transaction sets, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 116-122] [Default Block Filter] Does the default empty BlockTransactionFilter configuration leave new validators vulnerable to accepting malicious blocks until proper filters are configured, creating a window of vulnerability during validator onboarding? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Struct: BlockTransactionFilterConfig] [Epoch Boundaries] When BlockEpochGreaterThan and BlockEpochLessThan matchers are used, are epoch transitions handled atomically to prevent transactions from bypassing filters during epoch changes? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 13] [API Filter Bypass] Can an attacker submit transactions through the API that pass api_filter but are later rejected by mempool_filter, causing resource exhaustion from repeated failed submissions and API service degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 14] [Consensus Filter Manipulation] If consensus_filter is configured differently across validators, can Byzantine validators propose blocks that pass their lenient filters but fail strict filters on honest validators, causing voting failures and liveness issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 15] [Execution Filter Race] Can race conditions between reading execution_filter configuration and applying it during parallel block execution cause some transactions to bypass filtering, leading to execution of malicious transactions? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 16] [Mempool Filter Inconsistency] If mempool_filter accepts transactions that execution_filter later rejects, can attackers flood the mempool with invalid transactions that consume resources during proposal generation but fail during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 17] [Quorum Store Filter] Can validators with disabled quorum_store_filter accept and vote on batches containing transactions that other validators reject, causing batch certificate generation to fail and quorum store to stall? (High)"
