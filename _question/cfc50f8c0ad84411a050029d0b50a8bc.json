  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Weak Algorithms] Can an attacker inject JWKs with weak cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RS256 with 512-bit keys, HS256 with short secrets) that get accepted and weaken authentication security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Key Type Confusion] Can an attacker provide JWKs with mismatched key types (e.g., claiming RSA but providing EC parameters) that cause validation errors or incorrect signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Duplicate Key IDs] What happens if multiple JWKs in the response have the same 'kid' (key ID) - does the system use the first, last, or fail, and can this enable key substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Missing Key Fields] Can an attacker provide JWKs missing critical fields like 'n' and 'e' for RSA keys, causing signature verification to fail or use default/zero values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Key Size Limits] Are there limits on JWK key sizes, or can an attacker provide extremely large RSA moduli (e.g., 16384-bit) that cause CPU exhaustion during signature verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Content-Type Validation] Does the function validate that the response Content-Type is application/json, or will it attempt to parse HTML/XML responses as JSON leading to parsing errors or vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Content-Type Check] Can an attacker return non-JSON content types (text/html, application/xml) for the OpenID configuration that gets incorrectly parsed causing security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [HTTP Status Codes] Are non-200 HTTP status codes properly handled, or can an attacker use 3xx redirects, 4xx errors, or 5xx errors with response bodies that get parsed as valid JWKs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Character Encoding] Does the JSON parser handle different character encodings (UTF-16, UTF-32) correctly, or can encoding attacks bypass validation or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Concurrent Fetches] If multiple validators or threads call fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri simultaneously for the same URL, can race conditions cause inconsistent JWK sets to be cached or used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Async Cancellation] If the async fetch operation is cancelled mid-flight (e.g., validator shutdown), can partial or corrupted JWK data be persisted causing authentication failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Sequential Calls] When fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config is called before fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri, can time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities allow jwks_uri to be changed between calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Client Reuse] Does creating a new reqwest::Client for each request prevent connection pooling and cause resource exhaustion under high load during JWK rotation events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Error Propagation] When request_builder.send().await? fails, does the error message leak sensitive information like internal URLs, API keys, or network topology to logs or callers? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Partial Failures] If the OpenID config fetch succeeds but returns malformed data, does error handling distinguish between network errors and data errors to prevent incorrect retry logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Panic on Invalid JWK] Does JWK::from() panic on invalid input rather than returning an error, potentially crashing the validator node and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Consensus Divergence] Can different validators fetch JWKs at different times during key rotation, causing them to accept/reject different keyless account transactions and creating consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Determinism] Since JWK fetching is non-deterministic (network timing, DNS resolution), can this cause validators to have different JWK sets leading to transaction execution divergence? (Critical)",
