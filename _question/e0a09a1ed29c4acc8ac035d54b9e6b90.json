  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Enum: CommitMessage] [Nack injection] Can attacker inject Nack into reliable broadcast protocol at unexpected points (not as RPC response) causing protocol confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Validator set staleness] If ValidatorVerifier has stale validator set during epoch transition, can it verify signatures from removed validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Verifier bypass] Can attacker provide malicious ValidatorVerifier implementation that always returns Ok, bypassing all signature checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Threshold manipulation] Does ValidatorVerifier.verify_signatures() correctly enforce 2f+1 threshold, or can attacker manipulate voting power to lower threshold? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serde exploit] Can specially crafted CommitMessage exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in Serde causing RCE on receiving validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Bytes manipulation] Can attacker manipulate raw Bytes in-transit to change message type from Vote to Decision without detection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Enum: CommitMessage] [Size limit] Is there a maximum size limit on CommitMessage preventing attacker from sending multi-GB messages causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Retry amplification] If all validators retry failed broadcasts simultaneously, can this create thundering herd causing network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Timeout precision] Are timeout durations validated to be reasonable (not 0 or MAX), or can extreme timeouts cause resource holding attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Exponential backoff] Does retry logic use exponential backoff, or can constant retries against Byzantine validators waste resources? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: safety guarantee] [Byzantine threshold] With f Byzantine validators, can they collude to create valid CommitDecision with 2f+1 signatures where f signatures are from Byzantine validators + f from honest validators, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: liveness guarantee] [Minority attack] Can f Byzantine validators refusing to send Ack responses permanently halt consensus by preventing reliable broadcast from completing? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: atomicity] [Partial commit] Can some validators commit a block based on CommitDecision while others don't, creating state divergence? (Critical)"
