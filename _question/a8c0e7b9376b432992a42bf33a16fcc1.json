  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Struct: UserTransactionPayloadFilter] [Single field limitation] Does UserTransactionPayloadFilter only support filtering by entry function, ignoring other payload types like Script or Multisig, potentially allowing non-entry-function payloads to bypass filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Struct: UserTransactionPayloadFilter] [Null function filter] Can a UserTransactionPayloadFilter be created with function set to None, passing validation if created without the builder, and then matching all payloads indiscriminately?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Function: From<protobuf> for UserTransactionPayloadFilter] [Optional handling] Does the map(|f| f.into()) operation properly handle None values in proto_filter.entry_function_filter, or could Some(null) cause panics?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Function: validate_state() for UserTransactionPayloadFilter] [Recursive validation] Does calling self.function.is_valid() properly validate the nested EntryFunctionFilter, or should it call validate_state() to avoid double error annotation?
