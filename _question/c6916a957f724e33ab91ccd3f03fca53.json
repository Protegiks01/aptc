  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Constant: CACHE_SIZE_ESTIMATION] [Misconfiguration] Is CACHE_SIZE_ESTIMATION (250,000 transactions) appropriate for Aptos's transaction throughput, or could high-load scenarios exceed this causing excessive cache misses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Constant: MAX_CACHE_FETCH_SIZE] [Unused Constant] Line 16 defines MAX_CACHE_FETCH_SIZE but it's never used in the code - is this a security control that should be enforced but isn't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Constant: CACHE_SIZE_EVICTION_LOWER_BOUND] [Buffer Gap] The 50,000 transaction gap between CACHE_SIZE_ESTIMATION and CACHE_SIZE_EVICTION_LOWER_BOUND is mentioned as a buffer, but is this sufficient for high concurrency scenarios? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Enum: CacheBatchGetStatus] [State Handling] Do callers properly handle all three enum variants (Ok, EvictedFromCache, NotReady), or could unhandled cases cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Enum: CacheUpdateStatus] [Unused Enum] CacheUpdateStatus is defined but never returned by any function - is this dead code or a missing feature? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Struct: CacheOperator] [Clone Safety] The Clone trait is implemented for CacheOperator - does cloning create independent Redis connections, or do clones share connections causing concurrency issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Async Safety] Are the async functions truly safe for concurrent execution, or can interleaved operations on the same CacheOperator instance cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Lines: 106-112] [Mutable Reference] Many functions take &mut self - does this prevent concurrent reads, or is the mutex-like behavior at the Redis level sufficient for safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/cache_operator.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Non-Atomic Operations] Functions like check_cache_coverage_status() followed by batch_get_encoded_proto_data() create a time-of-check-time-of-use gap - can this cause races? (High)",
