  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Namespace injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious key name containing the NAMESPACE_SEPARATOR ('/') character to escape namespace isolation and access cryptographic keys from other validators' namespaces, potentially stealing consensus signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Key collision] If namespace is 'validator' and key is '/consensus_key', does the resulting path 'validator//consensus_key' collide with a different namespace 'validator/' and key 'consensus_key', allowing cross-namespace key access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty namespace bypass] Can an attacker create a Namespaced instance with an empty string namespace, causing all namespaced keys to become '/keyname', potentially colliding with keys from a namespace named empty string or bypassing isolation entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Unicode normalization attack] Can an attacker use Unicode characters with different normalization forms (NFC vs NFD) in namespace or key names to create collisions, accessing keys from what appears to be a different namespace? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker use '../' or './' sequences in the key name to traverse directories in OnDiskStorage implementations, accessing keys outside their namespace or even system files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Null byte injection] Can an attacker inject null bytes ('\\0') in namespace or key names to truncate the path in C-based storage backends, bypassing namespace isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: new()] [Namespace impersonation] Can a malicious process create a namespace identical to a validator's namespace (e.g., by reading the namespace value through memory inspection), then use that to access or modify the validator's consensus keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Multiple separator injection] Can an attacker craft a key containing multiple '/' separators like 'key1/../../namespace2/key2' to perform path traversal and access keys in arbitrary namespaces? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Homoglyph attack] Can an attacker use visually similar Unicode characters (homoglyphs) to create a namespace that appears identical to a legitimate validator namespace but actually points to a different storage location? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Case sensitivity bypass] If the underlying storage is case-insensitive (Windows filesystem), can an attacker use different case combinations ('Validator' vs 'validator') to bypass namespace isolation and access other validators' keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Whitespace manipulation] Can an attacker use leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, or other whitespace characters in namespace or key names to create collisions or bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Absolute path injection] Can an attacker provide an absolute path as the key name (e.g., '/etc/passwd' or 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32') to bypass namespace prefixing entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: new()] [Namespace length overflow] Can an attacker create an extremely long namespace string that causes buffer overflow or integer overflow when concatenated with key names in the namespaced() function? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Control character injection] Can an attacker inject control characters (newlines, carriage returns, bell characters) in namespace or key names to manipulate storage backend behavior or logging systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Symlink exploitation] In OnDiskStorage, can an attacker create symbolic links within their namespace directory that point to keys in other namespaces, then access those keys through the symlink? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Reserved name collision] Can an attacker use reserved filesystem names (like 'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX' on Windows, or '.' and '..' on Unix) to cause unexpected behavior or access parent directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Encoding bypass] Can an attacker use percent-encoding, URL encoding, or other encoding schemes in key names that get decoded by the storage backend, bypassing namespace isolation after decoding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Separator prefix attack] Can an attacker create a namespace like 'validator/' (with trailing separator) that when combined with key 'consensus' creates 'validator//consensus', potentially colliding with namespace 'validator' and key '/consensus'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: new()] [Dynamic namespace modification] After creating a Namespaced instance, can an attacker modify the namespace field through unsafe code or memory corruption, redirecting all subsequent operations to a different namespace?

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Format string injection] Can an attacker inject format string specifiers (like '%s', '%x') in namespace or key names that get interpreted by logging or storage systems, leaking sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Double encoding bypass] Can an attacker double-encode special characters (encoding '/' as '%2F' then encoding again) that get decoded twice by storage backends, ultimately bypassing namespace isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: namespaced()] [Zero-width character injection] Can an attacker inject zero-width Unicode characters between namespace and key to create visually identical but different paths that bypass collision detection? (Medium)",
