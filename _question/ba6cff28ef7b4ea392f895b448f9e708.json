  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Transaction Flow: All Paths] [Atomic state transition violation] Can any transaction flow path (validation error, verification error, execution failure) leave the state in a partially modified inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor] [Panic propagation] If a panic occurs during execute_block(), can it propagate to the consensus layer causing validator crashes and liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Transaction Flow: Prologue/Epilogue] [Prologue-Epilogue mismatch] Can discrepancies between prologue validation logic and epilogue finalization logic cause transactions to pass validation but fail finalization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Directive: forbid(unsafe_code)] [Unsafe code in dependencies] While lib.rs forbids unsafe code, can dependencies or submodules use unsafe code blocks that introduce memory safety vulnerabilities? (High)",
