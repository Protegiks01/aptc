  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/proptest_types.rs] [Function: SignatureCheckedTransaction::arbitrary_with()] [Invalid signatures] The comment at line 501 notes only valid signed transactions are generated - does this mean tests never cover invalid signature scenarios, potentially missing signature verification bypass bugs in production?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/proptest_types.rs] [Function: Script::arbitrary_with()] [Invalid bytecode] The comment at line 583 acknowledges scripts aren't actually valid programs - can invalid bytecode in test generation miss Move VM vulnerabilities that only trigger on specific malformed bytecode patterns?
