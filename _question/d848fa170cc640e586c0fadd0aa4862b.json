  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Signature Malleability] Can an attacker exploit signature malleability in Ed25519 by providing a valid signature (r,s) and its malleable variant (r, -s mod l) to bypass replay protection or double-spend funds, since the function only checks verify_arbitrary_msg() without enforcing canonical s values? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Weak Subgroup Attack] Does the Ed25519PublicKey::try_from() deserialization at line 51-55 properly validate that the public key point is not in a small-order subgroup, or can an attacker provide a low-order point to create universal forgery signatures that verify for any message? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Point Validation Bypass] The comment at line 26 claims 'point-on-curve and small subgroup checks' occur during deserialization, but can an attacker craft malformed public key bytes that pass try_from() but represent invalid curve points, allowing unauthorized transaction signing? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Signature Forgery] Can an attacker exploit weaknesses in the verify_arbitrary_msg() implementation at line 58 by crafting signatures with specific r,s values that satisfy the verification equation for arbitrary messages without knowing the private key? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Identity Point Attack] If an attacker provides the Ed25519 identity point (point at infinity) as the public key, does the verification at lines 51-55 properly reject it, or can this lead to signature verification always succeeding/failing regardless of the signature? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Batch Verification Bypass] If this function is called multiple times in a single transaction for batch signature verification, can an attacker exploit timing differences or state inconsistencies to cause some signatures to be verified incorrectly, leading to unauthorized fund transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Key Length Validation] Does the function properly validate that key_bytes at line 22 is exactly 32 bytes for Ed25519, or can an attacker provide shorter/longer byte arrays that pass validation but cause undefined behavior in downstream cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Signature Length Validation] Does try_from() at lines 45-49 enforce that the signature is exactly 64 bytes, or can an attacker provide truncated/extended signatures that are incorrectly accepted or cause parsing errors leading to incorrect verification results? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Cross-Scheme Attack] Can an attacker take a valid signature from a different signature scheme (e.g., ECDSA, BLS) and attempt to verify it as Ed25519 at line 58, potentially causing verification to succeed due to mathematical coincidences or implementation bugs? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Cofactor Verification] Does the verify_arbitrary_msg() call at line 58 perform cofactorless verification (checking 8*s*B = 8*R + 8*H(R,A,M)*A), or can an attacker exploit missing cofactor multiplication to forge signatures using points with order dividing 8? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Gas Calculation Overflow] At line 24, the gas cost calculation '26 * usize::max(key_bytes.len(), 1) as u64' can overflow if key_bytes.len() is near usize::MAX on 32-bit systems, resulting in undercharged gas that allows DoS attacks through repeated cheap calls? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Gas Calculation Overflow] At line 43, the gas cost '62 * usize::max(msg.len(), 1) as u64' can overflow for extremely large messages on 32-bit platforms, enabling attackers to consume excessive compute resources while paying minimal gas? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Gas Underpricing] The fixed gas coefficient of 62 at line 43 may not accurately reflect the actual computational cost of Ed25519 signature verification for very small or very large messages, allowing attackers to DoS validators by submitting adversarially crafted transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Gas Underpricing] The fixed gas coefficient of 26 at line 24 for public key validation may be too low compared to the actual cryptographic operations (point decompression, curve equation check, subgroup check), enabling gas-exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Gas Front-Running] Since gas is charged at line 43 before signature verification completes at line 58, can an attacker exploit this by submitting invalid signatures that consume gas but fail verification, griefing other users by filling blocks with invalid transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Unbounded Input DoS] Can an attacker pass extremely large key_bytes vectors (e.g., several MB) at line 22, causing excessive memory allocation and computation in try_from() at line 27 before gas is deducted, potentially crashing validator nodes?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Gas Refund Exploit] If signature verification fails at lines 47-49 or 53-55, the function returns the same cost value - can an attacker exploit early-exit paths to receive gas refunds while still consuming validator resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Silent Failure Exploit] When Ed25519Signature::try_from() fails at lines 45-49, the function silently returns 'false' instead of propagating an error - can this lead to transactions being incorrectly accepted by calling code that doesn't check the return value properly? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Silent Failure Exploit] When Ed25519PublicKey::try_from() fails at lines 51-55, returning 'false' instead of an error, can this cause authorization bypasses if Move code incorrectly interprets 'false' as a temporary failure rather than a permanent rejection? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Error Swallowing] At line 27, is_ok() swallows the specific error from try_from() - can attackers exploit this by not knowing whether their malformed keys failed due to invalid length, invalid encoding, or failed curve checks, allowing repeated blind attacks? (Low)",

(High)",
