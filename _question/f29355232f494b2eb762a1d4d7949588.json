  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Transaction inclusion] Is CompilationMetadata included in transaction payloads? Could transaction size limits prevent inclusion of necessary version metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Version negotiation] How do validators with different supported versions negotiate which version to use for new bytecode? Could this negotiation be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Backward compatibility] When loading old bytecode without CompilationMetadata, what defaults are assumed? Could this cause security issues with historical transactions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: LanguageVersion::language_version_for_public_struct()] [Boolean return] Does returning a boolean for feature checks allow for proper error handling, or could callers ignore the check? Should this return Result instead? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Compiler optimizations] Could aggressive compiler optimizations reorder version checks or eliminate them entirely, bypassing stability validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Module visibility] Are CompilerVersion and LanguageVersion properly encapsulated? Could external code construct invalid version combinations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Serde attributes] Are there any serde attributes (like #[serde(skip)], #[serde(default)]) that could cause fields to be omitted or defaulted during serialization, bypassing security checks? (Medium)"
