  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: TransactionRestoreController::run()] [Replay attack] Can old transactions be restored and replayed to reverse finalized transactions, enabling double-spending or theft of funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Resource exhaustion] Can restore operations be exploited to consume excessive disk space, memory, or CPU, causing validator nodes to crash or miss consensus deadlines? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Struct: BootstrapDB] [DB directory permissions] Does the restore process properly validate db_dir permissions, or can it restore to directories where other processes have write access, enabling database tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Concurrent restores] Can multiple restore operations run simultaneously on the same database, causing race conditions and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/restore.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Partial restore exploitation] Can an attacker restore only part of the backup (e.g., transactions without corresponding state) to create an inconsistent database state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Determinism failure] If replayed transactions produce different outputs than the original execution, can this indicate a non-deterministic bug in the Move VM that could cause validator disagreement and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Version range manipulation] Can manipulated start_version or end_version values cause the replay to skip verification of critical transactions, missing potential double-spending or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [txns_to_skip bypass] Can the txns_to_skip list be abused to skip verification of malicious transactions, allowing fraudulent transactions to be accepted as valid in the backup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: ReplayVerifyCoordinator::new()] [Waypoint trust] Are trusted_waypoints_opt validated against authoritative sources, or can an attacker inject malicious waypoints to make incorrect replay results appear valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Module validation bypass] Does validate_modules flag properly verify Move bytecode safety during replay, or can skipping validation allow malicious modules to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Lazy quit exploitation] Can the lazy_quit flag allow replay to continue despite detecting mismatches, accumulating multiple errors that mask a systematic attack pattern? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Process exit code manipulation] Since the process exits with specific codes (1, 2) for different errors, can an attacker use these exit codes to fingerprint vulnerabilities or bypass monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: AptosDB::open_kv_only()] [DB corruption risk] Does opening the database in non-read-only mode during replay risk corrupting the live database if replay operations inadvertently write data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Concurrency exploitation] Can concurrent_downloads and replay_concurrency_level be set to extreme values to cause resource exhaustion or race conditions during replay verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Metadata cache poisoning] Can corrupted metadata_cache_opt cause replay to verify against wrong transaction data, missing discrepancies that indicate backup corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Enum: ReplayError::TxnMismatch] [Error suppression] Can systematic transaction mismatches be hidden or aggregated in ways that make it difficult to detect coordinated attacks across multiple transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Version::MAX exploitation] Does end_version defaulting to Version::MAX cause issues when replaying extremely large version ranges, potentially causing integer overflow or timeout issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Rocksdb configuration] Can malicious rocksdb_opt settings be used to degrade replay performance, cause crashes, or exhaust disk space during verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_verify.rs] [Function: GetRestoreHandler] [Handler isolation] Does the restore handler properly isolate replay operations from live database operations, or can replay corrupt ongoing transaction processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Archive tampering] Can an attacker modify the archived database to inject fake transactions that pass replay verification, enabling historical revisionism of the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: Verifier::verify()] [Transaction mismatch suppression] When ensure_match_transaction_info() detects mismatches, can the error handling logic be exploited to continue processing instead of failing, hiding evidence of tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: Verifier::run()] [Parallel execution race] Can the rayon parallel execution across chunks cause race conditions where different threads access shared state, leading to non-deterministic verification results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/replay_on_archive.rs] [Function: Opt::run()] [Timeout bypass] Can the timeout_secs check be circumvented by pausing the process or manipulating system time, allowing malicious replays to run indefinitely? (Medium)",
