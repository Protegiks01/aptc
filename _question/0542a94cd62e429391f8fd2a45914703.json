  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Thread Safety] While the structs implement Clone, are operations on canonical identities thread-safe? Could concurrent canonicalization of the same URL from different threads cause race conditions in the underlying String allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Send/Sync Bounds] Are these structs safe to send across thread boundaries?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Localhost Variants] Are localhost, 127.0.0.1, [::1], and other loopback representations properly canonicalized to the same identity, or can they create separate cache entries that could be exploited for local privilege escalation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [URL Length Limits] Are there maximum length limits enforced on URLs before canonicalization?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Canonical Identity Length] Is there a maximum length for the resulting canonical identity string?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Query Parameter Handling] The canonicalization uses path() which includes query parameters - can different query strings (e.g., ?ref=main vs ?ref=dev) for the same repository create different canonical identities, fragmenting the cache? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Fragment Handling] URL fragments (#section) are typically not sent to servers - are they included in canonical identities?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Userinfo Handling] Does the canonicalization strip username:password from URLs (RFC 3986 userinfo), or are authentication credentials included in canonical identities, causing credential leakage through cache keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Token Exposure] If URLs contain access tokens in paths or query parameters (e.g., /repos/:owner/:repo?access_token=xxx), are these tokens included in canonical identities and potentially logged or exposed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Serialization Format] If canonical identities are serialized for storage or network transmission, is the serialization format deterministic?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Manifest Injection] If Move package manifests (Move.toml) can specify arbitrary git URLs, can attackers inject specially crafted URLs that exploit canonicalization bugs to achieve remote code execution during package compilation?
