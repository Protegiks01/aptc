  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [URL Injection] Can an attacker supply a malicious scheme parameter containing special characters (e.g., 'http://evil.com#') that bypasses URL validation in Url::parse(), allowing URL injection attacks that redirect local testnet API calls to attacker-controlled endpoints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [SSRF Potential] Does the function validate that the scheme parameter is restricted to safe protocols (http/https), or can an attacker inject dangerous schemes like 'file://', 'ftp://', or 'gopher://' to perform Server-Side Request Forgery attacks against the local testnet environment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Format String Attack] Can the format! macro on line 13 be exploited if the scheme parameter contains format string specifiers or escape sequences that could lead to memory corruption or information disclosure when constructing the URL string? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [URL Parsing Bypass] Does Url::parse() on line 14 properly validate the constructed URL string, or can crafted socket_addr values combined with scheme manipulation create malformed URLs that bypass security checks in downstream API handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Scheme Validation] Is there any validation that the scheme parameter contains only alphanumeric characters, or can injection of special characters like newlines, null bytes, or control characters corrupt the URL construction and lead to protocol confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Bracket Injection] When handling SocketAddr::V6 on line 11, can an attacker exploit the IPv6 address formatting to inject malicious content through specially crafted IPv6 addresses that escape the bracket notation and manipulate the URL structure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Zone ID Attack] Does the IPv6 formatting properly handle zone identifiers (e.g., fe80::1%eth0), or can attackers inject malicious zone IDs containing special characters that break URL parsing or enable injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Compressed Form] Can attackers exploit IPv6 address compression (::) to create ambiguous or malformed addresses that are interpreted differently by URL parsers versus socket address handlers, leading to security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Bracket Mismatch] If an IPv6 address contains characters that look like brackets or can be confused with URL syntax, can this lead to bracket mismatch vulnerabilities where the closing bracket on line 11 is interpreted incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv6 Dual Stack] Does the function handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (::ffff:192.0.2.1) correctly, or can attackers use this to bypass IPv4 vs IPv6 specific security policies in the local testnet configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Port Overflow] Can an attacker supply a socket_addr with a port value that, when converted to string and concatenated on line 13, causes integer overflow or unexpected behavior in downstream URL consumers that parse the port differently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Port Injection] Does socket_addr.port() on line 13 properly sanitize the port value, or can special port numbers (0, 65535, or reserved ports) create security issues when the URL is used to connect to local testnet services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Port Confusion] If the port value is 0 (which is valid for SocketAddr), does this create ambiguous URLs where the port is omitted or interpreted as default, leading to connection to unintended services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv4 Octet Injection] When formatting IPv4 addresses on line 10, can attackers exploit alternative IPv4 representations (hex, octal, decimal) to bypass security filters that expect standard dotted-decimal notation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv4 Localhost Bypass] If the socket_addr contains 127.0.0.1 or other localhost addresses, does this create security issues where local testnet URLs can be used to access unintended local services or bypass network isolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [IPv4 Private Range] Does the function validate that the IPv4 address is within expected private ranges for local testnet (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, etc.), or can public IPs be injected to redirect connections outside the local testnet environment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Panic on Parse Failure] Does the '?' operator on line 14 properly propagate Url::parse() errors, or can parse failures cause unexpected panics that crash the local testnet process and lead to denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Error Information Leak] When Url::parse() returns an error, does the error message expose sensitive information about the internal URL structure or local testnet configuration that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Unchecked Result] Are there any code paths where the Result<Url> return value is not properly handled by callers, leading to potential panics or security issues when URL construction fails? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Unicode Handling] If the scheme parameter contains unicode characters or non-ASCII bytes, can this cause issues in URL encoding/decoding that lead to security vulnerabilities when the URL is used in HTTP requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Memory Leak] Does the function properly deallocate all intermediate strings created during URL construction, or can repeated calls with various inputs lead to memory leaks affecting local testnet stability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [URL Canonicalization] Does Url::parse() canonicalize the constructed URL consistently, or can different but equivalent socket addresses produce different URL representations that bypass equality checks or security policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/utils.rs] [Function: socket_addr_to_url()] [Case Sensitivity] Is the scheme parameter treated case-insensitively as per RFC 3986, or can attackers use mixed-case schemes (e.g., 'HtTp') to bypass scheme validation in calling code? (Low)",
