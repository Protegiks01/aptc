  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Determinism: Scope depth] [Depth calculation divergence] Can floating-point errors or platform differences in usize arithmetic cause current_depth() to return different values across validators running on different architectures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Determinism: Error propagation] [Non-deterministic errors] The Result returns from alias operations - can error handling differences across validators cause some to fail compilation while others succeed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Memory: UniqueMap operations] [Use-after-free] Can the remove() followed by add() pattern in alias functions cause use-after-free if UniqueMap internally holds pointers that aren't properly invalidated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Memory: Vec unused vector] [Buffer overflow] Can the unused vector be manipulated to grow unboundedly, causing heap overflow and memory corruption in long-running compilation sessions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Memory: Clone overhead] [Memory exhaustion] The add_and_shadow_all() function clones entire AliasMap - can deeply nested scopes cause exponential memory growth leading to OOM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Memory: ModuleIdent cloning] [Reference counting] ModuleIdent structures are cloned multiple times - can reference counting bugs in underlying types cause memory leaks or dangling references?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Memory: Tuple storage] [Alignment issues] The ((ModuleIdent, Name), bool) tuples stored in members - can incorrect alignment cause memory corruption on certain architectures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Integer: ScopeDepth type] [usize overflow] ScopeDepth is defined as usize - can extremely deep scope nesting cause overflow when incrementing depth values, wrapping to 0 and breaking shadowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Integer: unused.len()] [Length overflow] The current_depth() returns unused.len() - can Vec length overflow on 32-bit systems cause incorrect depth calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Integer: Depth arithmetic] [Off-by-one errors] The assertion outer_scope.current_depth() + 1 == inner_scope.current_depth() - can off-by-one errors in depth tracking cause this to fail incorrectly?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/aliases.rs] [Concurrency: Mutable borrows] [Data race] Functions like module_alias_get() take &mut self - if AliasMap is shared across threads without proper locking, can data races cause memory corruption?
