  "[File: consensus/src/round_manager_fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_proposal()] [Deserialization Attack] Can a malicious fuzzing input trigger memory corruption or buffer overflow during serde_json::from_slice() deserialization of ProposalMsg, potentially causing validator crashes or RCE? (Critical)",
