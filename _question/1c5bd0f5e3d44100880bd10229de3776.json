  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious `path` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (../, ../../, etc.) that, when passed to `reroot_path()`, allows reading or writing files outside the intended package directory? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] If the `path` parameter points to a symbolic link, does `reroot_path()` follow it without validation, potentially allowing an attacker to escape the package directory and access arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [TOCTOU Race] Between the call to `reroot_path()` at line 16 and the subsequent operations, can an attacker replace the package directory with a symlink to cause a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Canonicalization Bypass] Does `reroot_path()` properly handle edge cases like `/./`, `/path//to`, or Unicode normalization issues that could bypass path validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Malicious Git Repository] When `fetch_deps_only` is true (line 17), can an attacker specify a malicious git URL in Move.toml that downloads and executes arbitrary code through git hooks during `download_deps_for_package()`? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git Command Injection] In the dependency download flow (line 22), can an attacker inject shell commands through crafted git URLs, repository names, or revision strings that get passed unsanitized to git subprocess commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Man-in-the-Middle] Does `download_deps_for_package()` verify git repository integrity (e.g., via SSH host key verification or HTTPS certificate pinning), or can an attacker perform a MITM attack to inject malicious dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Dependency Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the dependency resolution order to cause the system to download a malicious package from a public repository instead of an intended private/internal dependency? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Typosquatting] Does the build system validate package names against a whitelist or registry, or can an attacker exploit typosquatting by registering packages with names similar to legitimate dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git Submodule Attack] If dependencies use git submodules, are these recursively validated, or can an attacker inject malicious code through compromised submodules? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Test Mode Privilege Escalation] At lines 19-21, when `test_mode` is true, `dev_mode` is automatically enabled. Can an attacker exploit this to access dev-only dependencies or addresses in production builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [BuildConfig Tampering] Can an attacker modify the `BuildConfig` parameter to change security-critical settings like `skip_fetch_latest_git_deps`, `force_recompilation`, or `additional_named_addresses` to inject malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Dev Dependencies in Production] If `dev_mode` or `test_mode` flags are incorrectly set in production, can this expose test-only code paths, mock implementations, or debug features that compromise security? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Concurrent Build Race] If multiple processes call `execute()` simultaneously on the same package directory, can race conditions in file creation/modification lead to corrupted builds or arbitrary code execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Lock File Race] Does the package lock mechanism properly prevent TOCTOU issues when multiple threads/processes check for and create lock files, potentially allowing concurrent modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Stdout Race Condition] Multiple calls writing to `std::io::stdout()` at lines 22 and 25 - can concurrent writes cause interleaved output that could be exploited for log injection or output confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [MOVE_HOME Override] Can an attacker set the MOVE_HOME environment variable to a malicious directory containing trojan dependencies that get loaded during `download_deps_for_package()`? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [PATH Manipulation] Can an attacker modify the PATH environment variable to point to a malicious `git` binary that executes arbitrary code during dependency downloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [LD_PRELOAD Attack] On Unix systems, can an attacker use LD_PRELOAD or similar mechanisms to inject malicious shared libraries during the build process? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Malicious Move Code] When `compile_package()` is called at line 25, does it properly sandbox the Move compiler to prevent malicious Move source code from exploiting compiler bugs to achieve code execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Compiler Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a malicious Move package that causes `compile_package()` to consume unbounded memory or CPU, leading to denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/build.rs] [Function: execute()] [Build Artifact Injection] After compilation at line 25, are the resulting artifacts (bytecode, ABIs) validated before use, or can an attacker inject malicious bytecode by manipulating the build directory? (High)",
