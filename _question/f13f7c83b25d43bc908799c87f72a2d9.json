  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Struct: SafetyLogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Does the SafetyLogSchema struct expose sensitive validator private key material, consensus secrets, or cryptographic nonces through the 'error' field when logging Error events, potentially allowing attackers to compromise validator security? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Struct: SafetyLogSchema] [Privacy Violation] Can the 'author' field in SafetyLogSchema be exploited to correlate validator identities across epochs, enabling targeted attacks or censorship of specific validators by malicious network observers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Struct: SafetyLogSchema] [Audit Trail Tampering] Are SafetyLogSchema log entries cryptographically signed or integrity-protected, or can a Byzantine validator manipulate their local logs to hide double-signing attempts and evade slashing penalties? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Struct: SafetyLogSchema] [State Reconstruction Attack] If an attacker gains read access to logs containing round, preferred_round, last_voted_round, and highest_timeout_round values, can they reconstruct the complete consensus state to predict future validator behavior and exploit timing vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Struct: SafetyLogSchema] [Waypoint Exposure] Does logging the 'waypoint' field expose critical bootstrap state information that could allow an attacker to forge sync points or mislead new validators joining the network about the canonical chain state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Field: error] [Error Message Injection] Can malicious input in safety-rules operations cause the Error type to contain attacker-controlled strings that get logged via the 'error' field, enabling log injection attacks or misleading forensic investigations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Field: epoch] [Epoch Confusion Attack] If epoch values are logged without proper validation, can a Byzantine validator inject false epoch numbers in logs to create confusion during epoch transitions and mask consensus safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Field: round] [Round Manipulation Detection] Are round number logs sufficient to detect when a Byzantine validator attempts to vote in multiple rounds simultaneously, or can the absence of atomic logging allow double-voting to go undetected in audit trails? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Function: SafetyLogSchema::new()] [Missing Validation] Does the new() constructor validate that the LogEntry and LogEvent combination is semantically valid (e.g., preventing Initialize+Error combinations that should be impossible), or can invalid log states be created that confuse monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Function: SafetyLogSchema::new()] [Initialization Safety] When creating a new SafetyLogSchema with all optional fields set to None, can the absence of critical fields like 'round' or 'epoch' in safety-critical log entries cause forensic analysis tools to miss consensus violations during incident response? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Function: SafetyLogSchema::new()] [Memory Safety] Does the new() function properly handle all edge cases when creating log schemas, or can memory safety issues arise when logging extremely large round numbers or malformed waypoints that could crash validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::ConsensusState] [State Exposure] When logging ConsensusState events, does the system expose complete internal consensus state (including voting history and QC chains) that could allow attackers to reverse-engineer safety rule logic and find bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::ConstructAndSignVoteTwoChain] [Double-Signing Detection] Are ConstructAndSignVoteTwoChain log entries atomic and tamper-proof enough to detect if a validator signs conflicting votes for different blocks at the same round, or can log races allow double-signing to succeed undetected? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::ConstructAndSignOrderVote] [Order Vote Manipulation] Can missing or incomplete logging of ConstructAndSignOrderVote operations allow a Byzantine validator to violate order vote safety rules without leaving audit evidence, potentially causing consensus forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::Epoch] [Epoch Transition Attacks] During epoch changes, if Epoch log entries don't capture the complete validator set transition atomically, can attackers exploit logging gaps to mask validator set manipulation or stake redistribution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::HighestTimeoutRound] [Timeout Certificate Forgery] If HighestTimeoutRound logs can be manipulated or replayed, can an attacker force unnecessary timeouts by convincing validators they're behind in rounds, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::Initialize] [Initialization State Exposure] Does logging Initialize events expose validator private keys, persistent storage locations, or cryptographic seed material that could compromise validator security if logs are exfiltrated? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::KeyReconciliation] [Key Material Leakage] Can KeyReconciliation log entries inadvertently log portions of cryptographic key material, key derivation paths, or vault tokens that would allow an attacker to compromise validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::LastVotedRound] [Vote History Tampering] If LastVotedRound logs are not strictly monotonic and tamper-proof, can a Byzantine validator rewind their last_voted_round to violate the first voting rule and create conflicting vote chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::OneChainRound] [One-Chain Safety Violation] Are OneChainRound log entries sufficient to prove that validators respect the one-chain safety invariant, or can logging gaps allow violations that lead to consensus forks without audit trail evidence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::PreferredRound] [Preferred Round Rollback] Can a validator manipulate PreferredRound logs to justify voting for blocks that violate the second voting rule (preferred round constraint), enabling safety violations that appear legitimate in audits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::SignProposal] [Proposal Signing Forgery] If SignProposal log entries don't include cryptographic proof of the signed proposal content, can a Byzantine leader claim they signed legitimate proposals while actually distributing conflicting blocks to different validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::SignTimeoutWithQC] [Timeout QC Manipulation] When logging SignTimeoutWithQC events, if the quorum certificate content isn't fully captured, can attackers hide the fact they're signing timeouts for rounds where valid proposals exist, disrupting liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::State] [Complete State Disclosure] Does logging State events expose the complete internal safety-rules persistent state including all historical voting decisions, potentially allowing attackers to identify and exploit edge cases in state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::Waypoint] [Waypoint Manipulation] If Waypoint log entries can be forged or replayed, can an attacker trick validators into accepting false waypoints during recovery, causing them to sync to an incorrect fork and lose funds? (Critical)"
