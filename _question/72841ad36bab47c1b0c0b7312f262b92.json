  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [Path traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious package_path with directory traversal sequences (../, symlinks, absolute paths) through the --path/-p flag to access sensitive files outside the intended package directory, potentially reading private keys or validator configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [Path validation] Does the package_path Option<PathBuf> undergo canonicalization and validation before being passed to command execution functions, or can attackers exploit race conditions (TOCTOU) between path validation and file access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [Input sanitization] Are there bounds checks on the verbose flag or build_config parameters to prevent integer overflow or unexpected behavior when parsing malformed CLI arguments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [BuildConfig injection] Can an attacker manipulate the build_config flattened struct to inject malicious compiler options, dependency paths, or feature flags that could compromise the compilation process or execute arbitrary code during build? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Path injection] When package_path is None and defaults are used, does the function properly validate the current working directory, or can an attacker position malicious Move.toml files to hijack the build process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Type: NativeFunctionRecord] [Native injection] Can an attacker register malicious native functions through the natives Vec parameter by exploiting the (AccountAddress, Identifier, Identifier, NativeFunction) tuple structure to override legitimate native functions or inject backdoors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Native validation] Does run_cli() validate the natives vector for duplicate entries, conflicting addresses, or malformed identifiers that could cause undefined behavior or memory corruption in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_cli()] [Native function hijacking] When natives are passed to move_cli(), are they cryptographically verified or authenticated to prevent a malicious user from replacing system-critical native functions with compromised implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Type: NativeFunctionRecord] [Memory safety] Does the NativeFunction type in the tuple guarantee memory safety, or can FFI boundaries be exploited to cause buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities when native functions are invoked? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Genesis manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious genesis ChangeSet that initializes the state with invalid values, unauthorized accounts, or infinite token balances that persist through test execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_cli()] [State poisoning] Does the genesis ChangeSet undergo validation for consistency, resource safety, and proper Move type constraints before being applied, or can it introduce corrupted state that affects all subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Genesis integrity] Are there checksums or cryptographic signatures required for the genesis parameter to ensure it hasn't been tampered with between creation and application? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Gas bypass] The TODO comment at line 78-80 mentions CostTable only affects sandbox runs but not unit tests - can an attacker exploit this inconsistency to write tests that pass with unrealistic gas consumption, hiding DoS vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Cost table manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious cost_table with zero or negative gas costs to effectively disable gas metering and execute unbounded computation during test execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_cli()] [Gas metering bypass] Does the cost_table reference get validated for reasonable ranges and non-zero values before being cloned and passed to test execution, or can invalid values crash the VM or cause integer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Unit test gas inconsistency] Since unit tests use a different cost table than the CostTable parameter, can developers write malicious code that appears safe in tests but causes out-of-gas failures or DoS in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Command injection] Does the match statement at lines 81-96 properly isolate command execution, or can state from one command execution leak into another when run_cli() is called multiple times in the same process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Error propagation] Do all command execute() methods properly propagate errors with Result<()>, or can some commands silently fail and return Ok(()) when they should fail, masking security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Command] [Variant exhaustiveness] If new command variants are added to the Command enum without updating run_cli(), could the compiler fail to enforce exhaustive matching, potentially causing unhandled command execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Test command privilege] The Test command receives natives, genesis, and cost_table parameters that other commands don't - can this asymmetry be exploited to execute privileged operations through the test interface that bypass normal security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Build execution] When executing Command::Build at line 82, does the build process validate Move.toml for malicious dependencies, git URLs with credential injection, or path dependencies that could lead to arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Build output injection] Can an attacker control the build output directory through build_config to overwrite system files, inject malicious bytecode into trusted locations, or create symlink attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_BUILD_DIR] [Directory traversal] The constant DEFAULT_BUILD_DIR is set to '.' - can relative path resolution be exploited when combined with package_path to write build artifacts outside the intended directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Coverage data injection] When executing Command::Coverage at line 83, can an attacker provide malicious coverage data files that exploit parsing vulnerabilities to achieve code execution or information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Coverage file access] Does the coverage command properly sandbox file access to prevent reading arbitrary files or writing coverage reports to sensitive locations? (Medium)"
