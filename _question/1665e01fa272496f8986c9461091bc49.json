  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: StdoutWriter::write_buferred()] [Buffer Overflow] Does BufWriter at line 696-702 have bounded capacity, or could an attacker trigger unbounded log buffering causing memory exhaustion and validator OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: StdoutWriter::write_buferred()] [Error Swallowing] The unwrap_or_default() at line 714 silently ignores write errors - can this hide situations where logs are not actually written due to stdout redirection failures or disk full conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: StdoutWriter::write_buferred()] [Flush Missing] Is BufWriter ever explicitly flushed, or could buffered logs remain in memory during validator crashes, losing critical evidence of consensus violations or Byzantine attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::new()] [File Creation Panic] Does the expect() at line 729 mean validator startup will panic if log file cannot be created due to permissions or disk space - could an attacker cause startup failures by manipulating filesystem state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::new()] [Append Mode Race] When opening file in append mode at line 726, can multiple validator processes race to write to the same log file, causing interleaved or corrupted output that makes audit logs unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::write()] [Write Lock Blocking] Does acquiring write() lock at line 739 block all concurrent logging, and could an attacker trigger slow disk I/O to make all validator threads wait on the file lock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::write()] [Error Message DoS] When writeln! fails at line 739-741, does eprintln! write to stderr without rate limiting, and could repeated failures cause unbounded error logging that fills disk or degrades performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::write()] [Disk Full] If the log file's filesystem runs out of space, does writeln! failure at line 739 cause the log to be dropped silently, potentially losing evidence of consensus attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: FileWriter::write_buferred()] [Buffer Inconsistency] Why does write_buferred() call write() directly at line 745 instead of using a buffer - does this indicate incomplete implementation that could cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: text_format()] [Format Error Propagation] If any write!() macro fails during text formatting (lines 757-776), does the error propagate correctly, or could partial format strings be logged causing parser confusion in log analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: text_format()] [JSON Injection] When calling serde_json::to_string() at line 775, if entry.data contains attacker-controlled strings with special characters, can this break the log line format causing parsing errors in security monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: text_format()] [Newline Injection] Can attacker-controlled data in entry.message or entry.data at lines 770-776 contain newline characters that split a single log entry into multiple apparent entries, confusing log parsers and security analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: json_format()] [Serialization Failure] When serde_json::to_string() fails at line 783-785, STRUCT_LOG_PARSE_ERROR_COUNT is incremented but what caused the failure is unknown - can this hide Byzantine validator behavior in logs that cannot be serialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: json_format()] [Metric Naming] Why is STRUCT_LOG_PARSE_ERROR_COUNT used for serialization errors at line 787 when it suggests parsing errors - does this indicate metric confusion that could mislead monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: json_format()] [Error Context Loss] The TODO comment at line 786 admits context is lost when serialization fails - could this make it impossible to debug why certain consensus events cannot be logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerFilterUpdater::run()] [Interval Drift] Does tokio::time::interval at line 810 handle timer drift correctly, or could system clock changes cause filters to be updated at incorrect intervals, affecting security log capture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerFilterUpdater::run()] [Infinite Loop] The loop at line 811 runs forever without exit conditions - if validator shutdown occurs, could this task continue running and prevent clean process termination? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerFilterUpdater::update_filter()] [Environment Race] Does build_filter() at line 820 read environment variables without synchronization, and could concurrent validator threads modifying env vars cause race conditions in filter construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: LoggerFilterUpdater::update_filter()] [TODO Comment] The TODO at line 819 suggests filters are rebuilt even when env vars haven't changed - could this cause unnecessary lock contention and performance degradation during consensus-critical periods? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Constant: FILTER_REFRESH_INTERVAL] [Refresh Timing] Is the 5-minute refresh interval at line 47-48 appropriate, or could attackers exploit the delay between changing RUST_LOG_TELEMETRY and filter updates to hide malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: test unsafe blocks] [Environment Corruption] The unsafe set_var() calls at lines 1155, 1169, 1181 modify global environment in tests - could these tests running concurrently corrupt validator configuration if test and production code share the same process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Function: test_logger_filter_updater()] [Test Race Condition] Do the unsafe set_var() calls properly synchronize with filter reading, or could race conditions cause non-deterministic test failures that hide real concurrency bugs in production code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Architecture: Async Logging] [Message Reordering] Can log entries be reordered when sent through the channel at line 559 versus printed synchronously at line 554, causing local and telemetry logs to have different event orderings that break audit correlation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Architecture: Async Logging] [Lost on Crash] When validator crashes, are buffered logs in the channel or BufWriter lost, potentially hiding the root cause of consensus failures or Byzantine attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/aptos_logger.rs] [Architecture: Thread Spawn] [Thread Resource Limit] If the OS limits threads and thread::spawn at line 462 fails, is this detected and handled gracefully, or will validators silently fail to log consensus operations? (High)"
