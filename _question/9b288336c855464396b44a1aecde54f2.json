  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: InputIdx] [Type Safety] Could using a bare usize type alias for InputIdx without newtype pattern allow confusion between InputIdx and OutputIdx values in calling code, potentially leading to incorrect transaction ordering logic that violates consensus determinism? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: OutputIdx] [Type Safety] Does the lack of a distinct newtype wrapper for OutputIdx allow accidental arithmetic operations or comparisons between incompatible index types, potentially causing transaction shuffler state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: InputIdx] [Integer Overflow] Since InputIdx is defined as usize, can an attacker submit enough transactions to cause input_idx to overflow on 32-bit systems, leading to index wraparound and transaction reordering vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: OutputIdx] [Integer Overflow] Can output_idx overflow on systems with smaller pointer sizes, and would such overflow cause the delayed queue priority ordering to break, potentially allowing transaction censorship? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: InputIdx/OutputIdx] [Type Confusion] Are there runtime checks elsewhere that prevent mixing InputIdx and OutputIdx values in comparisons, or could type confusion lead to incorrect delay calculations in the transaction shuffler? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: InputIdx] [Bounds Checking] Does the bare usize type provide sufficient guarantees that InputIdx values used as array/vector indices will be properly bounds-checked, or could out-of-bounds access occur in related modules? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Type Alias: OutputIdx] [Monotonicity] Is there any type-level enforcement that OutputIdx values must be monotonically increasing, or could non-monotonic values cause the DelayedQueue to enter invalid states? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/types.rs] [Module Visibility: pub(crate)] [Access Control] Does pub(crate) visibility provide sufficient encapsulation for these index types, or could malicious code in other consensus crate modules manipulate these indices directly to bypass transaction ordering rules? (Low)"
