  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a malicious RocksdbConfig with max_open_files set to u32::MAX or an extremely large value, causing the validator node to exhaust file descriptors and crash, leading to loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Resource Exhaustion] If config.max_open_files is set to 0 or 1, will RocksDB fail to open necessary column families, causing state corruption or preventing the validator from participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Data Loss] Can config.max_total_wal_size be set to 0 or an extremely small value, causing premature WAL deletion before data is flushed to disk, resulting in permanent state loss during crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Inconsistency] If max_total_wal_size is set to u64::MAX, can unbounded WAL growth cause disk space exhaustion on validator nodes, leading to write failures and state divergence across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Divergence] Are the config.max_open_files and config.max_total_wal_size parameters validated to ensure deterministic behavior across all validators, or can configuration differences cause validators to produce different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Performance DoS] If config.stats_level is set to StatsLevel::All with a very low stats_dump_period_sec (e.g., 1 second), can the statistics collection overhead significantly degrade validator performance, causing timeout failures in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Information Leak] Does enabling statistics via enable_statistics() expose sensitive internal database metrics that could be leveraged by attackers to profile validator behavior or predict state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Integer Overflow] Can config.stats_dump_period_sec be set to u32::MAX or other extreme values that cause integer overflow in RocksDB's internal timing calculations, leading to undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Logic Error] If config.stats_level is Some but stats_dump_period_sec is None, are statistics collected but never dumped, causing unbounded memory growth in the statistics buffer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Corruption] When readonly is false, create_if_missing(true) is called - can this cause the validator to silently create a new empty database if the data directory is accidentally deleted or unmounted, leading to total state loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Corruption] Does create_missing_column_families(true) properly validate that all expected column families exist before proceeding, or can missing critical column families cause silent data corruption when writes succeed to some but not all families? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Safety Violation] If a Byzantine validator intentionally runs with readonly=true while participating in consensus, can they avoid persisting committed blocks while still sending votes, potentially causing safety violations when they restart with inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Data Loss] When readonly is true, are write operations silently ignored or do they return errors? Can this cause transaction execution results to be lost while the validator continues participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Environment Injection] If the env parameter is provided by untrusted configuration, can a malicious Env implementation intercept all database operations, leak state data, or inject corrupted data into the state store? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Thread Safety] Is the Env object thread-safe? If multiple validators or database instances share the same Env, can race conditions in environment operations cause data corruption or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Resource Leak] If set_env() is called multiple times with different Env instances, are previous environments properly cleaned up, or can this cause resource leaks and eventual node failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Network Partition] If different validators use different max_open_files configurations, can this cause some validators to fail opening databases during high transaction volume while others succeed, leading to temporary network partitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Divergence] Can differences in stats_level configuration across validators cause non-deterministic timing behavior that affects transaction execution order in parallel execution environments, leading to different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Consensus Failure] If stats_dump_period_sec causes frequent disk I/O spikes on some validators but not others, can this create timing differences that cause them to miss consensus deadlines and get excluded from the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Inconsistency] Are all RocksDB Options settings deterministic across different hardware architectures and OS platforms, or can platform-specific defaults cause state divergence when validators run on heterogeneous infrastructure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Data Loss] If a validator crashes while WAL is at max_total_wal_size limit, can pending writes be lost because the WAL cannot grow, resulting in missing transactions and state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Corruption on Recovery] When a database is reopened after a crash with readonly=false, does create_if_missing(true) interfere with RocksDB's corruption detection, potentially allowing corrupted data to be treated as valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Fork] If a validator restarts with different max_total_wal_size after a crash, can replay of WAL logs behave differently, causing the validator to fork from the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Resource Exhaustion] During recovery from a corrupted database, if create_missing_column_families(true) repeatedly attempts to create many column families, can this exhaust memory or disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Upgrade Risk] If max_open_files is reduced in a configuration update, can existing databases that require more file handles fail to open, causing validators to go offline during network upgrades? (High)"
