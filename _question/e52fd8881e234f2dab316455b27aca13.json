  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Constants: RECENT_PROGRESS_SAMPLING_RATE] [Configuration] Are sampling rates (1 second for recent, 60 seconds for old) appropriate for all use cases, or can high-frequency updates cause recent_samples to fill too quickly and lose important data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: insert_active_stream() + update_stream_progress()] [State Inconsistency] Can insert_active_stream() be called after update_stream_progress() has already been called for a stream ID, causing the progress samples to be reset and lose existing tracking data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: remove_active_stream() + get_active_streams()] [Stale Data] Can remove_active_stream() leave the stream partially visible in get_active_streams() due to DashMap's concurrent semantics, causing heartbeat to report removed streams as still active? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: heartbeat()] [Inconsistent Snapshot] When heartbeat() collects multiple pieces of state (line 252-275), can the non-atomic collection cause GrpcManager to receive inconsistent snapshot of service state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: to_proto()] [Panic in Conversion] Can system_time_to_proto() conversion panic or fail for extreme timestamp values, causing to_proto() to panic during heartbeat preparation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: get_grpc_manager_client_for_request()] [Thread RNG Panic] Can thread_rng() or choose() panic under any circumstances (e.g., during shutdown), causing client request failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Infinite Loop] The start() function runs an infinite loop without any shutdown mechanism - can this prevent graceful service shutdown or cause resource leaks during restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Sleep Duration] Is 1 second sleep between heartbeat iterations (line 164) appropriate for all scenarios, or should it be configurable to handle different latency requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/connection_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Bootstrap Timeout] The initialization loop (lines 132-140) has no timeout - can a permanently unavailable GrpcManager cause new() to never complete, hanging service initialization? (High)"
