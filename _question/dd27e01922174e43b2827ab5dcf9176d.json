  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_comma_list()] [Missing Comma Errors] If an attacker omits commas between list items, does the error handling properly reject the input, or can malformed lists bypass validation through error recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_comma_list()] [End Token Confusion] Can an attacker provide input where the end_token appears in unexpected positions, causing the parser to prematurely terminate list parsing and accept incomplete types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_comma_list()] [List Length Limits] Is there a maximum length limit for parsed lists, or can an attacker provide extremely long comma-separated lists that cause memory exhaustion or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_comma_list()] [Recursive List Parsing] When parsing nested structures (e.g., vector<vector<u8>>), can the recursive comma list parsing cause stack overflow through excessive nesting depth? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_string()] [Token Type Confusion] Can an attacker provide tokens that aren't Name tokens but are similar enough to bypass the type check and be accepted as valid strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_string()] [Empty String Handling] Does the parser accept empty strings as valid Name tokens, and if so, can this cause issues in contexts where non-empty strings are expected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_string()] [String Length Limits] Is there a maximum length for parsed strings, or can attackers provide extremely long identifier strings that cause memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: Parser::next()] [Token Exhaustion] When the iterator runs out of tokens unexpectedly, does the error message reveal implementation details that could help attackers craft bypass exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: Parser::peek()] [Iterator State Corruption] Can concurrent access to the Peekable iterator cause state corruption that allows tokens to be read multiple times or skipped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: Parser::consume()] [Token Mismatch Exploitation] When token consumption fails due to mismatch, can an attacker use the error information to probe the parser state and craft inputs that bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: Parser::new()] [Iterator Initialization] Can an attacker provide a custom token iterator that exhibits unexpected behavior (e.g., infinite iteration) that causes the parser to hang? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: tokenize()] [String Slicing Overflow] When advancing through the input string using &s[n..], can an attacker provide input where token length 'n' exceeds remaining string length, causing a panic or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: tokenize()] [UTF-8 Boundary Violation] Does string slicing properly handle UTF-8 character boundaries, or can multi-byte characters cause slicing to panic when 'n' lands in the middle of a character? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: tokenize()] [Infinite Tokenization] Can malformed input cause next_token to return zero-length tokens, creating an infinite loop in the tokenization while loop? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: tokenize()] [Token Vector Memory] Can an attacker provide input that generates an extremely large number of tokens, causing the token vector to exhaust available memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: tokenize()] [Error Propagation] When next_token returns an error, does tokenize properly propagate it, or can error conditions be silently ignored allowing partial parsing? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [EOF Consumption Bypass] After successful parsing, if EOF consumption fails, does this indicate unconsumed input that could represent a security vulnerability? (Medium)",
