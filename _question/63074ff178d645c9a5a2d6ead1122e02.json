  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Voting power calculation] Does verify_signatures() correctly account for validator voting power, or can low-stake validators forge signatures to appear as high-stake quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator removal] Can validators removed from the set in epoch N still have their signatures accepted for epoch N blocks, enabling removed validators to participate in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Duplicate signatures] Does verify_signatures() check for duplicate signatures from the same validator, or can a validator sign multiple times to amplify their voting power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: commit_info()] [Sync target manipulation] When nodes sync using WrappedLedgerInfo as sync targets, can attackers provide WrappedLedgerInfo with invalid commit_info to misdirect synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: create_merged_with_executed_state()] [Sync race condition] During state sync, can race conditions between creating merged states and actual execution cause state root inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Round comparison edge case] The TODO comment mentions comparing ledger_info().round() vs certified_block().round() - can attackers exploit any discrepancy between these values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Struct fields] [Timestamp manipulation] Can vote_data timestamps differ from signed_ledger_info timestamps, and can this be exploited for timestamp-based attacks or consensus timing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify_consensus_data_hash()] [Error message leakage] The error message includes vote_hash details - can this information leakage be used to aid hash collision search or cryptanalysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: dummy()] [Fuzzing exploitation] Since dummy() is available with fuzzing features, can malicious fuzz inputs exploit the consensus layer by creating edge cases in dummy object handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Struct: WrappedLedgerInfo] [Cache poisoning] If WrappedLedgerInfo objects are cached by hash, can attackers create hash collisions to poison caches with invalid consensus data? (Medium)"
