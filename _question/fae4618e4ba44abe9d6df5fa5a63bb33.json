  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Log flooding] Can attackers send high volumes of requests just below error threshold (4xx codes) to flood debug logs, filling disk space and potentially causing node failures or obscuring real security events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/log.rs] [Function: logger()] [Timing attack] Can the elapsed duration logging provide attackers with precise timing information about internal operations, enabling timing-based attacks to distinguish between different error conditions or extract sensitive data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::serve()] [TLS validation bypass] Can an attacker exploit the asymmetric validation where tls_cert_path is checked but tls_key_path uses unwrap() without validation, causing panics when TLS is misconfigured and potentially exposing the API over unencrypted HTTP? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::serve()] [Panic on TLS misconfiguration] Does the unwrap() on tls_key_path create a panic condition that crashes the API server if the key file path is None when cert_path is Some, causing denial of service for all API users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::serve()] [Downgrade attack] Can an attacker trigger conditions where the TLS-enabled path fails, causing a silent fallback to the unencrypted HTTP path and exposing sensitive blockchain data in transit? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::new()] [Configuration injection] Can malicious ApiConfig values inject path traversal sequences in tls_cert_path or tls_key_path to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially extracting validator keys or other secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Struct: WebServer] [State inconsistency] Can the WebServer struct be cloned with partial TLS configuration (cert but no key or vice versa) creating servers with inconsistent security postures across the application? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::serve()] [Missing TLS validation] Are the TLS certificate and key files validated for correctness, expiration, or proper format before use, or can invalid/expired certificates cause service failures during runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: WebServer::serve()] [Concurrent access] Can multiple concurrent calls to serve() with different TLS configurations on the same port cause race conditions or undefined behavior in the underlying warp server? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: From<ApiConfig>] [Trust boundary violation] Does the From trait implementation implicitly trust ApiConfig values without validation, allowing configuration files to inject malicious paths that could lead to file disclosure or code execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Struct: WebServer address] [Port exhaustion] Can attackers configure multiple WebServer instances on sequential ports to exhaust available port space, preventing legitimate API servers from binding and causing denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/lib.rs] [Module: error + response] [State inconsistency] Can Error responses include aptos_ledger_version that differs from Response headers' X_APTOS_LEDGER_VERSION, causing clients to receive contradictory blockchain state information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/lib.rs] [Module: response + webserver] [TLS downgrade] Can responses sent over non-TLS connections leak sensitive ledger information that should only be transmitted over encrypted channels, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/lib.rs] [Module: log + error] [Information correlation] Can combining request logs with error details allow attackers to correlate specific request patterns with internal error conditions, enabling systematic exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/lib.rs] [Module: error + webserver] [Error handling during TLS failure] Are TLS handshake failures properly caught and converted to Error types, or can they panic the server causing complete API unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/lib.rs] [Module: response serialization] [Memory safety] Can the combination of JSON and BCS serialization paths be exploited to trigger different memory allocation patterns that cause fragmentation or exhaustion over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Type: StatusCode conversion] [Panic risk] Can StatusCode::from_u16() returning None on invalid codes cause the unwrap_or fallback to mask critical errors, making it impossible to distinguish between legitimate 500 errors and corrupted error states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/response.rs] [Type: U64 conversion] [Overflow handling] Are U64 to HeaderValue conversions properly bounds-checked, or can they silently wrap/truncate for values exceeding header size limits, causing state confusion in clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Async: serve()] [Resource leak] Can the async serve() function leak resources if it's dropped before completion, leaving the bound socket in a half-open state that prevents future server instances from binding? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/error.rs] [Trait: Reject for Error] [Error handling bypass] Can implementing Reject for Error allow warp's error handling to bypass custom security checks or logging, enabling attackers to hide their exploitation attempts? (Low)",
