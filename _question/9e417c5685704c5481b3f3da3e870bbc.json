  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Empty Breakpoints] What happens when breakpoints.iter().any() is called on an empty set, and is the logic correct for zero breakpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [PC Bounds] Is there validation that pc (program counter) is within valid bounds when iterating code, or could out-of-bounds pc values cause incorrect highlighting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Stack Depth Zero] When stack_depth == 0 in StepOut command, is the error message displayed correctly without causing further errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Trim Behavior] Does trim() on input strings properly handle various whitespace characters (tabs, newlines, unicode spaces) consistently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Empty Input] How is completely empty input (after trimming) handled - is it rejected or does it cause unexpected default behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Long Input] Is there a maximum length for input strings read from stdin, or could extremely long inputs cause buffer overflow or memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Attribute: #[allow(unused)]] [Dead Code] The #[allow(unused)] attributes suggest this code may not be actively used - are there orphaned code paths that could contain undiscovered bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: commands()] [Consistency] Does the commands() function return a complete list of all command variants, or could missing commands cause confusion in documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Command: Step] [Step Count] If Step(0) is provided, does it cause an infinite loop by never decrementing the counter, or is zero handled as a special case? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Command: StepOver] [Stack Comparison] Can the stack_depth >= comparison in StepOver logic be exploited when stack depth changes unexpectedly during stepping? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Command: Continue] [Breakpoint Bypass] Does Continue mode properly re-evaluate breakpoints on every instruction, or could it skip checking breakpoints in certain conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Command: PrintStack] [Output Size] Can PrintStack generate unbounded output for deep call stacks or large code sections, causing terminal flooding or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Command: Breakpoint] [Pattern Matching] Does the starts_with() matching for breakpoints allow setting breakpoints on partial instruction names that could match multiple instructions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Unicode Handling] Are unicode characters in command strings and breakpoint names handled correctly, or could multi-byte characters cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [String Display] Does the Debug formatting of instructions handle non-ASCII characters safely without causing display corruption or encoding errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: parse_number()] [Unwrap Panic] Does the n.unwrap() after parse::<usize>() create a panic path that should be handled more gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Unwrap Chain] Are there other implicit unwrap operations in the chain that could panic under unexpected input conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [BTreeSet Lookup] Does the breakpoints.iter().any() operation scale linearly with breakpoint count, causing performance degradation with many breakpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [String Formatting] Is the repeated format!() and println!() usage in the inner loop efficient, or could it cause significant CPU overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Struct: DebugContext] [Invariant] Are there any invariants between breakpoints and input_checker state that must be maintained, or can they become desynchronized? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Enum: InputChecker] [Variant Transitions] Are all possible state transitions between InputChecker variants valid and safe, or could invalid transitions cause logic errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [Cloning Overhead] Does the .cloned() operation on breakpoint iteration create unnecessary memory allocations that could be avoided? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/debug.rs] [Function: debug_loop()] [String Ownership] Are string ownership and borrowing handled correctly to avoid use-after-free or double-free bugs? (Low)"
