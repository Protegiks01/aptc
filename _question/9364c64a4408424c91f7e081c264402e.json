  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/async_drop_queue.rs] [Usage context] Can a malicious validator create specially crafted blocks or transactions that cause honest validators to enqueue objects with expensive drop operations, causing those validators to lag behind in consensus and potentially miss voting deadlines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/async_drop_queue.rs] [Usage context] If AsyncDropQueue is used to drop cryptographic key material or signature state, can delayed drops cause key material to remain in memory longer than expected, increasing the window for memory scraping attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-drop-helper/src/async_drop_queue.rs] [Usage context] Can an attacker cause AsyncDropQueue to accumulate so many pending drop operations that the validator node runs out of memory and crashes, causing liveness issues if enough validators crash simultaneously? (High)"
