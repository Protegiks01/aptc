  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Column Family Access] The tool accesses specific column families - can it access deprecated or internal column families that contain sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Tombstone Records] Does the tool handle deleted/tombstoned records correctly, or can it resurrect deleted transactions that were removed for security reasons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Snapshot Isolation] Are reads performed with proper snapshot isolation, or can inconsistent reads occur if the database is being written to? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: DirectMempool] [Denial of Service] The bail! error for DirectMempool is unconditional - can an attacker force all blocks to use DirectMempool payload to make the tool always fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: InQuorumStore] [Proof Manipulation] Can an attacker modify proof_with_data.proofs in the database to point to non-existent batches, causing extraction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: InQuorumStoreWithLimit] [Limit Bypass] Does the tool respect the implied limits in InQuorumStoreWithLimit, or can it extract more transactions than intended by consensus rules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: QuorumStoreInlineHybrid] [Hybrid Attack] Can an attacker exploit the combination of inline and quorum store batches to cause the same transaction to appear twice? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: QuorumStoreInlineHybrid] [Version Confusion] The V2 and non-V2 variants are handled identically - can version mismatches cause incorrect data interpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: OptQuorumStore] [Optional Batch Handling] If opt_batches() returns empty iterator, does this hide transactions that should be present? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Payload: OptQuorumStore] [Dual Extraction] Two separate extract_txns_from_quorum_store calls occur - can the ordering between proof_with_data and opt_batches cause transaction sequence violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Cryptography] [Hash Validation] HashValue instances are used as keys without validation - can invalid or zero-value hashes cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Cryptography] [Collision Resistance] If hash collisions exist in batch digests, can transactions from different batches be conflated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Cryptography] [Digest Forging] Can an attacker pre-compute digest values to match specific batches and extract targeted transaction data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Cryptography] [Block ID Manipulation] The block.id() is compared directly - does this use secure equality comparison, or can timing attacks reveal block IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [Lifetime Management] The 'a lifetime in extract_txns_from_block ties all references to all_batches - can premature drops cause use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [Borrow Checker] Multiple mutable and immutable borrows occur - are there any borrow checker bypasses that could cause memory unsafety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [Type Conversion] SignedTransaction -> Transaction conversion via Transaction::UserTransaction - can this lose important type information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [HashMap Type] The all_batches HashMap uses HashValue keys - can hash collision attacks in the standard HashMap implementation cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [Option Handling] Multiple .is_none() checks and .unwrap() calls - can race conditions between check and use cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Type Safety] [Pattern Matching] The payload match is not exhaustive for future payload types - can adding new variants cause compilation to succeed but runtime failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Deserialization] [Block Parsing] Blocks are deserialized from database without validation - can malformed block structures cause crashes or incorrect data extraction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Deserialization] [Batch Parsing] PersistedValue<BatchInfo> is deserialized without checks - can corrupted batch data cause panics in payload() method? (Medium)",
