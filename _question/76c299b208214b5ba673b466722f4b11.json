  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Vendor MIME types] Does the parser reject vendor-specific or experimental MIME types (e.g., 'application/vnd.aptos+json') that might be accepted by mistake and cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Transaction API] In transaction submission endpoints that use AcceptType, can attackers exploit format differences to submit transactions with identical signatures but different execution semantics when decoded as JSON vs BCS? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [State queries] For state query endpoints returning account resources, can requesting BCS format bypass access control checks that are only enforced in JSON serialization paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Gas estimation] Can attackers exploit AcceptType selection to cause gas estimation errors by requesting format conversions that don't accurately reflect on-chain execution costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Event queries] For event endpoints, does requesting BCS format bypass event filtering or pagination limits that are enforced during JSON serialization, enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Module queries] When querying Move modules via API, can BCS format requests bypass module bytecode validation that occurs during JSON conversion, allowing attackers to deploy malicious modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [View functions] For view function execution, does AcceptType affect argument parsing in ways that allow attackers to call view functions with invalid arguments that crash the MoveVM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Table items] When querying table items, can BCS format selection bypass table permission checks or allow direct access to raw storage that should be protected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Ledger info] Does requesting BCS format for ledger info endpoints expose internal node state or consensus data that should be filtered in JSON responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: from_request()] [Error messages] When Accept header parsing fails, do error messages leak sensitive information about supported MIME types, API versioning, or internal routing logic that aids reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Timing attacks] Can attackers use timing analysis on parse_accept() with different MIME type sequences to infer which formats are checked first, potentially revealing API security prioritization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: from_request()] [Stack traces] If an internal error occurs during AcceptType extraction, do stack traces in debug builds expose file paths, function names, or code structure useful for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Diagnostic info] Does the Result type returned contain detailed error context that could reveal API implementation details when propagated to client responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: from_request()] [Async race] In high-concurrency scenarios with many simultaneous requests, can race conditions in Accept header parsing cause requests to receive responses in the wrong format, leading to data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Clone safety] Since AcceptType implements Clone, can shared references to AcceptType across async boundaries cause format confusion if the underlying Accept header is modified mid-request? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: from_request()] [Request mutation] Can concurrent modifications to the Request object during from_request() execution cause AcceptType to be determined from stale or incorrect Accept header values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Thread safety] If AcceptType instances are shared across threads serving different requests, can this lead to responses being serialized in unintended formats causing data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Raw bytes] When BCS format is selected, does the API return raw bytes directly from database without additional validation, potentially exposing corrupted or malicious data structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Deserialization bomb] Can attackers request BCS format for deeply nested structures that cause exponential deserialization time, leading to resource exhaustion and API unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Binary injection] Does BCS format bypass output sanitization that would normally prevent binary data injection in JSON responses, allowing XSS or other client-side attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Type confusion] Can malicious BCS payloads be crafted that deserialize as valid data in the API layer but cause type confusion errors when processed by the MoveVM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Length field attack] In BCS encoding, can attackers exploit length field integer overflows to cause buffer overruns when the API attempts to deserialize large collections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Recursion limit] Does BCS deserialization enforce recursion limits? Can attackers craft deeply recursive BCS structures that cause stack overflow when parsed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Bcs] [Version compatibility] When BCS format is used, can schema version mismatches between API client and server cause silent data corruption or misinterpretation of transaction fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Json] [Precision loss] For Move's U64 and U128 types, does JSON encoding cause precision loss for large numbers, allowing attackers to manipulate transaction amounts through rounding errors? (Critical)"
