  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the output_dir parameter to write pool addresses to arbitrary filesystem locations outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or validator configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Overwrite] Does the write_to_file() call at lines 87-91 check if POOL_ADDRESSES file already exists, or can an attacker trigger repeated executions to overwrite existing pool addresses causing validators to lose access to their stake pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Overwrite] Does the write_to_file() call at lines 92-96 check if EMPLOYEE_POOL_ADDRESSES file already exists, or can repeated execution corrupt employee vesting pool mappings leading to loss of employee funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Atomic Write Failure] If write_to_file() fails between lines 87-91 and 92-96, can this leave the system in an inconsistent state where POOL_ADDRESSES exists but EMPLOYEE_POOL_ADDRESSES doesn't, breaking genesis setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent executions of this tool create race conditions where multiple processes write to the same pool address files simultaneously, causing file corruption or partial writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symbolic Link Attack] If output_dir points to a symbolic link, can an attacker redirect pool address files to arbitrary locations, potentially exposing sensitive validator stake pool addresses to unauthorized parties? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Permission Bypass] Does write_to_file() enforce proper file permissions on the generated YAML files, or could they be world-readable exposing validator and employee pool address mappings to local attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Malicious Git Repository] Can an attacker control the git repository accessed via self.git_options.get_client() at line 52 to inject malicious LAYOUT_FILE data causing incorrect pool address generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git TOCTOU] Between retrieving the Layout at line 53 and employee_vesting_accounts at lines 54-55, can an attacker modify the git repository to create inconsistencies between the two files causing address mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git History Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate git history or branches to serve different LAYOUT_FILE or EMPLOYEE_VESTING_ACCOUNTS_FILE versions to different validators, causing consensus failures at genesis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git Credential Leak] Does the GitOptions expose git credentials or repository URLs in error messages that could be logged, potentially revealing private genesis repository access tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Man-in-the-Middle] If the git client uses unencrypted transport, can an attacker intercept and modify LAYOUT_FILE or EMPLOYEE_VESTING_ACCOUNTS_FILE during retrieval, corrupting genesis pool addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Collision] In the loop at lines 60-66 creating stake pool addresses, can duplicate validator configurations with identical owner/operator pairs cause address collisions in the BTreeMap, silently overwriting earlier entries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Collision] In the loop at lines 70-82 creating vesting pool addresses, can multiple employee pools with the same owner/operator/nonce=0 generate identical vesting pool addresses causing fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Hardcoded Nonce] Line 74 hardcodes nonce as 0 in create_vesting_pool_address(), can this cause all employee vesting pools to collide if they share owner/operator addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Empty Seed] Line 75 passes empty seed &[] to create_vesting_pool_address(), reducing address entropy - can this make vesting pool addresses predictable or vulnerable to precomputation attacks? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Integer Overflow] Although nonce is hardcoded to 0 at line 74, if this value came from external input, could integer overflow in create_vesting_pool_address() cause address wraparound or collision? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/tools.rs] [Function: execute()] [Cross-Pool Collision] Can a malicious validator configure their owner/operator addresses to match an employee pool's addresses, causing their default_stake_pool_address() to collide with a create_vesting_pool_address()?
