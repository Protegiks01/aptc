  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide extremely large values for t or n (near usize::MAX) that could cause integer overflow when BatchEvaluationDomain::new(n) computes the smallest power of 2, potentially leading to incorrect domain initialization and cryptographic failures in PVSS? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Threshold Bypass] Can an attacker set t=n (threshold equals total players) to create a degenerate configuration where all players are required for reconstruction, effectively creating a single point of failure in DKG that could halt validator operations if any single validator goes offline? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation Bypass] Does the validation at line 118 properly handle the edge case where t=n, or could this allow creation of non-Byzantine-fault-tolerant configurations that violate Aptos's <1/3 Byzantine tolerance assumptions, enabling consensus attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Domain Initialization Attack] Can BatchEvaluationDomain::new(n) at line 124 fail silently or return invalid domains for certain values of n (e.g., extremely large n requiring roots of unity beyond BLS12-381 scalar field capacity), allowing creation of ThresholdConfigBlstrs with corrupted cryptographic parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call new() concurrently with the same parameters, could race conditions in EvaluationDomain initialization lead to different validators having inconsistent domain parameters, causing DKG reconstruction failures and validator set corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero-Threshold Attack] Although line 110-111 checks t>0, can an attacker exploit integer underflow or type confusion elsewhere to bypass this check and create a t=0 configuration, allowing secret reconstruction with zero shares and complete DKG security breakdown? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide enormous values for n (e.g., billions) that pass validation but cause BatchEvaluationDomain::new() to allocate massive amounts of memory (storing all N-th roots of unity), leading to validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Inconsistent State] If get_subdomain(n) at line 125 returns a domain with properties inconsistent with the batch_dom created at line 124, could this mismatch cause FFT computations to produce incorrect polynomial evaluations, breaking PVSS security guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Off-by-One Error] The validation t<=n at lines 118-122 allows t=n, but does the PVSS protocol implementation correctly handle this edge case, or could it lead to division-by-zero errors in Lagrange interpolation when computing coefficients for n-of-n reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Type Confusion] Can integer type confusion between usize, u64, and Scalar field elements during domain creation cause t or n to be misinterpreted with different bit widths, leading to threshold mismatches between dealing and reconstruction phases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft malicious serialized data with extremely large t and n values that pass deserialization but cause new() at line 52 to create invalid configurations, bypassing validation logic present in normal construction paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [State Inconsistency] The skipped fields dom and batch_dom are rebuilt via new() at line 52, but can inconsistencies arise if the serialized t,n values don't match the original domain parameters, causing validators to have different cryptographic contexts for the same configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Panic Attack] If new() at line 52 returns an error during deserialization, does the map_err properly propagate this, or could unwrap/expect elsewhere cause validator panics when loading DKG configurations from persistent storage, halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Domain Reconstruction Attack] Since dom and batch_dom are marked #[serde(skip)] at lines 29 and 33, can an attacker exploit timing differences in domain reconstruction to distinguish between different validator states, potentially enabling timing side-channel attacks on DKG operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Integer Truncation] During deserialization of SerializedFields at line 49, if the source data contains integers larger than usize can represent on the target architecture, could truncation occur silently, causing t and n to be different from their serialized values and breaking DKG reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Cross-Architecture Attack] If a ThresholdConfigBlstrs is serialized on a 64-bit system with large n values and deserialized on a 32-bit system where usize is smaller, could this cause deserialization failures or silent truncation, enabling cross-platform attacks on validator configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Memory Amplification] Can an attacker provide serialized data with small t,n values that expand massively during domain reconstruction in new(), causing memory exhaustion attacks when validators load DKG configurations at epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Error Propagation Failure] Does map_err at line 52 properly convert all possible anyhow::Error types from new() into serde errors, or could certain error conditions be lost, causing validators to accept invalid configurations silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_player()] [Predictable RNG Attack] Although marked 'for testing only', if get_random_player() is accidentally used in production DKG, can an attacker predict the player IDs generated by exploiting weak RNG state, enabling targeted attacks on specific validators during key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_player()] [Player ID Bounds] Does gen_range(0, self.n) at line 81 handle the case where n=1 correctly, or could it cause RNG panics or return invalid player IDs when the configuration has only a single player? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_player()] [Modular Bias Attack] The gen_range(0, self.n) implementation may introduce modular bias if n doesn't divide evenly into the RNG output space - could this bias allow an attacker to predict which validators are more likely to be selected, compromising DKG randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_player()] [Test/Production Confusion] Despite the comment 'for testing only' at line 75, are there any code paths where this function could be called in production (e.g., through trait methods), potentially introducing weak randomness into live DKG operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_player()] [Integer Overflow in RNG] If self.n is usize::MAX or near it, could gen_range(0, self.n) overflow internally or wrap around, causing invalid player IDs to be generated that bypass security checks elsewhere in the DKG protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Subset Size Attack] The function calls choose_multiple(self.t) at line 91 to select exactly t players - can an attacker exploit edge cases where t=n to cause the function to return all players, potentially enabling test code to leak production validator sets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Sampling Bias] Does choose_multiple provide cryptographically uniform sampling, or could bias in the selection algorithm allow an attacker to predict which subset of validators will be chosen, compromising DKG security if this function is misused in production?
