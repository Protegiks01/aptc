  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: parse_lockup_expiration()] [Type confusion] The function expects a string containing u64 - can an attacker return JSON numbers instead of strings, causing parsing to fail and default to 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Error] [Error code collision] Line 36 defines error codes as u32 - are error codes globally unique and standardized, or can different error conditions map to the same code, causing incorrect error handling by exchanges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Error] [Retry logic exploitation] Line 40 has a 'retriable' boolean - can an attacker trigger errors that are incorrectly marked as retriable, causing infinite retry loops that amplify DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Error] [Error details information leak] Lines 42-43 include optional error details - can stack traces or internal error messages in 'details' field leak sensitive information about validator configuration, database schema, or private keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: ErrorDetails] [Unbounded error details] Line 50 has a 'details: String' field with no length limit - can an attacker trigger errors that include megabytes of detail data, causing memory exhaustion or API response size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Error] [Message consistency] Line 38 states message 'always matches the error code' - is this enforced programmatically, or can inconsistent error states be constructed where code and message don't match? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Serialization] [Skip serializing None security] Line 42 uses skip_serializing_if for Option fields - can this cause exchanges to misinterpret missing fields as default values, leading to incorrect error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Serialization] [JSON injection] All structs derive Serialize/Deserialize - are string fields properly escaped to prevent JSON injection attacks that could manipulate API responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Deserialization] [Unsafe deserialization] The file uses serde without validation - can attackers send malformed JSON that deserializes to invalid internal states, bypassing business logic checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Version] [Version spoofing] Lines 89-94 define version strings - can an attacker manipulate these version fields to make incompatible clients appear compatible, causing transaction failures or state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Version] [Downgrade attack] Can an attacker report outdated node_version or middleware_version to trigger compatibility modes with known vulnerabilities in older versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: BalanceResult] [Optional balance semantics] Line 100 has 'balance: Option<Amount>' - does None indicate 0 balance or query failure, and can confusion between these states cause incorrect accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: BalanceResult] [Lockup expiration manipulation] Line 102 lockup_expiration is u64 - can overflow or manipulation of this timestamp be used to bypass withdrawal restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: SyncStatus] [Sync status manipulation] Lines 75-81 define sync status fields - can an attacker report false sync status to make other nodes believe the chain is synced when it's not, causing them to accept invalid blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: SyncStatus] [Index overflow] Lines 76-78 use Option<u64> for current/target index - can overflow or inconsistency between current and target cause incorrect sync percentage calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Test: test_parse_requested_balance] [Insufficient edge case testing] Lines 484-548 test parse_requested_balance but don't test overflow scenarios - are edge cases like u64::MAX values, empty arrays, or malformed JSON tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Test: test_parse_lockup_expiration] [Limited test coverage] Lines 550-554 only test successful parsing - are error cases, empty arrays, invalid strings, and overflow values tested? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: get_stake_balances()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] The function checks operator address at line 312 but uses pool data retrieved earlier - can the operator change between checks, bypassing authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: get_stake_balances()] [String conversion] Line 350 and others convert u64 to string via to_string() - can locale settings or formatting differences cause non-canonical representations that fail to parse later? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Constant: STAKE_POOL] [Hardcoded address] Line 294 uses hardcoded '0x1::stake::StakePool' - can upgrades to the stake module at a different address cause this code to query stale or non-existent resources? (High)",
