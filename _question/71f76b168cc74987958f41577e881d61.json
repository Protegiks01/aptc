  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorConfig::fullnode_network_addresses()] [Inconsistent Empty Check] Why does line 984 check validator_network_addresses instead of fullnode_network_addresses - does this cause fullnode addresses to be returned even when they should be empty? (High)",
