  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Byzantine Resistance] [Fake Epoch] Can a Byzantine node run a modified StorageReader that always returns epoch 999999 to make itself appear more synced than honest nodes, disrupting peer selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Byzantine Resistance] [Version Manipulation] Can attackers forge high version numbers in their local storage and serve them through peer monitoring, causing honest nodes to incorrectly trust Byzantine peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Byzantine Resistance] [Timestamp Lying] Can Byzantine validators serve fake timestamps through get_ledger_timestamp_usecs() to manipulate peer latency calculations and avoid being flagged as slow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Network Attack] [Sybil with Storage] Can an attacker create many StorageReader instances pointing to the same forged storage to amplify their influence in peer monitoring reputation systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [State Transitions] [Epoch Reconfiguration] During epoch transitions, can get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() return epoch N+1 with the last version from epoch N, causing peer monitoring to incorrectly assess validator set changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [State Transitions] [Rollback Protection] If a node experiences chain rollback (e.g., after network partition), can the storage functions return decreasing values that violate monotonicity assumptions in peer monitoring? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [State Transitions] [Fast Forward Sync] During fast-forward sync, can get_lowest_available_version() jump significantly while get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() lags, causing confusion about node sync state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Integer Safety] [Tuple Arithmetic] Can subtracting lowest_available_version from highest_synced_version overflow if lowest > highest due to storage corruption, causing panic in monitoring calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Integer Safety] [Epoch Math] If peer monitoring calculates epoch differences, can epoch wraparound at u64::MAX cause incorrect calculations that treat new epochs as ancient? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Integer Safety] [Timestamp Arithmetic] Can timestamp_usecs overflow when calculating time differences, causing peer monitoring to think nodes are synchronized when they're actually hours apart? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Storage Backend] [DbReader Assumptions] Does the code assume DbReader always returns valid data, or can corrupted storage cause LedgerInfo with impossible values (e.g., epoch > version)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Storage Backend] [Async Safety] If the underlying DbReader uses async I/O, can blocking on storage reads cause the peer monitoring server to stall during slow disk operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Storage Backend] [Transaction Isolation] Does the storage layer provide snapshot isolation, or can readers see uncommitted writes that violate blockchain invariants during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Storage Backend] [Backup/Restore] If a node restores from backup, can stale cached StorageReader instances return pre-backup data while new instances return post-backup data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [DoS] [Repeated Queries] Can attackers trigger expensive get_latest_ledger_info() calls in a tight loop by sending peer monitoring requests, causing CPU/disk I/O exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [DoS] [Memory Exhaustion] Can repeated cloning of LedgerInfo (line 40) cause memory exhaustion if LedgerInfo contains large epoch state with thousands of validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [DoS] [Lock Contention] If the underlying DbReader uses locks, can concurrent peer monitoring queries create lock contention that slows down consensus or execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Type Safety] [Version Consistency] Can the version from get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() be less than get_lowest_available_version(), violating the invariant that highest >= lowest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Type Safety] [Epoch Consistency] Can the epoch value be inconsistent with the version (e.g., epoch 5 with version from epoch 3) if ledger commits race with reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Type Safety] [Timestamp Monotonicity] Can get_ledger_timestamp_usecs() return non-monotonic timestamps on sequential calls, breaking assumptions about time progression in peer monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Access Control] [Unrestricted Access] Does StorageReader::new() restrict who can create instances, or can any component create readers that bypass access controls on sensitive ledger data? (Medium)",
