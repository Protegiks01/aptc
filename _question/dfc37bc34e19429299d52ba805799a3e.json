  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Resource limits] [Stack overflow] Can deeply nested or recursive BlockInfo structures cause stack overflow when VoteData.verify() or hash() is called? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Protocol attack] [Equivocation] Does VoteData structure prevent a Byzantine validator from creating two different VoteData for the same round that both pass verify(), enabling double-voting attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Protocol attack] [Chain split] Can malicious VoteData cause honest validators to vote on conflicting chains, leading to permanent network partition requiring a hard fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Protocol attack] [Liveness denial] Can Byzantine validators flood the network with invalid VoteData that passes initial checks but fails verify(), consuming honest validators' CPU and preventing consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Protocol attack] [Quorum manipulation] Can carefully crafted VoteData manipulate the vote aggregation logic to achieve quorum with less than the required 2f+1 stake, breaking Byzantine fault tolerance? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Protocol attack] [Timestamp manipulation] Can coordinated Byzantine validators all use timestamp manipulation in their VoteData to force the network into a false timeout state, halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Edge case] [Genesis block] How does VoteData.verify() handle the genesis block where parent might not exist or have special zero values, and can this be exploited to inject fake genesis votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Edge case] [Epoch boundary] At epoch transitions, can VoteData with parent from old epoch and proposed from new epoch pass verify() but violate epoch change protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum round] What happens when round numbers approach MAX_U64, and can VoteData.verify() handle the wraparound or will it cause consensus to halt? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Edge case] [Zero timestamps] Can VoteData with zero timestamps for both parent and proposed be exploited to bypass time-based security mechanisms in the consensus protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Edge case] [Empty BlockInfo] Does verify() properly reject VoteData created with BlockInfo::empty() except for the genesis case, or can empty blocks be injected into consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [DoS] [Verify() spam] Can an attacker send VoteData that is expensive to verify() (e.g., triggers worst-case complexity in validation checks) to degrade validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [DoS] [Hash computation DoS] Can malicious VoteData with specially crafted BlockInfo cause hash computation to take excessive time, slowing down vote processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [DoS] [Deserialization DoS] Can adversarial serialized VoteData cause deserialization to consume excessive CPU or memory, affecting validator availability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [DoS] [Clone bombing] Can an attacker trigger excessive cloning of VoteData to exhaust memory, especially if VoteData contains large BlockInfo structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Crypto] [Hash preimage] Can an attacker find preimages for VoteData hashes to create fraudulent votes that appear to have been signed by honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Crypto] [Signature malleability] If VoteData hash is malleable (can be modified while keeping signature valid), can this be exploited to cause vote equivocation or double-counting? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Crypto] [Randomness] Does VoteData construction use any randomness, and if so, can weak or predictable randomness be exploited to forge votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Data integrity] [Parent-child consistency] Does verify() ensure that parent and proposed BlockInfo actually represent a valid parent-child relationship (e.g., parent.id is referenced in proposed), or only checks independent fields? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Data integrity] [Executed state consistency] Can VoteData have parent and proposed BlockInfo with inconsistent executed_state_id values that would indicate invalid state transitions but still pass verify()? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Data integrity] [Version-timestamp correlation] Should verify() check that version increases correlate with timestamp increases (more transactions = later time), and can the lack of this check be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Testing gap] [Mutation testing] Has verify() been tested with all possible combinations of valid/invalid epoch, round, timestamp, and version values to ensure complete coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Testing gap] [Fuzzing] Has VoteData deserialization been fuzzed with malformed inputs to detect crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Testing gap] [Property testing] Have property-based tests verified that verify() correctly implements all AptosBFT safety and liveness properties? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_data.rs] [Upgrade] [Protocol version] If VoteData format changes in a future protocol version, can old validators and new validators produce incompatible VoteData that causes network partition? (Critical)"
