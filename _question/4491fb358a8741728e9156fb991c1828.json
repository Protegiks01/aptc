  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Function: new()] [Factory Pattern] Should new() be the only way to create Tracked instances, or can direct enum construction bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Struct: StateStorageUsage] [Protocol Upgrade] Can protocol upgrades change StateStorageUsage semantics, causing old serialized values to be misinterpreted after upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Enum: StateStorageUsage] [Variant Addition] If new enum variants are added in future versions, will old validators reject new blocks containing them, causing hard forks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Version Skew] Can validators running different versions serialize StateStorageUsage differently, causing consensus failures during rolling upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Function: add_item()] [Specification Gap] Is it specified whether bytes_delta should include only data bytes or also metadata/overhead bytes, and can inconsistent interpretation cause consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Function: remove_item()] [Specification Gap] Is it specified whether bytes_delta should exactly match the value used in the corresponding add_item() call, or can mismatches accumulate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_storage_usage.rs] [Enum: StateStorageUsage] [Untracked Semantics] Is it clearly specified when Untracked should be used versus Tracked, and can ambiguity lead to inconsistent usage across the codebase? (Low)"
