  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Limit bypass] Can an attacker provide u64::MAX as the limit parameter to cause integer overflow in take(limit as usize), potentially exhausting memory or causing panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Sequence number continuity] The function checks seq != cur_seq and returns DB corruption error, but can attackers trigger false positives by racing between pruning and query execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Ledger version enforcement] The check ver > ledger_version breaks the loop, but does this properly handle the case where events exist at exactly ledger_version that should be included? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Iterator seek safety] Does seek(&(*event_key, start_seq_num)) properly validate start_seq_num, or can u64::MAX cause undefined iterator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Path comparison] The check 'path != *event_key' breaks iteration - can attackers exploit event key collision or hash collision to access events from different streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Arithmetic overflow] The line 'cur_seq += 1' is inside an allow(clippy::arithmetic_side_effects) block - can this overflow when processing the last possible sequence number? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Error message ambiguity] The error distinguishes 'First requested event is probably pruned' vs 'DB corruption', but can attackers trigger the corruption error maliciously to create false alarms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Version validation] Does the function verify that returned versions are in ascending order, or can database corruption cause backwards version sequences that break determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Result vector growth] With large limit values, can the result vector growth cause memory exhaustion before the limit is checked, leading to OOM DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_events_by_key()] [Partial results] If the function breaks due to ver > ledger_version mid-iteration, does the partial result set maintain consistency or can it return incomplete event sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_by_key()] [Single element assumption] The function calls lookup_events_by_key with limit=1 then accesses indices[0] - is there any validation that indices is non-empty before indexing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_by_key()] [Array bounds] Accessing indices[0] without checking length could panic if lookup_events_by_key returns empty due to pruning race conditions - is this handled safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_by_key()] [Error format inconsistency] The NotFound error uses different format than get_event_by_version_and_index - can this inconsistency be exploited to fingerprint internal code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_by_key()] [Return value validation] Does the function verify that the returned (version, index) pair is valid before returning, or can corrupted database state return invalid coordinates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_before_or_at_version()] [Iterator boundary] Does seek_for_prev with u64::MAX for sequence number safely handle the maximum value edge case without overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_before_or_at_version()] [Version precision] Can an attacker exploit off-by-one errors by providing version values at transaction boundaries to access events that shouldn't be visible yet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_before_or_at_version()] [Key validation] After calling next(), the function checks key == *event_key - can hash collisions or database corruption cause false matches with wrong event streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_before_or_at_version()] [None handling] When returning None, is the semantic difference between 'no events exist' vs 'all events are after version' properly communicated to callers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_before_or_at_version()] [Version zero] If version is 0, does seek_for_prev handle this edge case correctly or could it underflow accessing negative/invalid positions? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_at_or_after_version()] [Version boundary] Does seek with sequence 0 properly handle version boundaries, or can it skip events that occur at the exact version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: lookup_event_at_or_after_version()] [Iterator direction] The seek starts with seq=0 then calls next() - can this miss events with higher sequence numbers at the exact version? (Medium)",
