  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Stack overflow] If module nesting or constant processing involves deep recursion, could a malicious Move project with deeply nested structures cause stack overflow during error map generation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Panic] The gen() method calls build_error_map().unwrap() which will panic if any error occurs - can an attacker craft invalid Move code that triggers this panic during build, creating a DoS against the build pipeline? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Error propagation] Does build_error_map() properly propagate all errors from build_error_categories() and build_error_map_for_module(), or could some errors be silently ignored while others cause unwrap panics? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Panic] Does ErrorMapping::to_file() have any panic paths (e.g., file I/O errors, serialization failures), and if so, could these leave the build in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapOptions] [Empty prefix] Can error_prefix be set to an empty string, causing all constants to match the starts_with() check and creating a massive error map with non-error constants? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapOptions] [Long prefix] Can error_prefix be set to an extremely long string (megabytes) causing performance degradation or memory issues in the starts_with() comparison for every constant? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapOptions] [Special characters] Can error_prefix contain regex special characters or Unicode that could cause unexpected matching behavior in starts_with()? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapOptions] [Module name validation] If error_category_module is set to an invalid or malicious module name, are there validation checks, or could this cause crashes when attempting to match against it? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: Default::default()] [Default values] Does the default 'E' prefix conflict with common Move constant naming conventions, potentially causing false positives where non-error constants are treated as errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapGen] [Mutable state] The ErrmapGen struct holds mutable output: ErrorMapping - if multiple threads call gen() concurrently, could this cause data races or corrupted error maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Iterator safety] Does get_modules() return an iterator that could be invalidated if GlobalEnv is modified during iteration, causing use-after-free or iterator invalidation bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Shared references] Are the &ModuleEnv references valid for the entire duration of processing, or could the module be unloaded/modified by another thread causing dangling references? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Non-deterministic iteration] Does get_modules() iterate modules in a deterministic order (e.g., sorted by name/address), or could iteration order vary between builds causing non-reproducible error maps? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Non-deterministic constants] Does get_named_constants() return constants in a deterministic order, or could the order affect error map generation and break build reproducibility? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Serialization order] Does ErrorMapping::to_file() serialize error codes in a deterministic order (sorted keys), or could HashMap iteration order cause non-deterministic file output? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Missing validation] Does build_error_categories() validate that error category codes are within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-255), or could arbitrarily large category codes be accepted? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Namespace pollution] If the error module defines constants that don't start with the error_prefix, are they correctly excluded from error categories, or could they pollute the category namespace? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Logic error] Is the logic 'if module is error module then build categories else build module errors' mutually exclusive, or could a malicious module trigger both paths and create inconsistent error map state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: name_string()] [Invalid symbol] Can get_name() return an invalid Symbol that causes symbol_pool().string() to panic or return None, crashing the build process? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: name_string()] [String lifetime] Does the Rc<String> returned by symbol_pool().string() have sufficient lifetime, or could the underlying string be deallocated while still referenced in ErrorDescription? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [String comparison] Is the starts_with() comparison for error_prefix locale-aware, or could different Unicode normalization forms cause false negatives? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Script exclusion] Why are script modules excluded via !is_script_module() - could this filtering logic be bypassed to include script modules and cause unexpected error map entries? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Module type confusion] Can an attacker mark a malicious module as a script module to exclude it from error map generation, hiding error codes that should be documented? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Empty iteration] If get_modules() returns an empty iterator (no modules), does gen() complete successfully or could this indicate a GlobalEnv initialization failure that should be caught? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Empty description] Can error constants have empty documentation strings (get_doc() returns ''), and if so, does this create useless error map entries? (Low)"
