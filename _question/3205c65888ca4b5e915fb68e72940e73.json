  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Memory: Clone overhead] [Excessive copying] Can repeated Clone operations on large crypto material structures cause performance degradation or memory pressure during signature verification? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Integration: Transaction signing] [Sequence number bypass] Can signature traits be exploited to reuse signatures across transactions with different sequence numbers, bypassing replay protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Integration: Validator authentication] [Validator impersonation] Can attackers exploit gaps in signature verification to impersonate validators and submit invalid blocks to consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Integration: Multi-signature schemes] [Quorum bypass] Can multi-signature implementations be exploited to reduce the required threshold, allowing fewer signers than required to authorize transactions? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Testing: Feature gates] [Test code in production] Are test-only functions like sign_arbitrary_message() properly gated behind feature flags, or can they be accessed in production builds? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Verification: Empty batch] [Batch verification with zero signatures] Does batch_verify() correctly handle empty Vec inputs, or does it incorrectly return Ok() for zero signatures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Verification: Duplicate entries] [Duplicate key-signature pairs] Can batch_verify() be exploited by including the same valid signature multiple times to pass verification with fewer unique valid signatures?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/traits.rs] [Verification: Mixed algorithms] [Algorithm confusion] Can batch_verify() handle mixed signature algorithms correctly, or can attackers mix Ed25519 and MultiEd25519 signatures to bypass verification? (High)",
