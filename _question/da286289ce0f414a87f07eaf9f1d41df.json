  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory allocation attack] Can an attacker exploit jemalloc configuration on Unix systems to cause memory exhaustion or corruption through specially crafted CLI commands that trigger excessive allocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency confusion] In move_tool::register_package_hooks() call, can malicious package dependencies be registered that override legitimate Aptos framework packages during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Runtime configuration] Does the tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread() use secure defaults, or can thread pool exhaustion lead to denial of service when processing malicious Move packages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] If Tool::parse() encounters malformed command-line arguments, can it cause a panic that bypasses proper cleanup, potentially leaving sensitive data in memory? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Race condition] Is there a race condition between runtime.block_on() completing and runtime.shutdown_timeout() being called that could leave async tasks in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
