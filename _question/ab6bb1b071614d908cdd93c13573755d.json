  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_transaction_summaries()] [Version Range Manipulation] Can providing start_version > end_version at lines 200-203 cause integer underflow when calculating the iterator range, accessing unauthorized data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_transaction_summaries()] [Reverse Iterator Logic] At lines 222-227, when start_version is None, results are reversed - can this reversal operation be exploited with specially crafted limits to return transactions out of the requested range? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_transaction_summaries()] [Pruning Gap] Does the function check if versions between start_version and end_version have been pruned, or can it return incomplete summaries with gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_hash()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker create a transaction with a hash collision that maps to a different transaction's version, allowing them to retrieve proofs for transactions they didn't create? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_hash()] [Best Effort Abuse] The comment at line 231 states 'best-effort' and 'CANNOT provide absence proof' - can this be exploited to claim non-existent transactions exist or vice versa in fraud proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_hash()] [Version Mismatch] Can get_transaction_version_by_hash return a version greater than ledger_version, and does line 242 properly handle this case? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_version()] [Direct Delegation Risk] Since this directly delegates to get_transaction_with_proof, are all error cases from that function properly propagated, or can some errors be silently swallowed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_by_version()] [Version Validation] Does the function validate that version <= ledger_version before delegating, or does it rely entirely on get_transaction_with_proof for this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Integer Overflow] At line 282, 'limit = std::cmp::min(limit, ledger_version - start_version + 1)' - can ledger_version - start_version overflow when start_version > ledger_version is false but values are near u64::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Early Return Bypass] At lines 277-279, if start_version > ledger_version, an empty list is returned - can this be exploited to bypass pruning checks by using future versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Batch Inconsistency] Lines 284-311 collect txns, txn_infos, events, and persisted_aux_info in separate loops - can race conditions cause these collections to have different lengths, breaking the TransactionListWithProof invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Event Fetching Logic] At lines 294-302, events are only fetched if fetch_events is true - can an attacker bypass event access controls by setting fetch_events=true when they shouldn't have access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Proof Integrity] The proof at lines 312-317 uses get_transaction_range_proof - can this proof be invalid if transactions are pruned between the start of the function and proof generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Auxiliary Info Default] At line 309, PersistedAuxiliaryInfo::None is used as default - can this mask database corruption where auxiliary info should exist but doesn't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_txn_version()] [Pruner State Race] Can the min_readable_version returned by ledger_pruner.get_min_readable_version() change immediately after being read, causing callers to attempt reading pruned versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_txn_version()] [Always Some Return] This always returns Some(...) - can this create issues where callers expect None for empty databases but receive version 0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_viable_block()] [Event Lookup Failure] At lines 340-348, if lookup_event_at_or_after_version returns None, a NotFound error is returned - can this be exploited to DoS the system by pruning NewBlockEvents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_viable_block()] [Index Skip Logic] When skip_index_and_usage is true (lines 339-353), the function uses a completely different code path - can attackers manipulate this flag to get inconsistent results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_viable_block()] [Height Extraction] Line 352 calls expect_new_block_event() which can panic - does this create a DoS vector if block events are malformed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_first_viable_block()] [Metadata Fallback] Lines 355-358 fall back to metadata_db when skip_index_and_usage is true - can this return a different block height than the event-based approach, creating inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Limit Calculation] Similar to get_transactions(), line 389 calculates limit with potential overflow - can this be exploited with versions near u64::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Multiunzip Safety] At line 422, multiunzip() is used to separate the collected tuple - can the sizes of txn_infos, txns_and_outputs, and persisted_aux_info become mismatched due to partial failures in the collect()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Write Set Retrieval] Line 399 gets write_set which may contain sensitive state changes - are there access controls to prevent unauthorized read of write sets for system transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Auxiliary Data Default] Line 405 uses unwrap_or_default() for transaction_auxiliary_data - can this hide missing data that indicates database corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Gas Used Consistency] Line 409 uses txn_info.gas_used() - can this be inconsistent with the actual gas in the TransactionOutput if txn_info is from a different version due to race conditions?
