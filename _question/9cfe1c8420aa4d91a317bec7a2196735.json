  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Signer Creation] patch_aptos_governance() injects create_signer native function - can this allow unauthorized signer creation for arbitrary addresses beyond the governance context? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Bytecode Injection] Does patch_aptos_governance() properly validate the injected bytecode sequence (ImmBorrowLoc, VecLen, LdU64, etc.), or can malformed bytecode cause VM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Type Safety] The patched function signature expects address and returns signer - can type mismatches in the injected bytecode cause memory corruption or type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Magic Number Abuse] The magic number MAGIC_FAILED_NEXT_EXECUTION_HASH_CHECK (0xDEADBEEF) - can legitimate errors with this abort code be misinterpreted as next_execution_hash violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Vector Length Check] The forbid_next_execution_hash check uses VecLen - can integer overflow in vector length calculations bypass this validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Branch Target] The BrTrue(7) instruction jumps over abort code - can incorrect bytecode offsets cause execution of unintended instructions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Acquires Clearing] The patch clears acquires_global_resources - does this bypass resource safety checks that should prevent concurrent access violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Call Target Validation] Does the Call(create_signer_handle_idx) validate that the handle points to a native function, or can it call arbitrary functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Return Stack Mismatch] Can the Ret instruction cause stack underflow or overflow if the injected bytecode doesn't properly manage the operand stack? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Signature Index] Does get_or_add_signature(m, vec![SignatureToken::U8]) properly validate the returned index fits in the bytecode instruction operands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [Hash Collision] Can add_script_execution_hash() be exploited through hash collisions, allowing malicious scripts to execute with approved hash privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [Duplicate Detection] Does add_script_execution_hash() properly check if an entry already exists before adding, or can duplicate entries cause confusion in hash validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [Dummy Proposal ID] The use of DUMMY_PROPOSAL_ID (u64::MAX) - can this conflict with legitimate proposal IDs, causing authorization confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [Hash Verification] Does modify_on_chain_config properly validate hash formats, or can malformed hashes corrupt the ApprovedExecutionHashes storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: add_script_execution_hash()] [State Consistency] If add_script_execution_hash() fails midway, can partially applied changes leave ApprovedExecutionHashes in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [State Transition] Does force_end_epoch() properly validate state transitions, or can forcing epochs at arbitrary times cause validator set inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [Signer Injection] force_end_epoch() uses AptosEnvironment::new_with_injected_create_signer_for_gov_sim - can this injected signer bypass security checks in epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [Gas Metering] force_end_epoch() uses UnmeteredGasMeter - can this allow resource exhaustion attacks that wouldn't be caught by normal gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [Visibility Bypass] The function uses execute_function_bypass_visibility - can this execute privileged operations that should be restricted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: force_end_epoch()] [Change Set Materialization] Can try_materialize_aggregator_v1_delta_set fail in ways that corrupt aggregator state during forced epoch transitions? (High)",
