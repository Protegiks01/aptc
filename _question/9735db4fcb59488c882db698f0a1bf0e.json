  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Function: DBTool::run()] [Error handling bypass] Can an attacker trigger a panic or unhandled error in the match arms that could leave the database in an inconsistent state, potentially corrupting the ledger or causing validator nodes to crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Function: DBTool::run()] [Async race condition] Does the async execution of commands properly synchronize database access, or can concurrent runs of different DBTool commands (e.g., Backup + Restore) cause race conditions leading to state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Function: DBTool::run()] [Result propagation] Are all Result types properly propagated from subcommands, or can certain error conditions be silently ignored, allowing corrupted backups or incomplete restores to appear successful? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Enum: DBTool] [Command injection] Can an attacker manipulate command-line arguments to execute unintended command combinations that bypass security checks or access control mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/lib.rs] [Function: DBTool::run()] [Privilege escalation] Does the tool properly validate that only authorized operators can execute sensitive commands like Bootstrap or Restore that could overwrite critical blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Genesis tampering] Can an attacker provide a malicious genesis_txn_file that when loaded by load_genesis_txn() allows them to inject arbitrary initial state, creating tokens out of thin air or giving themselves validator privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Path traversal] Does the genesis_txn_file path validation prevent directory traversal attacks, or can an attacker read arbitrary files from the filesystem using paths like '../../../../etc/passwd'? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Waypoint bypass] Can the waypoint_to_verify check be bypassed by providing None or manipulating the commit flag, allowing unverified genesis states to be committed to the production database? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [DB exclusive lock] Is the AptosDB::open() exclusive lock properly enforced, or can multiple bootstrap processes run concurrently causing write conflicts and database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [State verification] Does the ledger_summary.next_version() check properly validate against waypoint.version(), or can there be off-by-one errors allowing incorrect genesis states to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [Deserialization exploit] Can malformed BCS-encoded data in the genesis transaction file cause memory corruption or panic during bcs::from_bytes() deserialization, leading to DoS or RCE? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Double commit] If commit is called multiple times or interrupted, can it create duplicate genesis blocks or inconsistent state in the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: calculate_genesis()] [Determinism violation] Does calculate_genesis produce identical waypoints across all nodes, or can validator-specific state cause non-deterministic genesis execution leading to network splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Transaction type validation] Is the assert for GenesisTransaction sufficient, or can other transaction types be smuggled through if the assertion is disabled in release builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Pruner config bypass] Does NO_OP_STORAGE_PRUNER_CONFIG properly disable pruning during bootstrap, or can concurrent pruning operations corrupt the genesis state being written? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Backup tampering] Can an attacker intercept and modify backup data in transit to the storage backend, injecting malicious state that could be restored later to compromise validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Storage authentication bypass] Does DBToolStorageOpt.init_storage() properly authenticate to cloud storage backends, or can unauthorized users create/modify backups in production storage locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Enum: BackupType] [Race condition] Can concurrent EpochEnding, StateSnapshot, and Transaction backups running simultaneously cause inconsistent snapshots where state versions don't align with transaction versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: OneoffBackupOpt execution] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate start/end version parameters to create partial backups that skip critical transactions, enabling selective history rewriting during restore? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Client impersonation] Can BackupServiceClient be instantiated with malicious client options pointing to a fake backup service, causing backup data to be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: CoordinatorRunOpt] [Continuous backup DoS] Can the continuous backup coordinator be exploited to consume excessive resources (CPU/memory/bandwidth) causing validator performance degradation or consensus failures? (Medium)",
