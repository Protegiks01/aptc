(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Lines: 194-201] [Randomness MSM] The randomness R_j computation only uses pp.H and r_j - is this sufficient, or can an attacker forge randomness values that pass verification but break decryption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Empty input] What happens if the witness has empty plaintext_chunks or plaintext_randomness? Can this bypass encryption or cause invalid ciphertexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: Homomorphism::msm_eval()] [Unchecked MSM failure] The MSM computation uses expect() to unwrap - if MSM fails due to invalid points or scalars, can this be exploited to DoS the DKG protocol by causing panics during dealing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Lines: 209-211] [MSM security] The VariableBaseMSM trait is used without additional validation - can an attacker exploit implementation bugs in the MSM algorithm to compute incorrect ciphertexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: msm_eval()] [Length mismatch] Are bases and scalars arrays always the same length? Can mismatched lengths cause the MSM to use wrong values or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: msm_eval()] [Scalar validity] Are scalars validated to be in the correct field before MSM? Can out-of-range scalars cause incorrect ciphertext computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: Homomorphism::apply()] [Composition safety] The apply() function composes msm_terms() and apply_msm() - can errors in either stage go undetected, producing invalid ciphertexts that pass verification? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: correlated_randomness()] [Correlation break] The function generates correlated randomness where r_0 is computed from other r_i values - can an attacker break this correlation to forge ciphertexts that decrypt incorrectly or leak information?
