  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_status.rs] [Attack: Incarnation Counter Overflow] Can an attacker trigger enough aborts to overflow the incarnation counter from u32::MAX to 0, causing execution history to be reset and breaking determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_status.rs] [Attack: Lock Contention DoS] Can an attacker craft transactions that cause high lock contention on status_with_incarnation Mutexes, degrading parallel execution performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_status.rs] [Attack: Status Shortcut Desync] Can an attacker exploit the gap between status updates (under lock) and shortcut updates (Relaxed atomic) to cause inconsistent state across workers? (High)"
