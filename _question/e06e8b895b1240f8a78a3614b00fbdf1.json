  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalars()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a malicious num_scalars value that causes integer overflow in the calculation `2 * num_scalars * byte_size` at line 42, potentially leading to a smaller buffer allocation than expected and causing out-of-bounds writes or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalars()] [Insufficient Entropy] Does the challenge_bytes() call at line 43 provide sufficient entropy when generating multiple scalars, or can an attacker exploit predictable transcript state to forge valid challenges and break the Fiat-Shamir soundness property? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalars()] [Modular Reduction Bias] Can the use of from_le_bytes_mod_order() at line 46 introduce statistical bias in the scalar distribution when the input bytes don't uniformly cover the scalar field, allowing an attacker to predict challenges with higher-than-expected probability and forge proofs?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalars()] [Determinism Violation] Is the scalar generation deterministic across different platforms and implementations, or can floating-point operations or endianness differences lead to different validators generating different challenges from the same transcript? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalars()] [Zero Scalar Generation] Can the modular reduction produce zero scalars with non-negligible probability, and if so, do the calling functions properly handle zero challenges to prevent division-by-zero or trivial proof generation?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_full_scalar()] [Unnecessary Allocation] Does calling challenge_full_scalars(label, 1) and taking only [0] create unnecessary allocations that could be exploited for memory exhaustion attacks during high-frequency challenge generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/fiat_shamir.rs] [Function: challenge_128bit_scalars()] [Reduced Entropy Security] Does using only 128 bits of entropy (16 bytes at line 51) instead of full scalar field size provide sufficient security against birthday attacks and collision-based proof forgery in the DKG protocol?
