(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/table_info_service.rs] [Function: transactions_in_epochs()] [Block info dependency] Lines 634-637 depend on get_block_info_by_version() for epoch information - can stale or manipulated block info cause transactions to be assigned to incorrect epochs permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/table_info_service.rs] [Function: run()] [Epoch initialization] Lines 105 and 639-642 handle current_epoch being None - can the first epoch transition be handled incorrectly if the initial transactions span multiple epochs?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/table_info_service.rs] [Function: run()] [Snapshot atomicity] Lines 125-143 process previous epoch transactions then snapshot - if processing succeeds but snapshot fails at line 142, can this cause loss of epoch boundary information?
