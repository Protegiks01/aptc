  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Cross-function] [Latency Timing Attack] Can attackers use timing attacks to infer when validators will next dial them based on the priority ordering in choose_peers_to_dial_randomly, enabling prediction of network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeer] [Comparison Bug] Does DiscoveredPeer's PartialOrd implementation used in partial_cmp() at line 29 handle all edge cases correctly, or can malformed peer data cause incorrect sorting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeer] [has_dialed_recently()] If the has_dialed_recently() method has a bug in its time calculation, can it incorrectly classify peers, causing the two-phase selection in choose_random_peers_by_ping_latency to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeer] [Clone Safety] Is the DiscoveredPeer Clone implementation safe for concurrent access, or can cloning race with updates to create inconsistent peer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeer] [Latency Validation] Does DiscoveredPeer validate ping_latency_secs when set, or can negative/infinite/NaN values be stored and later passed to convert_latency_to_weight()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeerSet] [get_ping_latency_secs()] Can the get_ping_latency_secs() method return stale or outdated latency data if ping measurements are updated infrequently, causing suboptimal peer selection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeerSet] [Concurrent Modification] When discovered_peers.read() is held, can other threads still modify the underlying peer_set HashMap, violating read lock semantics and causing data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: DiscoveredPeerSet] [Peer Removal] If peers are removed from DiscoveredPeerSet while peer selection is in progress, can this cause get_discovered_peers_for_ids to return fewer peers than the selection algorithm intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: NetworkContext] [is_public_network()] Can the network_id().is_public_network() check be spoofed by modifying NetworkContext, allowing validator networks to incorrectly use latency-based selection and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Integration: NetworkContext] [Logging Leak] Does the NetworkSchema logging at lines 136-141 leak sensitive information about network topology, peer IDs, or internal state that could help attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Error Handling] [Silent Failures] When choose_multiple_weighted returns an error, does the silent fallback to empty vec at line 134-143 hide critical issues that should halt validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Handling] Are there any unwrap() or expect() calls in the selection pipeline that could panic on invalid data, crashing validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Latency] If multiple peers report exactly 0.0 latency (due to local connections or bugs), does convert_latency_to_weight return 0.0 for all of them, making them unselectable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Edge Case] [Single Peer] When only one peer is eligible for selection, do all functions handle this correctly, or can edge cases in shuffle/sort/selection cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Peers] If num_peers_to_dial or num_peers_to_choose is set to usize::MAX, do the functions handle this gracefully or attempt to process/allocate excessive resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Edge Case] [All Peers Recently Dialed] If all eligible peers have been dialed recently, does choose_random_peers_by_ping_latency fall back correctly to selecting from recently-dialed peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Validator Attack] [Consensus Partition] Can attackers manipulate peer selection on validator networks to partition the validator set, preventing quorum and halting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Validator Attack] [Leader Isolation] Can malicious validators use peer selection manipulation to isolate the current consensus leader, preventing them from proposing blocks and causing liveness failures? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Validator Attack] [Proposal Censorship] Can attackers use peer selection to prevent validators from receiving block proposals, causing them to fall behind and potentially fork the chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/selection.rs] [Public Network] [Eclipse Attack on Fullnodes] Can attackers with geographically distributed low-latency peers eclipse public fullnodes, feeding them false blockchain data or censoring transactions? (High)",
