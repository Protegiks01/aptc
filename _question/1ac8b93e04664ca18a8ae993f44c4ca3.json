  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Macro: dealt_secret_key_share_impl] [Import hygiene] The macro uses imports from the parent module - can macro hygiene issues cause the wrong types to be imported when the macro is expanded in different contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Reconstruction vulnerability] When multiple DealtSecretKeyShare instances are combined for secret reconstruction, can an attacker provide shares from different dealing phases to create an invalid reconstructed secret? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Share reuse attack] Can the same DealtSecretKeyShare be used in multiple reconstruction attempts, allowing an attacker to learn information about other players' shares through repeated protocol executions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: new()] [Unvalidated input] The new() constructor accepts any DealtSecretKey without validation - can a malicious player construct shares that pass individual checks but fail when combined during threshold reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Missing player binding] The share doesn't store which player it belongs to - can shares be reassigned to different players during DKG, breaking the threshold security assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization context leak] When shares are serialized for storage or transmission, is there any contextual information (player ID, transcript ID) included that could be manipulated to use shares in wrong contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Missing versioning] The ValidCryptoMaterial implementation doesn't include version information - can old shares be replayed in new DKG rounds with different security parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Threshold bypass] Can an attacker collect fewer than threshold shares and still reconstruct partial information about the secret by exploiting the linear structure of Shamir secret sharing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]>] [Error message information leak] When deserialization fails, does the CryptoMaterialError reveal information about why the bytes were invalid that could help an attacker craft valid-looking malicious shares? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&[u8]>] [Panic on invalid input] Can specially crafted input cause TryFrom to panic instead of returning an error, enabling DoS attacks on validators during DKG? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Null reference attack] Can as_group_element() ever return a null or invalid reference due to uninitialized memory, causing undefined behavior in calling code? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: new()] [Unchecked construction] Since new() doesn't validate its input, can it be used to create shares with invalid internal state that cause downstream protocol failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Struct: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Concurrent access] If DealtSecretKeyShare is shared across threads via Arc, can concurrent calls to as_group_element() and to_bytes() cause data races or inconsistent views of the share? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone race condition] During DKG, if shares are cloned while being used in reconstruction, can a race condition cause the same share to be counted multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization race] Can concurrent serialization of the same share produce different byte sequences due to non-deterministic ordering in the underlying group element representation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_secret_key_share.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Cache timing attack] Does as_group_element() reveal information about the secret share value through cache timing patterns when accessed repeatedly? (Medium)",
