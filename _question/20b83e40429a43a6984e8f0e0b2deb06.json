  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract()] [Non-deterministic output] If different validator nodes use different hash function implementations for D or have floating-point differences in generic_array operations, can this cause non-deterministic key derivation breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [Byzantine PRK manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator provide manipulated PRK values when deriving shared keys, causing honest validators to derive different keys and breaking consensus on cryptographic operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract_then_expand()] [Malicious info injection] Can a Byzantine validator inject malicious info values during shared key derivation ceremonies, causing state divergence across validators and potential network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract()] [Seed distribution attack] During distributed key generation, can Byzantine validators contribute weak or biased seed material that reduces the entropy of the combined ikm below safe thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [Output verification missing] Does the protocol verify that all validators derived identical output keys from HKDF, or can Byzantine faults cause validators to use mismatched keys breaking signature aggregation or threshold cryptography? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract()] [Seed storage security] If seeds (ikm) are persisted to disk for validator restart scenarios, are they properly encrypted, or can disk access reveal master seeds compromising all derived keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [PRK caching vulnerability] If PRK values are cached in memory or disk to avoid recomputation, can cache poisoning attacks substitute weak PRKs causing predictable key derivation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract_then_expand()] [State rollback attack] During state sync or snapshot restoration, can an attacker force validators to reuse old seeds or PRKs, causing key collision with previously derived keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [Derived key persistence] When derived keys are stored in AptosDB or other storage layers, are they properly protected with encryption-at-rest, or can storage compromise reveal all validator or account keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract()] [Backup contamination] If validator backups include seeds or PRKs, can compromised backup systems enable offline attacks to derive all validator keys without accessing live systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Import: hkdf crate] [Upstream vulnerability] The implementation relies on the external hkdf crate at line 125 - can vulnerabilities in that crate's implementation bypass Aptos's validation or introduce subtle key derivation bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Import: digest crate] [Hash function backdoor] The digest trait at lines 79-82 could be implemented by malicious hash functions - can supply chain attacks introduce backdoored hash implementations that leak key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Import: generic_array] [Type confusion] Can vulnerabilities in generic_array's type-level arithmetic at line 80-83 cause length miscalculations that bypass security checks or enable buffer overflows? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Documentation: line 38] [Salt weakness guidance] The documentation states salt can be 'shorter or less random' - can developers misinterpret this as allowing attacker-controlled or zero-length salt, compromising security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Documentation: line 54] [Extract-only misuse] The warning at line 54 about using both steps - can developers incorrectly use only extract() or expand() in isolation, breaking HKDF's security guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Documentation: line 69] [Example seed size] The example uses a 32-byte seed at line 70 but minimum is 16 bytes at line 94 - can developers use 16-byte seeds thinking they're equivalent, providing insufficient security for long-term keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract_then_expand_no_ikm()] [CAUTION label insufficiency] The CAUTION at line 158 warns about non-compliance but doesn't explain the security implications - can developers use this function inappropriately in contexts requiring high security? (Medium)",
