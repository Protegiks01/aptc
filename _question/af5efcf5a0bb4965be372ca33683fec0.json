  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_blocks()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to process_incoming_blocks() cause shares to be broadcast multiple times or block queue corruption if the same block metadata is processed simultaneously from different threads? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Cryptographic bypass] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate the FullRandMetadata to cause S::generate() to produce predictable shares, allowing them to bias the final randomness output? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [State inconsistency] If rand_store.add_share() fails after broadcasting self_share to the network, can this create a state where other validators have shares that the local node doesn't, causing aggregation failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Timing attack] The task sleeps for 300ms before requesting shares - can a Byzantine validator exploit this fixed delay to collect enough shares early and predict randomness before honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [DoS attack] Can a Byzantine validator cause resource exhaustion by triggering thousands of share request broadcasts for non-existent or invalid rounds, as there's no rate limiting on multicast operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Equivocation] Does the synchronous add_aug_data() call truly prevent race conditions where a validator broadcasts different aug_data to different peers before persisting locally? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Liveness failure] If get_my_certified_aug_data() returns Some but the data is corrupted or invalid, will the broadcast phase be skipped causing the validator to never participate in randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Authorization bypass] The incoming_blocks stream is only processed when my_certified_aug_data_exists() returns true - can a Byzantine peer cause this check to fail by manipulating certified data, effectively censoring randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Message verification bypass] Does the verification_task properly handle malformed BCS-encoded messages that could crash the deserializer or bypass signature checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the incoming_rpc_request channel with invalid messages to exhaust the bounded_executor's thread pool, preventing legitimate share processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Double processing] In the RandMessage::RequestShare handler, if get_self_share() returns None and generates a new share, is there a race where multiple requests could cause multiple shares to be generated for the same metadata? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Epoch confusion] When processing RandMessage::Share, are epoch and round boundaries properly validated to prevent shares from one epoch being mixed with another, potentially breaking threshold cryptography? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Fast path bypass] Can a Byzantine validator send only FastShare messages without corresponding regular Shares to manipulate the fast path aggregation while breaking the slow path? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Error handling] The AugData handler silently warns for equivocation errors but errors for others - can attackers use this to distinguish between detection scenarios and adjust their attack strategy? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_reset()] [State corruption] Does reset() properly clear all in-flight broadcast handles and pending aggregation tasks, or can zombie tasks continue processing shares for old rounds after a reset? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_randomness()] [Queue manipulation] If block_queue.item_mut() returns None for a valid randomness round, is the randomness silently dropped, potentially causing blocks to be stuck in the queue forever? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_response()] [Serialization failure] The expect() call on to_bytes() will panic if message serialization fails - can a Byzantine validator trigger this by providing malformed data structures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration injection] Are the rb_config parameters (timeouts, backoff policies) validated to prevent extremely large values that could cause integer overflow or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::verify()] [Index validation] Can address_to_validator_index() return an out-of-bounds index that accesses invalid memory in certified_apks[], bypassing BLS signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::verify()] [Missing key] If certified_apks[index].get() returns None, the function bails - can a Byzantine validator exploit the timing of when APKs are added to cause verification failures for honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::generate()] [Unwrap panic] The .unwrap() on bcs serialization can panic - can a Byzantine validator craft invalid RandMetadata that causes this unwrap to panic during share generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::aggregate()] [Weight manipulation] Does the aggregation properly validate that the total weight of apks_and_proofs matches expectations, or can a Byzantine validator include duplicate shares with inflated weights? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::aggregate()] [Invalid APK] If get_certified_apk() returns None for a share author, the function bails - can Byzantine validators cause DoS by ensuring their APKs are never certified? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::aggregate()] [Player ID mismatch] Can a Byzantine validator provide shares with mismatched Player IDs and addresses to cause WVUF aggregate_shares() to produce incorrect proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::aggregate()] [Proof verification bypass] Does WVUF::derive_eval() properly validate that the aggregated proof is constructed from valid certified APKs, or can pre-computed proofs be injected? (Critical)"
