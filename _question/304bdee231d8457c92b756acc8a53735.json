  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Rollback Handling] If a commit is rolled back due to fork, are rollback notifications sent, or does the storage service maintain stale state? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: StorageServiceNotificationSender] [Trait Safety] Does requiring Send + Clone + Sync + 'static properly constrain implementations, or can unsafe implementations violate thread safety? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotifier] [Debug Output] Does the Debug derive on StorageServiceNotifier expose sensitive channel internals that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Clone Timing] Does cloning the sender at line 85 introduce a timing window where the original sender could be dropped, causing send to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotifier] [Clone Semantics] Does Clone create a new independent sender or share state with the original, and can this cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Constant: STORAGE_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SIZE] [Priority Inversion] Can high-priority urgent notifications be dropped in favor of lower-priority routine notifications due to LIFO ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Critical Notification Loss] Are there certain version numbers (e.g., epoch boundaries) that should never be dropped, and does LIFO queuing violate this? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Error] [Incomplete Error Types] Should Error include variants for channel closed, timeout, serialization failure, etc., or is CommitNotificationError too coarse-grained? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Error Detail] Does the error message at lines 89-90 include enough context (version number, timestamp) for debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Notification Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on notifications to prevent a malicious state sync driver from spamming the storage service? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceCommitNotification] [Notification Size] Can an attacker craft notifications with pathological fields that consume excessive memory or CPU during processing? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Await Point] Does the async function have proper cancellation points, or can it block indefinitely if the channel is in a bad state? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Executor Fairness] Can notify_new_commit() hog the executor thread, starving other tasks and causing liveness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_storage_service_notifier_listener_pair()] [Initialization Race] Can concurrent calls to the factory function create race conditions in channel initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotificationListener] [State Corruption] Can the receiver's internal state be corrupted by unexpected input or malicious notifications? (Medium)",
