  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Memory Leaks] Are all allocated resources (graph nodes, maps, strings) properly cleaned up, or can repeated resolutions cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Dependency Pinning] Does the resolution process properly respect pinned dependencies in the lock file, or can an attacker force re-resolution to newer malicious versions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Typosquatting] Is there any protection against typosquatting attacks where an attacker creates packages with names similar to popular packages? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Repository Takeover] If a git repository used in dependencies is transferred to a malicious owner, will the resolver detect this and warn users? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Package Substitution] Can an attacker perform a package substitution attack by registering a package on-chain that shadows a legitimate local or git package? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Empty Dependency List] How does the resolver handle packages with zero dependencies - are there any edge case bugs in the iteration logic? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Circular Identity] Can an attacker create a package identity that resolves to itself through path normalization, creating subtle bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Mixed Dependency Types] Are there edge cases when a package has a mix of local, git, and on-chain dependencies that could cause inconsistent resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Network Timeout] Are there proper timeout mechanisms for network operations (git fetch, on-chain package fetch), or can slow responses cause indefinite hangs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Retry Logic] If a network operation fails, does the resolver retry in a way that could amplify DoS attacks or cause thundering herd problems? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Partial Resolution] If resolution fails partway through, is the partial graph safely discarded or could it be reused leading to inconsistent state? (Medium)"
