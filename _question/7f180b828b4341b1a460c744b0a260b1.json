  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Filter Application Overhead] Under high transaction throughput (100k+ TPS), can the overhead of calling is_enabled() and filter methods on every transaction cause performance bottlenecks? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 36-43] [Hot Path Optimization] Are is_enabled() and filter reference getters optimized for the hot path, or do they involve unnecessary allocations or checks? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Config Clone Cost] When TransactionFiltersConfig is cloned across threads, does this involve expensive deep copies of all filter rules, impacting scalability? (Low)",

  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 13-17] [Selective Filtering] Can validators selectively enable filters only for certain components (e.g., api_filter but not consensus_filter) to accept censored transactions via consensus while blocking them via API? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Filter Transparency] Are filter configurations publicly visible and auditable, or can validators hide their filtering criteria to covertly censor transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Emergency Filtering] Can emergency filter updates be deployed quickly in response to active attacks without requiring full node restarts or consensus, and does this create centralization risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Filter Accountability] When transactions are filtered, is there sufficient logging and auditability to identify which filter rule triggered rejection and hold operators accountable? (Low)",

  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Backward Compatibility] Are there tests ensuring new filter configuration versions can be deserialized by older node versions, preventing network partitions during upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Line: 87 in node_config.rs] [NodeConfig Integration] When TransactionFiltersConfig is embedded in NodeConfig, can other config fields override or interact unexpectedly with filter configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Config Reload Safety] If NodeConfig is hot-reloaded to update filters, are there race conditions between reading old and new TransactionFiltersConfig that could cause inconsistent filtering? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/transaction_filters_config.rs] [Entire File] [Config Validation Pipeline] Does the NodeConfig loading pipeline validate TransactionFiltersConfig internally consistent before applying it, or can invalid configs be loaded? (Medium)",
