  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Timing side channel] Do the elapsed_time observations (lines 236, 304) leak information about handshake internals that could help attackers optimize cryptographic attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Metric flooding] Could an attacker flood the connection_upgrade_time metrics with observations, causing metric storage exhaustion or query performance degradation? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Listen address override] Can the listen_addr parameter to new() be manipulated to bind to unintended interfaces (e.g., 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost), exposing the validator to external attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Transport configuration] Is the TTransport instance properly configured with security parameters before being passed to new(), or could misconfiguration weaken connection security? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [NetworkContext isolation] Does each TransportHandler get a unique NetworkContext, or could shared contexts create cross-contamination of logs and metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [TSocket constraints] Are the AsyncRead and AsyncWrite trait bounds on TSocket sufficient to prevent malicious socket implementations from violating protocol invariants? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Generic type inference] Could type inference failures in upgrade futures cause runtime errors or panics that crash the validator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [State transition atomicity] Are connection state transitions from pending to established atomic, or could race conditions leave connections in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Duplicate connection handling] If two dial requests for the same PeerId arrive concurrently, are both processed, potentially creating duplicate connections that confuse PeerManager? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Connection replacement] When a new connection to a peer is established, is there logic to close/replace an existing connection, or can multiple connections to the same peer coexist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Pending state timeout] Do connections stuck in the pending state (in FuturesUnordered) eventually timeout, or can they remain pending forever, leaking resources? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [PeerId verification asymmetry] Why do outbound connections verify PeerId (line 239-247) but inbound connections don't - does this create an identity verification gap? (Critical)",
