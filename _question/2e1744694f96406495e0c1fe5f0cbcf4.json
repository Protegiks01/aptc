  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Const: MODULE_NAME] [Module name mismatch] The MODULE_NAME is 'token_event_store' - can this cause issues if the actual on-chain module has a different name, breaking event type matching or causing events to be ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Const: STRUCT_NAME] [Struct name collision] Could there be name collisions with other structs named 'DefaultPropertyMutate' in different modules, causing type confusion when deserializing events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Static: DEFAULT_PROPERTY_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] The TypeTag uses TOKEN_ADDRESS as the module address - can attackers forge events with a different address to bypass event filtering or cause type mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Static: DEFAULT_PROPERTY_MUTATE_TYPE] [Empty type_args] The StructTag has empty type_args - is this correct for all use cases, or could generic versions of DefaultPropertyMutate exist, causing deserialization to wrong types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type registration] Does the MoveStructType trait implementation ensure this struct is properly registered with the Move VM? Can failures in registration cause events to be undeserializable or ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version mismatch] The struct implements MoveEventV2Type - is there backward compatibility with V1 events? Can mixing V1 and V2 events for the same token cause state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Trait implementations] [Serialization consistency] Does the Serialize/Deserialize implementation match the Move VM's expectations exactly? Can subtle serialization differences cause events to be rejected or misinterpreted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas cost transparency] Is the gas cost of creating large DefaultPropertyMutate events properly accounted for? Can attackers exploit underpriced event creation to spam the event log cheaply? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization gas] Is there proper gas metering during BCS deserialization? Can malicious events with pathological structures (deep nesting, large vectors) consume excessive gas during validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Getter methods] [Gas-free reads] Since getters return references, are multiple reads properly gas-metered, or can contracts query event data repeatedly without cost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Concurrent mutations] Can multiple transactions concurrently mutate the same token properties, and are events emitted in the correct order reflecting the actual mutation sequence as committed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Thread safety] If events are deserialized concurrently across multiple threads (parallel execution), are there any shared mutable state or unsafe operations that could cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error propagation] When BCS deserialization fails, does the error provide enough information to diagnose the issue without leaking sensitive data? Can error messages be used to probe for valid event structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial deserialization] If deserialization fails midway, are there memory leaks or partial state corruption that could accumulate over many failed attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Event spoofing] Can malicious contracts emit DefaultPropertyMutate events that appear to come from legitimate token contracts, fooling indexers or off-chain systems into accepting fake mutations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Cross-module event emission] Can contracts outside the token_event_store module emit these events, bypassing authorization checks that should only allow the official token contract to emit them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Indexer poisoning] Can attackers emit events with malformed data (e.g., SQL injection in string fields) that crash or compromise off-chain indexers parsing these events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Event spam] Without rate limiting, can attackers emit millions of property mutation events with minimal cost, overwhelming indexers or bloating the event log? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Schema evolution] If the DefaultPropertyMutate struct needs new fields in the future, is there a migration path that maintains backward compatibility with existing events in the log? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: PropertyValue] [Type system evolution] If Move's type system is extended with new types, can the current typ string representation accommodate them without breaking existing events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Mutation history tampering] Can the absence of cryptographic signatures on events allow validators to selectively omit or reorder mutation events, hiding suspicious property changes from auditors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: old_values] [Incomplete audit trail] If old_values are None (new property creation), is this distinguishable from failed validation or attacker omission? Can attackers hide previous values to obscure mutation history? (Medium)",

Can different valid encodings of the same logical value cause event comparison to fail? (Low)",
