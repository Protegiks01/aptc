  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Not] [Not Argument Validation] When the Not operation receives a non-constant argument, does constant_folding_error always emit diagnostics, or can it silently fail in non-constant contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Overflow] Can casting large values to smaller types (e.g., u128 -> u8 with value 300) bypass type_bound_bigint validation and produce wrapped/truncated values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Underflow] When casting negative signed values to unsigned types, does type_bound_bigint properly reject the cast, or can it accept out-of-range values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Non-Numeric Types] Can cast operations be performed on non-numeric types (Bool, Vector, etc.) and bypass the is_number() checks, causing type corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Result Range] If a cast result is technically within type bounds but represents an invalid value for the target semantics (e.g., negative value cast to unsigned), can this cause logic errors in smart contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Precision Loss] When casting from larger to smaller types with valid ranges, can precision loss or truncation cause economic calculation errors in token or staking constants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Type Confusion] Can casting between signed and unsigned types of the same width cause sign bit misinterpretation, leading to incorrect constant values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: fold_unary_exp() - O::Cast] [Cast Error Message] When cast fails due to out-of-range values, does the error message correctly identify the value and target type, or can it leak sensitive information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [Missing Min Bound] When get_min_value() returns None for a type, can values below the actual minimum be accepted, causing invalid constants to be stored? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [Missing Max Bound] When get_max_value() returns None for a type, can values above the actual maximum be accepted, leading to overflow in runtime execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [Inclusive vs Exclusive Bounds] Are the comparisons (>= min_val, max_val >=) using correct inclusive bounds, or can off-by-one errors allow values exactly at type limits to be incorrectly rejected/accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [BigInt Comparison Edge Cases] Can BigInt comparison operations in filter() produce incorrect results for very large or very small values near type boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [Type Without Bounds] For custom or future primitive types without defined min/max values, can type_bound_bigint accept arbitrary values that cause runtime errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: type_bound_bigint()] [Chain Filter Logic] Does chaining two filter() calls for min and max correctly handle cases where both bounds are violated, or can one check mask the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: constant_folding_error()] [Error Flag Bypass] Can the error_status flag be reset or bypassed in nested expression evaluation, allowing errors in sub-expressions to be ignored while the parent expression succeeds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: clear_error_status()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads perform constant folding simultaneously, can race conditions on error_status cause errors to be lost or misattributed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: merge_old_error_status()] [Status Merge Logic] Can the boolean OR in merge_old_error_status incorrectly handle cascading errors, causing some error conditions to be ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: constant_folding_error()] [Duplicate Error Emission] When error_status is already true, errors are suppressed - can this hide secondary errors that provide critical debugging information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: rewrite_exp()] [Error Status Not Restored] If rewrite_exp_descent panics or returns early, can saved_error_status fail to be restored via merge_old_error_status, causing error state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/constant_folder.rs] [Function: constant_folding_error()] [Context Flag Check] Does checking in_constant_declaration correctly distinguish between constant and non-constant contexts, or can non-const expressions bypass error diagnostics? (Medium)",
