  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Type: ProtocolId] [Protocol array indexing] Line 71 uses RPC[0] hardcoded - what if RPC array is empty or has different length in different builds? Can this cause out-of-bounds access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Type: Bytes] [Size validation] Bytes type is used for raw messages - is there a maximum size check to prevent memory exhaustion from extremely large DKG transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Type: Duration] [Negative duration] Can timeout_duration be negative, causing immediate timeout or overflow in duration calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Error: send_rpc()] [Bail macro usage] Line 79 uses bail!() which returns early - can this leave resources in inconsistent state or unclosed channels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Error: start()] [Silent error logging] Line 174 only logs errors without propagating - can critical DKG failures be hidden from upper layers that should halt the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Error: RealRpcResponseSender] [Ignored Result] Line 208 ignores send() Result - can this cause deadlocks where the requester waits forever for a response that failed to send? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Error: Nested Results] [Triple Ok unwrapping] Line 74 has nested Ok(Ok(Ok(bytes))) - can any of these layers fail silently or be exploited to bypass error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Error: anyhow::Result] [Error type erasure] Extensive use of anyhow::Result loses type information - can this prevent proper error handling for specific DKG protocol violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [State: NetworkTask] [Task lifecycle] If NetworkTask::start() exits early due to stream exhaustion, can the validator be left in a half-initialized state unable to process DKG messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [State: RealRpcResponseSender] [Use-after-consume] After send() consumes the inner sender (line 208), can the struct be reused causing panic on subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Ordering: FIFO queue] [Head-of-line blocking] With FIFO queue style (line 141), can a slow-processing message block all subsequent messages even if they're from different senders? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Ordering: select_all] [Non-deterministic ordering] Does select_all() (line 152) maintain any ordering guarantees, or can message reordering cause DKG transcript aggregation to fail? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [DKG: Transcript distribution] Can an attacker intercept DKG transcripts in transit by observing NetworkSender's unencrypted RPC calls, compromising the distributed key generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [DKG: Epoch boundaries] Does the network layer validate that DKG messages are from the correct epoch, or can epoch confusion allow mixing transcripts from different validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [DKG: Partial transcript] Can an attacker send incomplete or corrupted DKG transcripts that appear valid during transmission but fail during cryptographic verification, wasting validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [DKG: Transcript replay] Can old DKG transcripts be replayed to force validators to reprocess them, causing computational DoS or state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [DKG: Selective distribution] Can a malicious validator use to_bytes_by_protocol() to send different DKG transcript versions to different peers, breaking DKG consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Memory: DKGMessage cloning] Line 72 clones the entire DKGMessage for self-sends - can large transcripts cause excessive memory usage or copying overhead? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Memory: Response collection] DummyRpcResponseSender collects all responses in memory (line 226) - is there a cleanup mechanism or can this grow unbounded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Memory: BoxedStream] all_events is Box<dyn Stream> (line 131) - does boxing add overhead, and can the stream buffer messages internally causing memory growth? (Low)",
