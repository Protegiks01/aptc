  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Single chunk] When a field element fits in a single chunk (e.g., small values with num_bits=64), are there special cases that could cause reconstruction to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Maximum chunks] What is the maximum number of chunks that can be produced, and can this be exploited to cause integer overflow in chunk count calculations at line 15? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: le_chunks_to_scalar()] [Chunk with leading zeros] Can chunks with leading zero bytes be misinterpreted during reconstruction, potentially corrupting high-order bits of the reconstructed scalar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Byte alignment] When num_bits is not aligned with field element bit length, can partial bytes in the last chunk cause information loss or corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks + le_chunks_to_scalar] [Version compatibility] If validators run different versions of this code with updated chunk logic, can this cause DKG to fail due to incompatible share representations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Compiler optimization] Can different Rust compiler optimization levels produce different chunking results due to floating-point or integer arithmetic differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: le_chunks_to_scalar()] [Accumulator initialization] Does F::zero() and F::one() at lines 39-40 produce identical results across all validators, or can field implementation differences cause reconstruction divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Share forgery] Can an attacker reverse-engineer the chunking algorithm to craft fake chunks that appear valid but reconstruct to attacker-controlled scalars? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: le_chunks_to_scalar()] [Partial share attack] If only some chunks are provided (missing or corrupted), does reconstruction fail cleanly, or can partial reconstruction leak information about the secret? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks + le_chunks_to_scalar] [Chunk reordering] Can Byzantine validators reorder chunks before reconstruction to produce different but valid-looking scalars, compromising DKG integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: scalar_to_le_chunks()] [Chunk duplication] Can duplicate chunks in the output vector cause reconstruction to double-count contributions, breaking the mathematical properties of secret sharing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunks.rs] [Function: test_chunk_unchunk_roundtrip] [Test coverage] The test at lines 58-75 only validates roundtrip for random values - are edge cases like 0, 1, modulus-1, and maximum field elements tested? (Medium)",
