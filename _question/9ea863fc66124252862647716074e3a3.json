  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker trigger the macro to output sensitive validator keys, private state data, or transaction details to stdout that could be captured through log files or process monitoring, leading to unauthorized access to confidential blockchain data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the macro have any rate limiting or size bounds? Could an attacker trigger infinite loops or massive data dumps through this macro, filling disk space with logs and causing validator node crashes or loss of liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Silent Failure] By silently ignoring write errors with 'let _ = writeln!', could critical error messages about consensus failures, state corruption, or security violations be dropped without operator awareness, masking attacks in progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Broken Pipe Attack] Can an attacker intentionally close stdout pipes to trigger the broken pipe error handling path repeatedly, causing performance degradation through continuous failed write attempts that bypass normal error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Format String Injection] If user-controlled data is passed to the $($arg:tt)* parameters without sanitization, could an attacker inject format specifiers that cause crashes, read memory, or trigger undefined behavior in the formatting logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Timing Attack] Could the silent error suppression create timing differences between successful writes and failed writes that leak information about system state, network conditions, or resource availability to adversaries monitoring execution time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Race Condition] When multiple threads invoke this macro concurrently writing to the same stdout handle, could race conditions cause interleaved output that corrupts diagnostic messages or creates ambiguous error logs during security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_println!] [Denial of Audit Trail] If this macro is used to log security-relevant events like consensus votes or validator actions, could the silent error suppression lead to incomplete audit trails that prevent post-incident forensics after attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker trigger error paths that use this macro to leak sensitive information like cryptographic keys, validator IP addresses, or internal state to stderr, which may be captured by system monitoring tools or log aggregation services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Silent Critical Errors] By suppressing write errors to stderr, could critical security alerts about Byzantine behavior, signature verification failures, or consensus violations be silently dropped, allowing attacks to proceed undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Error Message Injection] If attacker-controlled data flows into the macro parameters, could malicious formatting directives or escape sequences be injected to corrupt error logs, hide malicious activity, or inject false error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Log Flooding] Can an attacker trigger error conditions that repeatedly invoke this macro with large payloads, causing stderr log files to grow unboundedly and fill disk space on validator nodes, leading to crashes or loss of liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Error Suppression Bypass] Does the silent error handling ('let _ = writeln!') mask legitimate I/O errors that indicate file system corruption, disk failures, or security policy violations that should terminate the validator process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Concurrent Write Corruption] When multiple async tasks or threads simultaneously invoke this macro during error handling, could race conditions in stderr access corrupt error messages, making it impossible to diagnose consensus failures or security breaches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Macro: no_panic_eprintln!] [Security Monitoring Evasion] If security monitoring systems rely on stderr output to detect anomalies, could the silent error suppression allow attackers to evade detection by preventing error messages from reaching monitoring tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError] [Clone Safety] When multiple clones of ArcError share the same Arc<anyhow::Error>, could concurrent access from different threads during error handling lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities if the error contains non-thread-safe types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError] [Error Chain Manipulation] Can an attacker craft error chains with circular references or deeply nested sources that cause stack overflow when traversing with source() method, crashing validator nodes during error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError] [Memory Leak] If ArcError is cloned extensively during error propagation in long-running futures, could the Arc reference counting prevent error objects from being freed, causing memory leaks that degrade validator performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError::clone()] [Reference Count Overflow] Could an attacker trigger scenarios where the Arc reference count overflows through massive error cloning, leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or use-after-free when the count wraps around? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError::source()] [Unbounded Recursion] Does the source() method implementation have depth limits? Could an attacker construct error chains with thousands of nested sources that cause stack overflow during error display or logging operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError Display/Debug] [Information Disclosure] When ArcError is formatted for display or debug output, could it inadvertently leak sensitive information like validator keys, transaction signatures, or internal state through the underlying anyhow::Error's format implementation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError Display/Debug] [Format String Vulnerability] If the underlying anyhow::Error contains user-controlled data that flows into format strings, could the Display/Debug implementations trigger format string vulnerabilities or panics during error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError] [Type Confusion] Since ArcError wraps any anyhow::Error, could type confusion occur if code assumes specific error types but receives different types at runtime, leading to incorrect error handling that bypasses security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Struct: ArcError] [Panic in Error Handling] If the underlying Arc or anyhow::Error panics during Clone, Display, or Debug operations, could this cause the validator process to crash during critical error handling paths like consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/common.rs] [Constant: IP_LOCAL_HOST] [Network Binding Bypass] If IP_LOCAL_HOST (127.0.0.1) is used to bind services intended to be local-only, could IPv6 localhost (::1) bypass these restrictions, allowing remote access to services that should only be accessible locally?
