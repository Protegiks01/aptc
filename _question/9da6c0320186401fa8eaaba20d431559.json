(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_cross_shard_client.rs] [Struct: RemoteCrossShardClient] [Arc contention] Does the Arc<Vec<...>> structure (lines 16, 18) create performance bottlenecks under high concurrency, potentially degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
