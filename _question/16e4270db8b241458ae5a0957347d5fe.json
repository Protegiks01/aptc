  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&NetworkIdentifier> for ChainId] [Error propagation] When ChainId::from_str fails, the error is converted to ApiError - does this preserve all critical error information for security auditing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: From<ChainId> for NetworkIdentifier] [BLOCKCHAIN constant] The function sets blockchain to BLOCKCHAIN constant - is this constant properly validated and immutable, or could it be tampered with? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: From<ChainId> for NetworkIdentifier] [Chain ID formatting] The function uses chain_id.to_string() - does ChainId's Display implementation properly sanitize output to prevent injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: by_hash()] [Hash validation] The function accepts any String as hash without validation - can attackers provide malformed hashes that cause parsing errors or database lookups to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: by_hash()] [Hash collision] Since hashes are fake (chain_id-block_height format), can attackers craft hash strings that match multiple blocks causing ambiguity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: by_hash()] [Index/hash conflict] What happens if both index and hash are set when they shouldn't be - does downstream code handle this correctly or could it cause inconsistent block retrieval? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: block_index()] [Index bounds] Does block_index() validate that the index is within valid blockchain height range, or could attackers query non-existent future blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: block_index()] [Genesis block] Can attackers specify index 0 to query genesis block in unexpected ways, potentially exposing sensitive initialization data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: From<&TransactionInfo>] [Hash extraction] The function calls txn.transaction_hash() - can this fail or return empty hash for certain transaction types, causing identifier creation to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: From<&TransactionInfo>] [Hash format] The to_hex_lower() conversion - does it properly handle all hash values including edge cases like all-zeros or all-ones? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Function: From<aptos_crypto::HashValue>] [Hash validation] Can attackers provide HashValue instances with invalid or manipulated data that causes to_hex_lower() to produce incorrect identifiers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: AccountIdentifier] [Serialization bypass] The skip_serializing_if on sub_account field - can attackers deserialize AccountIdentifier with null sub_account that behaves differently than expected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: AccountIdentifier] [Address format] The address field is plain String without validation - can attackers create AccountIdentifier with arbitrary strings bypassing address validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: SubAccountIdentifier] [Address field overload] The address field serves multiple purposes (stake type OR 'stake-operator') - can this semantic overloading create confusion or security bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: SubAccountIdentifier] [Metadata consistency] Can attackers create SubAccountIdentifier where the address and metadata fields are inconsistent (e.g., address='stake' but metadata is set)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: SubAccountIdentifierMetadata] [Pool address validation] The pool_address is stored as String - are there any validation checks before this is used in staking operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: BlockIdentifier] [Fake hash] The hash field is described as 'fake hash' - does documentation clearly warn that this is NOT a cryptographic hash, preventing security assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: BlockIdentifier] [Index type] Using u64 for index - what happens at block height u64::MAX, does it wrap around or cause errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: OperationIdentifier] [Index ordering] The index must be 0 to n within transaction - is this validated, or can attackers provide out-of-order or duplicate indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: OperationIdentifier] [Index bounds] Can attackers provide extremely large index values (near u64::MAX) that cause array access issues in operation processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: PartialBlockIdentifier] [Ambiguity] If both index and hash are Some, which takes precedence? Can attackers exploit this ambiguity to query unexpected blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Struct: PartialBlockIdentifier] [Latest block] The latest() function sets both to None - is 'latest' always safe, or could rapid chain reorgs cause race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Cross-function: base_account() & is_base_account()] [Consistency] Can an attacker manually construct AccountIdentifier that passes is_base_account() but wasn't created via base_account(), bypassing initialization logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Cross-function: total_stake_account() & is_total_stake()] [Type safety] Is there guaranteed consistency between all stake account constructors and their corresponding is_* validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/identifiers.rs] [Cross-function: operator_stake_account() & operator_address()] [Round-trip] If you create an operator_stake_account then call operator_address(), is the original operator guaranteed to be recovered correctly? (Medium)"
