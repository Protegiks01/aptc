  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Type: PeerMonitoringMetadata] [No authentication] Since PeerMonitoringMetadata contains no cryptographic signatures or MACs, can any peer claim arbitrary metadata values without detection, making all metadata-based decisions vulnerable to Sybil attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Field: distance_from_validators] [Trust transitivity] The distance calculation trusts peer-reported distances transitively - can a single compromised peer at distance 0 (malicious validator) infect the entire network by making all its peers appear at distance 1? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringMetadata] [No validation] There are no validation functions to check metadata consistency - can production code accept and process structurally valid but semantically nonsensical metadata that causes unpredictable behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringMetadata] [Fuzzing gaps] Have all possible float values (NaN, infinity, subnormals, negative zero) been tested in average_ping_latency_secs and latest_ping_latency_secs fields to ensure they don't cause undefined behavior in comparison or arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: request] [Ping counter overflow] The LatencyPingRequest contains a u64 ping_counter that should monotonically increase - can counter overflow at u64::MAX wrap to 0, breaking monotonicity checks and allowing replay of old ping responses with the same counter value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: request] [Counter desync] If ping_counter gets out of sync between client and server, can an attacker replay old LatencyPingResponse messages with mismatched counters to inject false latency measurements into PeerMonitoringMetadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: response] [Response size attacks] The get_num_bytes() method in PeerMonitoringServiceResponse can fail during serialization - can this be exploited to create messages that serialize successfully once but fail to serialize on subsequent attempts, causing inconsistent message size limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/lib.rs] [Module: response] [TryFrom conversions] The TryFrom implementations for response types return UnexpectedResponseError - can type confusion attacks cause critical Response variants to be misinterpreted as different types, bypassing validation logic? (Medium)"
