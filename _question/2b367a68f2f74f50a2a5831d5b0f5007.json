  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/index.rs] [AccountTransactions] [Mutual Exclusivity] Transactions should exist in either nonce_transactions OR sequence_number_transactions, never both - can insert() be called twice with different ReplayProtector types for the same transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/index.rs] [Struct: OrderedQueueKey] [AccountAddress Ordering] Addresses are compared for priority - can attackers generate accounts with adversarially chosen addresses (e.g., all 0xFF bytes) to gain persistent priority advantage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/index.rs] [Struct: OrderedQueueKey] [Gas Ranking Score Limits] gas_ranking_score is u64 - can setting this to u64::MAX cause integer overflow in related calculations elsewhere in the codebase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/index.rs] [Struct: TTLOrderingKey] [Duration Edge Cases] Can Duration::MAX be used as expiration_time to ensure a transaction never expires but remains in TTLIndex indefinitely consuming memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/index.rs] [Function: AccountTransactions::clear()] [Incomplete Cleanup] clear() removes entries from both maps - but can references to transactions held elsewhere become dangling after clear? (Medium)"
