  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command injection] Can an attacker exploit the clap::Parser::parse() call on line 9 by providing malicious command-line arguments that bypass validation in ServerArgs, potentially leading to path traversal when loading the config file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path traversal] Does the config_path parameter parsed on line 9 properly validate against directory traversal attacks (e.g., ../../etc/passwd), allowing attackers to load arbitrary files as configuration and potentially expose sensitive data or cause crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Symlink exploitation] Can an attacker create malicious symlinks and pass them through the config_path argument on line 9, causing the service to read sensitive system files or follow circular symlinks leading to resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Argument injection] Are there sufficient protections in ServerArgs::parse() on line 9 against shell metacharacter injection in command-line arguments that could affect subsequent operations in the run() method? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode normalization] Does the clap parser on line 9 handle Unicode normalization attacks in file paths, where visually identical but byte-different paths could bypass security checks in downstream config loading? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Type confusion] Can the generic type parameter NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig on line 10 be exploited through type confusion if the RunnableConfig trait is implemented incorrectly, leading to undefined behavior or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Trait bound violation] If NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig fails to properly implement all required bounds of RunnableConfig trait used on line 10, could this lead to runtime panics or unsafe behavior during server initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Deserialization exploit] Since NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig must implement DeserializeOwned (required by run()), can malicious YAML in the config file exploit deserialization vulnerabilities when loaded on line 10? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Runtime poisoning] Can an attacker exploit the tokio::main macro on line 7 to poison the async runtime with malicious tasks before args.run() executes on line 10, potentially intercepting or manipulating server behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Thread exhaustion] Does the tokio runtime initialized by the macro on line 7 have proper thread pool limits, or can an attacker cause unbounded thread creation through the run() call on line 10? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async cancellation] If the run() method on line 10 is cancelled or aborted, are there proper cleanup handlers to prevent resource leaks or inconsistent state in the NFT metadata crawler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Task spawn exploit] Can the run() method on line 10 spawn unbounded tokio tasks without proper limits, allowing DoS through task exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error disclosure] Does the anyhow::Result return type on line 8 properly sanitize error messages before they're printed to stderr, potentially leaking sensitive information about the system configuration or internal paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic exploitation] If args.run() on line 10 panics instead of returning an error, could this bypass cleanup logic and leave the system in an inconsistent state, potentially affecting other services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error chain exhaustion] Can an attacker craft config files that cause deeply nested error contexts in the run() call on line 10, leading to stack exhaustion when errors are formatted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unwrap bypass] Are there hidden .unwrap() or .expect() calls within the run() chain on line 10 that could cause panics instead of proper error propagation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [YAML bomb] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted YAML config file through the args parsed on line 9 that causes excessive memory consumption or CPU usage during deserialization in run()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Config injection] Does the run() method on line 10 properly validate all NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig fields, or can an attacker inject malicious database connection strings, API endpoints, or file paths through the config? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment variable override] Can the configuration loaded by run() on line 10 be overridden by environment variables in a way that bypasses file-based security controls or validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [TOCTOU race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between when the config file path is validated and when it's actually loaded by run() on line 10, allowing file substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Billion laughs attack] Does the YAML parser used by run() on line 10 protect against billion laughs or entity expansion attacks in the configuration file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege escalation] If this service is started with elevated privileges, does the run() method on line 10 properly drop privileges before processing untrusted data, or could an attacker exploit elevated permissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal handling] Are SIGTERM, SIGINT, and other signals properly handled during the run() execution on line 10, or can abrupt termination leave NFT metadata or database state corrupted? (Medium)",
