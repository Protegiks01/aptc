  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Input validation] Does the faucet_port field (line 34) validate that the port number is within valid TCP port range (1-65535), or can an attacker pass port 0 or invalid values causing service binding failures or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Port conflict] Can the faucet_port (line 34) conflict with other services (node API, indexer API) if set to the same value, potentially causing service startup failures or allowing port hijacking attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Configuration bypass] Can the no_faucet flag (line 21) be bypassed or ignored through race conditions during service initialization, causing the faucet to run when it shouldn't? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Backwards compatibility] Does the deprecated with_faucet flag (line 27) create security confusion where users might incorrectly believe they're controlling faucet behavior, leading to unintended production faucet exposure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Delegation security] Can the do_not_delegate flag (line 38) be manipulated to force direct root account usage for minting, bypassing the security isolation provided by delegated minting and potentially exposing the root private key to more attack surface? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Path traversal] In line 60 where test_dir.join('mint.key') constructs the key file path, can an attacker manipulate test_dir to contain path traversal sequences (../) to access or overwrite sensitive key files outside the intended directory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Key file security] Does the FunderKeyEnum::KeyFile construction at line 60 verify that the mint.key file has proper permissions (not world-readable), or can unauthorized local users read the faucet's private key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Symlink attack] Can test_dir or the mint.key path be a symlink pointing to sensitive system files, allowing an attacker to trick the faucet into using arbitrary private keys or exposing key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Bind address validation] Does the bind_to parameter undergo validation to prevent binding to unintended network interfaces (e.g., 0.0.0.0 exposing the faucet publicly when only localhost was intended)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [URL validation] Is the node_api_url parameter validated to prevent SSRF attacks where an attacker could make the faucet connect to arbitrary internal services or external endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Error propagation] Does the Result return type properly propagate all errors from RunConfig::build_for_cli, or can certain error conditions be silently ignored leading to misconfigured faucet services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to new() with the same test_dir create race conditions in reading/writing the mint.key file, potentially corrupting the key or causing service initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Resource exhaustion] If prerequisite_health_checkers contains excessive or circular dependencies, can this cause the faucet service to never start, leading to denial of service for the local testnet? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker manipulate the args.faucet_args parameters to inject malicious configuration into RunConfig::build_for_cli, potentially disabling security checks or rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Amount manipulation] Does build_for_cli's amount_to_fund parameter have upper bounds validation, or can the configuration result in excessive minting amounts that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Bypasser configuration] Since build_for_cli sets empty bypasser_configs, can this create security assumptions that are violated if the configuration is later modified, removing authentication requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: FaucetManager::new()] [Checker configuration] With empty checker_configs in build_for_cli, are there any rate limits or abuse prevention mechanisms, or can an attacker drain the faucet through automated requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: get_name()] [Service identification] Can the hardcoded 'Faucet' name (line 72) be exploited to confuse logging or monitoring systems, potentially hiding malicious activity in log files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: get_health_checkers()] [Health check bypass] Does the http_checker_from_port function (line 76-77) properly validate that the port is actually responding to HTTP requests, or can an attacker spoof health checks by binding to the port without running a proper faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: get_health_checkers()] [Port confusion] Can self.config.server_config.listen_port be different from the initialized faucet_port, causing health checks to monitor the wrong service or creating split-brain scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: get_prerequisite_health_checkers()] [Dependency chain attack] Can an attacker manipulate prerequisite health checkers to create false positives/negatives, causing the faucet to start when dependencies aren't ready or preventing legitimate startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: get_prerequisite_health_checkers()] [Circular dependencies] Does the prerequisite_health_checkers collection prevent circular dependencies that could cause deadlocks during service initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Ownership transfer] When self is moved into Box<Self> and run_service is called (line 86-88), are there any resource cleanup guarantees if the service fails mid-execution, or can this leak resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Error handling] Does self.config.run().await properly handle all error conditions from the underlying faucet server, or can panics or unhandled errors crash the entire local testnet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Async cancellation] If run_service is cancelled mid-execution, are there proper cleanup handlers to stop the faucet server gracefully and prevent zombie processes or leaked resources? (Medium)"
