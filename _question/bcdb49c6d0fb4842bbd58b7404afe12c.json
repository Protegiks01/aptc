  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Function: init_storage_config()] [Configuration tampering] Can an attacker manipulate the StorageTestConfig parameters (pruner_config, enable_storage_sharding, enable_indexer_grpc) after initialization to cause inconsistent storage states across validators, leading to state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageTestConfig] [Integer manipulation] Does the pruner_config allow setting pruner windows to 0 or negative values that could cause immediate pruning of critical state data, resulting in permanent loss of blockchain history?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Function: init_storage_config()] [Parser manipulation] Can parser_task_count or parser_batch_size be set to extreme values (0 or MAX) to cause indexer deadlock or memory exhaustion during transaction processing? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Function: init_db()] [Path traversal] Can config.storage.get_dir_paths() be manipulated to point to arbitrary filesystem locations, allowing an attacker to overwrite critical system files or read sensitive data? (High)",

(Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Function: init_indexer_wrapper()] [Indexer desynchronization] If indexer_async_v2.next_version() returns a stale or incorrect version, can this cause the indexer to permanently lag behind or miss critical state updates? (High)",
