  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: UnequivocalProposerElection] [Send/Sync Safety] The struct requires ProposerElection to be Send + Sync (line 19) - can violations of these bounds cause data races or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Lifetime Issues] The Block reference has lifetime 'a implicitly - can lifetime elision issues cause use-after-free if the block is dropped before validation completes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Clone vs Reference] The round and block ID values are copied/cloned during comparison - can this introduce performance issues or inconsistencies if the Block struct is modified concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: UnequivocalProposerElection] [Drop Implementation] There's no explicit Drop implementation - can this cause resource leaks if the proposer_election Arc is not properly released? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [HashValue Birthday Attack] With HashValue being 32 bytes (256 bits), can an attacker leverage birthday paradox to find hash collisions for block IDs with ~2^128 attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Weak Hash Function] If block.id() uses a deprecated or weak hash function, can this make collision attacks practical for well-resourced attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Hash Length Extension] If the hash function is vulnerable to length extension attacks, can attackers craft blocks with predictable IDs to bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Deterministic Hash] Is block.id() deterministic - if different validators compute different IDs for the same block, can this cause inconsistent equivocation detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Hash Malleability] Can an attacker modify block contents in ways that don't affect the hash (e.g., transaction ordering if not included in hash), bypassing equivocation detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Block Author Optionality] Why is block.author() an Option type - can blocks legitimately have no author, and how does this interact with equivocation detection for system-generated blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Same Round Same Hash] When already_proposed.1 == block.id() for the same round (line 80), the function returns true - can this allow replay of identical proposals to waste network resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Round Zero Handling] Since initialization sets round to 0 (line 38), how are actual round 0 proposals handled - can this cause issues at genesis or epoch boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Concurrent Round Updates] If two proposals for rounds N and N+1 arrive simultaneously, can race conditions cause the N+1 proposal to be processed first, causing the N proposal to be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Malformed Block] If block.round() or block.id() panic due to malformed block data, can this poison the mutex and halt all validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: get_valid_proposer()] [Proposer Consistency] If get_valid_proposer() is called multiple times for the same round with different results (non-deterministic), can this break equivocation detection logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Security Event Volume] Can an attacker trigger excessive SecurityEvent logs (lines 50-57, 71-78) to cause disk space exhaustion or log rotation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Validator Set Changes] When validator sets change (e.g., through staking), can the underlying proposer_election give inconsistent results that break equivocation detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: UnequivocalProposerElection] [Multiple Instances] If multiple UnequivocalProposerElection instances are created for the same validator, can they have inconsistent already_proposed states leading to consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Proposal Buffering] If proposals are buffered and processed out-of-order, can the round ordering logic (line 63) cause legitimate proposals to be incorrectly rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Upstream Validation] Does is_valid_proposal() assume blocks are pre-validated (signatures, structure), or can malformed blocks cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Downstream Assumptions] Do callers assume is_valid_proposal() performs complete validation, or can bypasses here allow invalid blocks to reach consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Error Recovery] If is_valid_proposal() returns false, how do callers handle this - can improper error handling lead to consensus halts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Struct: UnequivocalProposerElection] [Wrapper Layering] Can multiple security wrappers (UnequivocalProposerElection, CachedProposerElection) create unexpected interactions that weaken security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Proposal Source] Does this function validate proposals from all sources equally (network, local generation), or can internal proposals bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/unequivocal_proposer_election.rs] [Function: is_valid_proposal()] [Network Partition] During network partitions, can different validator subsets have divergent already_proposed states that cause issues when partitions heal? (High)"
