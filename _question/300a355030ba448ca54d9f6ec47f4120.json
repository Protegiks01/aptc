  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow when encoding Version as big-endian bytes if the version number approaches u64::MAX, potentially causing incorrect ordering in RocksDB and leading to state inconsistencies across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Buffer overflow] Does decode_key() properly validate that the input slice is exactly size_of::<Version>() bytes before calling read_u64::<BigEndian>(), or can malformed data with incorrect length bypass ensure_slice_len_eq and cause memory safety issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Data corruption] Can an attacker corrupt the RocksDB database by inserting Version keys with non-big-endian encoding, causing decode_key() to return incorrect version numbers and breaking the transaction ordering invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Endianness attack] Can a malicious validator exploit endianness confusion by storing Version keys in little-endian format instead of big-endian, causing transaction info records to be retrieved in incorrect order and breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Size validation bypass] Does ensure_slice_len_eq properly handle edge cases where data.len() could be manipulated through memory corruption, allowing undersized or oversized buffers to pass validation and cause read_u64 to access invalid memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Serialization bomb] Can an attacker craft a TransactionInfo with deeply nested optional fields (state_checkpoint_hash, auxiliary_info_hash) that cause bcs::to_bytes() to consume excessive memory or stack space, leading to validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Malformed BCS] Can an attacker inject malformed BCS-encoded TransactionInfo data into RocksDB that passes initial validation but causes bcs::from_bytes() to panic or return inconsistent state, leading to validator divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Type confusion] Does bcs::from_bytes() properly validate the TransactionInfo enum discriminant (V0), or can an attacker inject data with invalid discriminants causing type confusion and arbitrary memory access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Hash collision] Can an attacker craft two different TransactionInfo objects that serialize to the same BCS bytes due to optional field encoding ambiguities, enabling transaction info replacement attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [BCS max size] Does decode_value() enforce a maximum size limit on the input data slice, or can an attacker provide gigabyte-sized payloads that cause memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Gas manipulation] Can an attacker modify the gas_used field in stored TransactionInfo to be inconsistent with actual execution, enabling refund attacks or fee manipulation that violates economic invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Hash tampering] Can a malicious validator modify transaction_hash, state_change_hash, or event_root_hash fields in stored TransactionInfo to break Merkle proof verification and enable state forgery attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Status manipulation] Can an attacker flip the ExecutionStatus in TransactionInfo from Failed to Success (or vice versa) to cause inconsistent ledger state where failed transactions appear executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Optional field injection] Can an attacker inject state_checkpoint_hash or auxiliary_info_hash into TransactionInfo records where they should be None, breaking protocol assumptions about when these fields are populated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Checkpoint inconsistency] Does the schema validate that state_checkpoint_hash is present when expected according to protocol configuration, or can missing checkpoint hashes break state synchronization? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionInfoSchema] [Duplicate versions] Does the schema prevent insertion of multiple TransactionInfo records with the same Version key, or can duplicate entries cause non-deterministic retrieval and validator divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionInfoSchema] [Tombstone attack] Can an attacker insert tombstone markers or empty values for Version keys that cause RocksDB iteration to skip valid transactions, leading to incomplete state synchronization?
