  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Contract violation] Does the trait definition enforce any ordering guarantees between receive_execute_command() and send_execution_result() calls, or can implementations violate execution order causing state inconsistencies across shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Concurrency issue] Since the trait requires Send + Sync bounds, can concurrent calls to receive_execute_command() from multiple threads cause race conditions in implementations that don't properly synchronize channel access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Memory safety] Does the trait contract specify any lifetime guarantees for the StateView parameter S, or can implementations cause use-after-free bugs if the state view is dropped while commands are still being processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [Blocking behavior] Does the trait contract specify whether receive_execute_command() should block or return immediately, allowing implementations to cause deadlocks by blocking indefinitely while holding critical locks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Error handling] The method signature takes Result<Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>>, VMStatus> but doesn't return a Result - can failures in sending results be silently ignored, causing the coordinator to hang waiting for results that will never arrive? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [Channel poisoning] In the LocalCoordinatorClient implementation, can a malicious thread send malformed ExecutorShardCommand::ExecuteSubBlocks with corrupted StateView Arc pointers causing memory corruption when dereferenced? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [DoS attack] Can an attacker flood the command channel with ExecutorShardCommand messages faster than they can be processed, causing unbounded memory growth and OOM crashes in the executor shard? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [Command replay] Does the trait enforce any sequence numbers or nonces on commands, or can duplicate ExecutorShardCommand::ExecuteSubBlocks be replayed causing transactions to be executed multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Result tampering] Can a malicious implementation modify the Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> after execution but before sending, allowing manipulation of transaction outputs to steal funds or corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Channel overflow] In implementations using unbounded channels, can an attacker send excessive results causing the result channel to consume unbounded memory leading to OOM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [ExecutorShardCommand] [State isolation] When ExecutorShardCommand::ExecuteSubBlocks contains Arc<S> where S: StateView, can race conditions in the StateView implementation cause non-deterministic execution across different shards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [ExecutorShardCommand] [State poisoning] Can a malicious coordinator send ExecutorShardCommand with a poisoned StateView that returns incorrect state values, causing shards to execute transactions with wrong preconditions and produce invalid outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [ExecutorShardCommand] [State consistency] Does the ExecutorShardCommand guarantee that all shards receive consistent StateView snapshots, or can timing differences cause shards to execute against different state versions leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Type bound: StateView] [Trait implementation bug] Since StateView must implement Sync + Send, can buggy implementations violate these contracts with interior mutability causing data races when accessed concurrently from multiple shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Output validation] Does the trait enforce any validation on the Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> structure, or can implementations send outputs with mismatched dimensions causing index out-of-bounds when aggregating results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Output ordering] Can implementations send TransactionOutput vectors in wrong order (e.g., by round or shard_id), causing the coordinator to aggregate results incorrectly and produce invalid final state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Partial results] Can an implementation send partial results (e.g., only some rounds completed) without indicating failure, causing the coordinator to commit incomplete block execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Output size manipulation] Can an attacker craft execution results with extremely large Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> consuming excessive memory during result aggregation, causing coordinator OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Error suppression] Can implementations send Ok(empty_vec) instead of Err(VMStatus) to hide execution failures, causing the coordinator to commit blocks that should have been rejected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [VMStatus manipulation] Can a malicious shard send Err(VMStatus::Executed) with a fabricated error to force block rejection even when execution succeeded, causing denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Error recovery] Does the trait specify how to handle VMStatus errors - are they fatal or recoverable? Can improper error handling cause the coordinator to retry already-committed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Thread safety] Since implementations must be Send + Sync, can incorrect use of interior mutability (e.g., Cell, RefCell without Mutex) in channel wrappers violate thread safety causing data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Lifetime safety] Does the 'static bound on StateView ensure that no dangling references exist, or can implementations that clone Arc<S> incorrectly cause premature StateView deallocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [Blocking deadlock] If receive_execute_command() blocks and send_execution_result() requires a lock held by receive_execute_command(), can this cause deadlocks halting execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Re-entrancy] If send_execution_result() is called while processing another command, can re-entrant calls cause race conditions in the channel sender corrupting the result stream?
