  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [String injection] Can an attacker define a custom type with a malicious name containing special characters (e.g., newlines, null bytes, control characters) that could bypass string validation or inject content when the type name is used in CheckResult.checker_name, potentially causing API response manipulation or log injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Unicode handling] Does the split('::') operation correctly handle Unicode characters in type names, or could specially crafted type names with Unicode lookalikes for '::' bypass the split logic and return unexpected full paths instead of just the final component? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [String boundary] Can type names with trailing or leading '::' separators cause the last() function to return empty strings, and would this empty string be used as checker_name in CheckResult, potentially causing confusion in API responses or breaking downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [String length] Are there limits on type name lengths returned by std::any::type_name, or could extremely long generated type names (e.g., from deeply nested generic types) cause memory issues or API response size limits when propagated to CheckResult objects? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Delimiter collision] What happens if a type name legitimately contains '::' within a string literal or as part of a complex generic parameter - does split('::').last() correctly extract only the final component, or could it truncate important type information leading to checker name collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Fallback exploitation] Under what conditions does std::any::type_name return a value where split('::').last() yields None, triggering the unwrap_or('UnknownType') fallback, and could an attacker deliberately trigger this to cause all checker results to have the same 'UnknownType' name, breaking result attribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Name collision] If multiple checkers somehow resolve to 'UnknownType' through the fallback path, would this cause CheckResult aggregation in CheckSummary to conflate different checker results, potentially hiding critical security issues in the summary_score calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Error masking] Does the unwrap_or('UnknownType') fallback silently hide legitimate type name resolution failures that should be surfaced to operators, allowing misconfigured or corrupted checkers to run without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Generic parameter injection] Can an attacker craft a Checker implementation with complex nested generics that causes std::any::type_name to return an extremely long or malformed string, exploiting the fact that get_type_name performs no validation on the extracted name before using it in API responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Type confusion] If two different Checker implementations resolve to the same final component after split('::').last() (e.g., 'module1::CheckerA' and 'module2::CheckerA'), would this cause checker name collisions in CheckResult objects, making it impossible to distinguish which checker produced which result? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Lifetime parameter leakage] Does std::any::type_name include lifetime parameters in the returned string, and if so, does split('::').last() correctly handle lifetime syntax, or could lifetime annotations leak into the checker_name field causing API response pollution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Trait object names] When called on trait objects (e.g., dyn Checker), does std::any::type_name return a deterministic name, or could dynamic dispatch cause different invocations to return different type names, breaking the consistency of checker identification across runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [JSON injection] Since CheckResult.checker_name is serialized to JSON via serde and exposed through poem_openapi, can specially crafted type names with JSON control characters (quotes, backslashes, braces) break JSON serialization or allow injection attacks in API responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [XML/HTML injection] If the node-checker API responses are ever consumed by systems that render HTML or XML, could unescaped type names containing '<', '>', or other markup characters enable cross-site scripting (XSS) or markup injection through the checker_name field? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Character encoding] Does the type name extraction preserve UTF-8 encoding correctly, or could type names with non-ASCII characters cause encoding issues when checker_name is transmitted over the API, potentially breaking API clients or causing data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [API response size] Are there any limits on the size of CheckResult.checker_name in the API schema, or could extremely long type names (from complex generics) cause API response size limits to be exceeded, resulting in failed health checks and false negative reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Checker spoofing] Can a malicious actor create a custom Checker implementation with a type name that deliberately mimics a trusted checker's name (e.g., by using similar final components), causing the spoofed checker's results to be incorrectly attributed and potentially hiding real issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Name stability] Are type names guaranteed to be stable across Rust compiler versions and compilation modes (debug vs release), or could the same Checker type produce different checker_name values in different builds, breaking result comparison and historical analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Module restructuring] If the Aptos codebase undergoes module reorganization and Checker implementations are moved to different modules, would this change the checker_name values returned by get_type_name, breaking backward compatibility with stored check results or monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Determinism] Is std::any::type_name guaranteed to be deterministic across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), or could platform-specific type name formatting cause the same Checker to have different checker_name values on different systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Concurrent access] Since get_type_name returns &'static str from std::any::type_name which is computed at compile-time, are there any race conditions or memory safety issues when multiple threads concurrently call get_type_name for the same type, or is the static lifetime guarantee sufficient? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [String allocation] Does the split('::').last() operation allocate new strings or return references to the original static string, and could high-frequency calls to get_type_name from concurrent checkers cause memory pressure or allocation overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Score aggregation attack] In CheckSummary.from(Vec<CheckResult>), the summary_score is calculated by averaging all checker scores - if an attacker can control checker_name values through type name manipulation, could they inject duplicate checker results with inflated scores to manipulate the overall summary_score and mask failing nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Result filtering] If downstream systems filter or group CheckResults by checker_name, could name collisions or manipulated type names cause legitimate check results to be incorrectly grouped, filtered out, or ignored, leading to undetected node health issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Monitoring bypass] If monitoring systems rely on specific checker_name patterns to trigger alerts, could an attacker rename or restructure Checker implementations to change their type names, bypassing alert rules and hiding critical validator failures? (High)"
