  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with deeply nested structures or excessive recursion that cause stack overflow during deserialization, leading to validator node crashes or memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [DoS via memory exhaustion] Can an attacker submit events with extremely large String fields (old_value, new_value, mutated_field_name) that consume excessive memory during BCS deserialization, causing OOM conditions on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Does BCS deserialization properly validate the struct layout, or can an attacker craft bytes that deserialize into a TokenMutation with mismatched field types, causing type confusion vulnerabilities in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow in length prefix] Can malicious BCS bytes with manipulated length prefixes for String fields cause integer overflow when calculating memory allocations, leading to buffer overflows or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Incomplete deserialization] If BCS bytes contain extra trailing data after a valid TokenMutation, does deserialization fail properly or silently ignore the extra data, potentially allowing attackers to smuggle additional malicious payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation fields] [Unbounded string length] Are there any length limits enforced on mutated_field_name, old_value, and new_value String fields, or can attackers create events with multi-gigabyte strings causing storage exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation fields] [Invalid UTF-8] Can the String fields contain invalid UTF-8 sequences that bypass validation in Move code but cause panics or undefined behavior when processed by Rust indexers or APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation fields] [Null byte injection] Can attackers inject null bytes (\\0) in the string fields to truncate field names or values in downstream C FFI boundaries or cause path traversal vulnerabilities in logging/indexing systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation fields] [Control character injection] Can control characters (newlines, tabs, ANSI escape codes) in old_value or new_value fields be exploited to inject malicious content into logs, APIs, or UIs that process these events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: mutated_field_name()] [Field name validation] Is there any validation that mutated_field_name corresponds to an actual field in the token object, or can arbitrary strings be logged as mutations, enabling event pollution attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation.token_address] [Invalid address] Can the token_address field contain addresses that don't correspond to actual token objects, allowing attackers to emit fake mutation events for non-existent tokens and corrupt indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation.token_address] [Address collision] Could hash collisions in AccountAddress creation allow attackers to emit mutation events for one token that appear to target a different token, causing state confusion in off-chain systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: token_address()] [Reference lifetime] Does returning a reference to token_address create any lifetime issues in concurrent contexts where the TokenMutation could be modified while the reference is held? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module/struct name mismatch] Does the MODULE_NAME 'token' and STRUCT_NAME 'Mutation' correctly match the on-chain Move module, or could a mismatch allow type confusion where events from different modules are incorrectly parsed as TokenMutation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Address mismatch] Is TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS always the correct address for the token module across different networks (mainnet/testnet/devnet), or could address mismatches cause events to be misrouted or ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can an attacker construct events with modified type tags that still deserialize as TokenMutation but bypass validation in the Move VM or event processing pipeline? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version confusion] Does implementing MoveEventV2Type ensure compatibility with all event processing systems, or could version mismatches cause events to be processed incorrectly or dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Concurrent mutations] If multiple TokenMutation events are emitted in the same transaction for the same token_address and mutated_field_name, is there guaranteed ordering, or could race conditions cause the wrong final state to be recorded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [State reversion] If a transaction emits TokenMutation events but then aborts, are the events properly rolled back, or could ghost events remain in the event log causing state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: old_value/new_value] [Semantic validation] Is there any validation that old_value actually matches the previous state before mutation, or can Move code emit events with arbitrary old_value causing audit trail corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: old_value/new_value] [Type encoding inconsistency] If old_value and new_value represent different types (e.g., changing from String to u64), could inconsistent string encoding cause parsing errors or type confusion in indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone cost] Since TokenMutation contains multiple String fields, could excessive cloning during event processing cause memory exhaustion or performance degradation in high-throughput scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Shallow vs deep copy] Does the derived Clone implementation properly deep-copy the String fields, or could shallow copying lead to use-after-free bugs if the original is dropped while clones exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Serialization format consistency] Are the Serde serialization format and BCS format guaranteed to be compatible, or could differences cause events to serialize correctly but fail BCS deserialization?
