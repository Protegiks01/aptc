  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Environment variable injection] Can an attacker with access to the build environment manipulate GIT_SHA, GIT_BRANCH, or GIT_TAG environment variables to inject malicious version strings that bypass security checks in downstream components like update mechanisms or peer verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Supply chain attack] Can a compromised CI/CD pipeline set malicious BUILD_DATE environment variable values that cause incorrect version ordering or timestamp validation failures in the network, potentially enabling downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Version spoofing] Can an attacker set GIT_SHA to a legitimate commit hash while deploying malicious binaries, effectively masking compromised validator nodes in peer monitoring responses and telemetry data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_git_hash()] [Commit hash spoofing] Does the GIT_SHA environment variable override mechanism allow attackers to spoof commit hashes in Docker builds, potentially bypassing version-based security policies or compatibility checks across the network? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 88-102] [Undefined behavior] Does the repeated insertion into build_information BTreeMap with the same keys (BUILD_COMMIT_HASH, BUILD_BRANCH, BUILD_TAG, BUILD_TIME) create any unexpected behavior where environment overrides fail silently or corrupt the map state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Memory exhaustion] Can extremely large environment variable values for GIT_SHA, GIT_BRANCH, GIT_TAG, or BUILD_DATE cause excessive memory allocation in the BTreeMap, potentially leading to node crashes or OOM conditions?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_profile_name()] [Platform dependency] Does the use of MAIN_SEPARATOR for path splitting create inconsistencies between Linux (/), Windows (\\\\), and other platforms, allowing attackers to craft platform-specific exploits that extract wrong profile names?
