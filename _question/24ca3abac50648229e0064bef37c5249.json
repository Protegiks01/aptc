  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/address.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Insufficient Fuzz Testing] Are all possible byte patterns and input strings fuzz-tested to ensure no unexpected panics or incorrect parsing results, or can an attacker find inputs that crash the parser? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/address.rs] [Overall Architecture] [Property-Based Testing Gap] Are properties like parse(display(addr)) == addr verified for all possible NumericalAddress values and formats, or can round-trip conversion fail for certain edge cases? (Low)"
