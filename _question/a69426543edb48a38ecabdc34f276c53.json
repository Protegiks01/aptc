  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() module compilation block] [Module size limit bypass] Is there a limit on compiled module size?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() script compilation block] [Type confusion] Can script compilation create type confusion between script arguments and module resources, potentially allowing scripts to access or modify resources they shouldn't have permission to touch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() script compilation block] [Verification bypass] Does --no-verify for scripts allow bypassing critical safety checks like signature validation, sequence number checks, or gas limit enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [Path traversal] Can write_output() be exploited to write compiled bytecode to arbitrary filesystem locations by manipulating source_path.with_extension(), potentially overwriting validator configuration files or system binaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [File overwrite] Does write_output() check if the output file already exists?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [Symlink attack] If the output path is a symlink, does write_output() follow it and potentially write to an attacker-controlled location? Could this be used to overwrite validator keystores? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [Race condition - TOCTOU] Between creating the file handle and writing data, can an attacker replace the file with a symlink, causing the write to target a different location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [Disk exhaustion] Can an attacker compile modules that produce extremely large bytecode or source map outputs (gigabytes), filling up disk space and causing validator nodes to crash or fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: write_output()] [Permission bypass] Does write_output() respect filesystem permissions? Can it be used to create files in directories where the user shouldn't have write access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Atomic write failure] If write_output() fails partway through writing bytecode, does it leave corrupted partial files that could cause validators to load invalid modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() source map block] [Information disclosure] Can malicious Move IR cause source maps to include sensitive information (private comments, internal variable names) that shouldn't be exposed in the compiled output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() source map block] [Serialization overflow] Can extremely large source maps (tracking millions of source locations) cause bcs::to_bytes() to allocate excessive memory or produce multi-gigabyte outputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() source map block] [Path injection] Do source maps store the original source_path? Can this be exploited to inject malicious paths into debugging metadata that's later used by development tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() source map block] [Deserialization attack vector] Could maliciously crafted source maps be used as an attack vector against tools that later deserialize them, potentially causing RCE in debugging or analysis tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: do_verify_module()] [Verification bypass] Does VerifierConfig::default() enable all necessary safety checks? Could attackers identify disabled checks and craft bytecode that passes verification but violates safety invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: do_verify_module()] [Dependency verification gap] Does dependencies::verify_module() properly check that all dependency modules are compatible versions?
