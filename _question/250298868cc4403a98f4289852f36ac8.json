  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] All five submodules are exposed as 'pub mod' - could this overly broad public API surface allow external attackers to directly instantiate or manipulate AssetUploaderRequestStatuses, ParsedAssetUris, or LedgerInfo structs in ways that bypass intended access controls in the parent modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Access Control] The public module declarations expose asset_uploader_request_statuses and asset_uploader_request_statuses_query - can an attacker abuse this visibility to query or modify upload request statuses for NFTs they don't own, potentially causing unauthorized CDN URI manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Exposure] By making parsed_asset_uris and parsed_asset_uris_query public, does this allow attackers to directly call database query functions like get_by_raw_image_uri() or get_by_raw_animation_uri() to enumerate all NFT metadata URIs in the system, causing privacy leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Data Integrity] The ledger_info module is exposed publicly - can an attacker with access to this module directly modify the chain_id value in the LedgerInfo struct, causing the NFT metadata crawler to process transactions from an incorrect blockchain and corrupt its database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Type Safety] All models are exposed through public modules without any trait bounds or sealed traits - can an attacker create malicious implementations of these model types that bypass validation logic when used by the crawler's processing pipeline? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Dependency Confusion] The module structure exposes internal models publicly - could this enable dependency confusion attacks where an attacker publishes a malicious crate with similar model names that get imported instead of the legitimate models? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Information Disclosure] The public module declarations reveal the internal data model structure (asset uploading, URI parsing, ledger tracking) - does this information disclosure help attackers understand the system architecture to craft targeted attacks against the NFT metadata crawler? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Namespace Pollution] All five modules are exposed at the same level without hierarchical organization - can this flat namespace structure lead to naming conflicts or allow attackers to inject malicious modules with similar names through path manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Coupling] The models module exposes both data models and query interfaces together - does this tight coupling between AssetUploaderRequestStatuses/AssetUploaderRequestStatusesQuery and ParsedAssetUris/ParsedAssetUrisQuery create attack vectors where modifying one struct affects query behavior in unexpected ways? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [API Boundary] By exposing all models publicly, this file establishes the API boundary for the NFT metadata crawler - are there missing validation layers or authorization checks that should exist at this module boundary before callers can access sensitive database models? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Version Compatibility] The public module exports have no version constraints or compatibility markers - can breaking changes to AssetUploaderRequestStatuses or ParsedAssetUris structs in submodules cause silent corruption in external code that depends on these models? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Serialization Exposure] The models are publicly exposed and likely implement Serialize/Deserialize traits - can attackers exploit this to craft malicious serialized payloads that when deserialized into these public model types cause memory corruption or logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Database Access] The public exposure of both parsed_asset_uris and parsed_asset_uris_query modules allows direct database access - can an attacker bypass rate limiting or authentication by directly calling database query functions through these public modules instead of going through the API layer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Struct Instantiation] Public modules allow external code to import and instantiate model structs - can attackers create AssetUploaderRequestStatuses or ParsedAssetUris instances with invalid state (e.g., negative retry counts, null URIs) that bypass validation when inserted into the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Organization] The separation of models and query interfaces suggests different access patterns - does the public exposure of both allow attackers to mix query results with model insertions in ways that cause race conditions or data inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Encapsulation] No private submodules exist in this module structure - does this lack of encapsulation mean all internal database schemas and query logic are exposed to potential attackers who can reverse engineer the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Trust Boundary] This mod.rs file defines the trust boundary between the NFT metadata crawler and external callers - are the exposed models sufficiently hardened against malicious inputs, or do they assume trusted callers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Re-exports] All modules are simple pub mod declarations without re-exports - does this mean callers must know the exact submodule paths, or could this lead to incorrect imports that bypass security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Atomic Operations] The models module exposes separate data and query interfaces - can race conditions occur when an attacker simultaneously creates ParsedAssetUris entries while querying via ParsedAssetUrisQuery, causing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Schema Evolution] Public model exposure locks the database schema into the public API - can attackers exploit this rigidity by forcing the system to maintain vulnerable legacy code paths in AssetUploaderRequestStatuses or ParsedAssetUris for backward compatibility? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Composite Primary Keys] The exposed models likely use composite primary keys (idempotency_key, application_id, asset_uri) - does public exposure allow attackers to craft key collisions or exploit weaknesses in composite key validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Error Propagation] Public module boundaries can affect error handling - do errors from ParsedAssetUrisQuery or AssetUploaderRequestStatusesQuery leak sensitive information about database state, query patterns, or system internals to attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Idempotency] The asset_uploader_request_statuses module suggests idempotency handling - does public exposure of this model allow attackers to replay requests with manipulated idempotency keys to bypass deduplication and cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Query Injection] Public query modules (asset_uploader_request_statuses_query, parsed_asset_uris_query) expose database query interfaces - can attackers craft malicious queries through these public interfaces that cause SQL injection, DoS via expensive queries, or unauthorized data access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [State Consistency] The module exposes both mutable models (for insertion) and immutable query interfaces - can attackers exploit this separation to create inconsistent states where AssetUploaderRequestStatuses insertions don't immediately reflect in AssetUploaderRequestStatusesQuery results? (Medium)"
