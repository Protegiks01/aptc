  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Struct: ConfigID] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft two different on-chain configs with identical ConfigID tuples but different semantic meanings, causing validators to apply wrong configurations and potentially breaking consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Struct: ConfigID] [Injection attack] Does the ConfigID Display implementation properly sanitize the address and identifier strings, or can malicious configs inject format string specifiers that could leak memory or cause crashes during logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: ConfigID::name()] [Data integrity] Can the name() method return inconsistent results if the underlying static str is corrupted, leading to config mismatches across validators and potential network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfigProvider] [Type safety] Does the generic get<T: OnChainConfig>() method enforce type consistency, or can an attacker request a config with wrong type T causing deserialization to succeed with corrupted data leading to protocol violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfigProvider] [Concurrency] Are implementations of OnChainConfigProvider thread-safe when called concurrently during epoch transitions, or can race conditions cause validators to read inconsistent config snapshots leading to consensus divergence?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: InMemoryOnChainConfig::new()] [Validation bypass] Does the constructor validate that all configs in the HashMap are properly formed, or can malformed configs be inserted that later cause deserialization panics when fetched? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: InMemoryOnChainConfig::get()] [Error handling] If the config is missing from the HashMap, does the error message leak sensitive information about internal state that could be exploited for reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Struct: InMemoryOnChainConfig] [Clone behavior] Does the Clone implementation perform deep copying of the HashMap, or can cloned instances share mutable state causing validators to see inconsistent configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Struct: OnChainConfigPayload] [Epoch manipulation] Can the epoch field overflow if incremented without bounds during long-running chains, causing epoch comparisons to wrap around and violate reconfiguration ordering guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: OnChainConfigPayload::new()] [Arc safety] Does wrapping the provider in Arc introduce potential race conditions if the provider's internal state is mutated, allowing concurrent reads during config updates to see torn values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: OnChainConfigPayload::epoch()] [Information disclosure] Can attackers correlate epoch numbers with validator performance to predict validator selection and launch targeted attacks during specific epochs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Function: OnChainConfigPayload::get()] [Type confusion] Does this method properly validate that T matches the expected config type for the current epoch, or can mismatched types cause silent data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Struct: OnChainConfigPayload] [Memory leak] Does the Arc<P> reference counting mechanism properly release provider resources, or can circular references cause memory leaks in long-running validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: ConfigStorage] [State key validation] Does fetch_config_bytes() validate that the StateKey corresponds to a legitimate config address, or can attackers query arbitrary state keys to extract sensitive system state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: ConfigStorage] [Null handling] If fetch_config_bytes() returns None for missing configs, how do callers distinguish between legitimately absent configs vs. storage errors, potentially causing incorrect fallback behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: ConfigStorage] [Bytes integrity] Are the returned Bytes immutable, or can modifications propagate back to storage causing config corruption across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/mod.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Address validation] Does the const ADDRESS always resolve to 0x1, or can custom implementations override it to point to attacker-controlled addresses for config injection attacks? (Critical)",
