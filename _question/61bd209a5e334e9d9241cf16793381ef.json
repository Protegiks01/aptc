  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [HashMap collision] Even though MessageType implements Hash and Eq, can hash collisions cause legitimate handlers to be rejected or overwritten? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Reference lifetime] Does getting a reference to the handler from the HashMap (line 68) create lifetime issues if the handler is removed while holding the reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: new()] [Clone semantics] Since service is cloned on line 27, can modifications to the original service string affect the InboundHandler instance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Oneshot reliability] Can the oneshot channel returned by start() be lost or dropped without being used, causing the server to never shutdown properly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Memory safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or FFI calls in the call chain that could introduce memory safety issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Lock ordering] Can inconsistent lock ordering between inbound_handlers Mutex here and other mutexes in the system cause deadlocks during validator operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Runtime shutdown] If the Runtime passed to start() is dropped while the server is running, can this cause undefined behavior or resource leaks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Struct: InboundHandler] [Send/Sync bounds] Are all fields properly Send+Sync to allow safe concurrent access, or can incorrect bounds lead to data races? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Self-message loop] When used for 'self messages' as mentioned in the comment (line 65), can message routing create infinite loops or recursive calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Message lifetime] Does the Message struct own its data or contain references that could become invalid during asynchronous processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Handler replacement] Is there an API to safely replace or update handlers, or must the system restart to change handler mappings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Registration verification] After registering a handler, is there a way to verify it was successful, or does the assertion failure on duplicate registration provide the only feedback? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [HashMap performance] As the number of registered handlers grows, does HashMap lookup performance degrade, causing latency in message routing that could miss consensus deadlines? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Struct: InboundHandler] [Mutex granularity] Could using a more granular locking strategy (e.g., per-handler locks or lock-free structures) improve throughput under high message load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Handler contract] What guarantees does the system make about handler behavior (e.g., non-blocking, error handling), and can violating these cause cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Network configuration] Does the gRPC server respect firewall rules, rate limits, or other network policies configured at the OS level, or can it bypass security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [MessageType validation] Since MessageType wraps an unvalidated String, can attackers use this to inject malicious data into metrics, logs, or traces that later get parsed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Sender validation] Is the Sender<Message> validated to ensure it's connected to a legitimate handler, or can attackers register dummy channels that discard messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: send_incoming_message_to_handler()] [Logging security] Does the warning log on line 72 include sensitive information (message content, sender details) that could leak to unauthorized parties if logs are compromised? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Struct: InboundHandler] [Metrics exposure] Are metrics about handler registration and message routing exposed in a way that could leak validator configuration to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/inbound_handler.rs] [Function: register_handler()] [Type inference] Can type inference ambiguities in MessageType::new() or HashMap operations cause unexpected behavior or compilation issues in edge cases? (Low)",
