  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod config] [Access Control] Are the submodules (config, metrics, service) using appropriate visibility modifiers, or could private implementation details be accidentally exposed through the module hierarchy, allowing unauthorized access to internal APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod service] [Information Disclosure] Does the service module properly encapsulate sensitive functionality, or could module-level re-exports inadvertently expose internal RawDataServerWrapper implementation details to external crates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod metrics] [Information Disclosure] Are metrics collection mechanisms properly isolated within the metrics module, or could metric data exposure through improper module boundaries leak sensitive operational information about the indexer service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: pub use config] [API Surface Attack] The pub use statement selectively re-exports IndexerGrpcDataServiceConfig, NonTlsConfig, and SERVER_NAME - could this selective exposure pattern hide security-critical configuration validation that should be visible to external auditors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: pub use config] [Configuration Tampering] Does re-exporting SERVER_NAME as a public constant create opportunities for name collision attacks if malicious crates shadow this identifier, potentially causing misrouting of indexer requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] [Supply Chain Attack] If a malicious actor compromises the config, metrics, or service submodules, could they inject backdoors that would pass through this minimal lib.rs without detection due to lack of explicit security checks at the crate boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod service] [Privilege Escalation] Does the service module contain unsafe code or FFI boundaries that should be explicitly documented or restricted at the crate level to prevent unsafe operations from being called by external crates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module Organization] [Code Injection] Could the module declaration pattern allow for module substitution attacks during compilation if the build system is compromised, replacing the legitimate service.rs with malicious code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: IndexerGrpcDataServiceConfig] [Configuration Validation] Does re-exporting the configuration struct without intermediate validation wrappers mean that external crates could construct invalid configurations that bypass security checks implemented within the config module? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: NonTlsConfig] [TLS Bypass] The explicit re-export of NonTlsConfig suggests the service can run without TLS - is this a security risk for production deployments where attackers could intercept unencrypted blockchain indexer data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] [Dependency Confusion] Are there implicit dependencies between the config, metrics, and service modules that could be exploited through dependency confusion attacks if module load order is manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/lib.rs] [Crate Root] [Missing Security Attributes] Does the crate lack security-critical attributes at the root level (e.g., #![forbid(unsafe_code)], #![deny(warnings)]) that could prevent introduction of unsafe operations in submodules? (Low)"
