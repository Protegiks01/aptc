  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Resource cleanup] If table construction fails, are all allocated resources (vectors, HashMap) properly cleaned up, or can memory leaks accumulate across repeated DKG attempts, eventually exhausting validator memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Trait bounds] The CurveGroup trait is used without additional security-specific bounds. Can an attacker implement a malicious CurveGroup that appears valid but contains backdoors enabling discrete log computation or key recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Type confusion] If different CurveGroup implementations are mixed in a multi-curve DKG setup, can type confusion cause tables built for one curve to be used with another, enabling cross-curve attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Generic instantiation] Are there any unsafe instantiations of the generic function where C is bound to a curve with known weaknesses (e.g., NIST P-curves with potential backdoors or small embedding degree)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Lookup validation] When the returned table is used for discrete log lookups, does the caller validate that the compressed point exists in the table before using the returned exponent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Missing entries] If a discrete log lookup queries a point not in the table (j >= table_size), does the DKG protocol handle the None return value correctly, or can this cause panics or incorrect share computations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Exponent range] The table returns exponents as u32. If downstream DKG code expects smaller ranges or specific modular arithmetic, can u32::MAX exponents cause overflow in subsequent computations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Determinism guarantee] If different validators build tables with the same parameters (G, table_size), is the resulting HashMap guaranteed to be identical across all nodes, or can implementation details cause divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build()] [Configuration sync] If table_size is configured per-validator rather than consensus parameter, can validators build incompatible tables causing DKG protocol to fail during share reconstruction or threshold operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/table.rs] [Function: build_default()] [Generator consistency] Does C::generator() return identical points across different validator implementations, operating systems, and arkworks library versions, or can generator divergence break DKG interoperability? (High)"
