  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Secrets exposure] Are the cloudflare_auth_key and cloudflare_account_id properly protected from being logged or exposed in error messages when Debug trait is derived, potentially leaking credentials to logs or monitoring systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Secrets exposure] Does the Clone trait derivation allow sensitive Cloudflare credentials to be duplicated in memory without proper zeroization, potentially leaving credentials in memory even after the original struct is dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_auth_key] [Credential validation] Is the cloudflare_auth_key validated for proper format and length, or can malformed/empty keys be accepted that would cause authentication failures or unexpected behavior in the uploader worker? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_id] [Credential validation] Is the cloudflare_account_id validated to ensure it matches expected format (UUID/alphanumeric), or can arbitrary strings be injected that might cause API abuse or account confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Memory safety] Are the String fields for credentials properly sanitized before use, or could they contain null bytes or control characters that might cause issues in downstream Cloudflare API calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Configuration injection] While deny_unknown_fields prevents extra fields, can an attacker provide maliciously large strings for cloudflare_auth_key or cloudflare_account_id during deserialization, causing memory exhaustion or buffer-related issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Deserialization attack] Can specially crafted JSON/YAML configuration files exploit serde deserialization to inject malicious data into the credential fields, bypassing validation or causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Configuration tampering] Does deny_unknown_fields adequately prevent configuration injection attacks, or are there edge cases where additional fields could be smuggled in through nested structures or encoding tricks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Unauthorized access] Where is this configuration loaded from, and are file permissions properly restricted to prevent unauthorized users from reading the Cloudflare credentials from the configuration file? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Configuration tampering] Is the configuration file integrity verified (e.g., via checksums or signatures) before loading, or can an attacker with write access modify the Cloudflare credentials to redirect assets to their own account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Environment variable injection] If these credentials are loaded from environment variables, are they properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or exposure through process listings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Trait: Debug] [Information disclosure] Does the derived Debug implementation expose raw credential values when the struct is printed, logged, or included in error messages, potentially leaking sensitive Cloudflare API keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Data leakage] Can the Serialize trait be exploited to export the configuration (including credentials) to untrusted outputs, logs, or monitoring systems where attackers could harvest Cloudflare API keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Credential rotation] Is there a mechanism to rotate the cloudflare_auth_key, or once compromised, would the key remain valid indefinitely, allowing prolonged unauthorized access to Cloudflare account? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Race condition] If multiple worker threads clone this configuration, can concurrent modifications or access to the underlying credential strings cause race conditions or use-after-free issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Concurrent access] If this config is wrapped in Arc<Mutex<>> or similar for thread-safe access, are there potential deadlocks or race conditions when multiple workers try to access the Cloudflare credentials simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_auth_key] [Injection attack] Are there validation checks to ensure the cloudflare_auth_key doesn't contain special characters or escape sequences that could be exploited in HTTP headers when making Cloudflare API requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_account_id] [Injection attack] Could the cloudflare_account_id contain path traversal characters (../, .//) or URL-encoded payloads that might be exploited when constructing Cloudflare API endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [String length validation] Are there maximum length constraints on the String fields to prevent denial-of-service through extremely long credential strings that could cause memory or performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Missing validation] Does the struct implement any validation methods to ensure both cloudflare_auth_key and cloudflare_account_id are non-empty and properly formatted before use, preventing runtime errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Default values] Can this configuration be instantiated with default/empty values, potentially causing the worker to operate with invalid credentials or fail silently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Strict parsing] While deny_unknown_fields enforces strict field matching, does it prevent missing required fields, or can the config be deserialized with empty/null credentials? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field: cloudflare_auth_key] [Encoding vulnerability] Are the credential strings properly encoded (UTF-8) and validated to prevent encoding-based attacks or mojibake issues when transmitted to Cloudflare APIs?
