  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker craft a custom error type without a source that mimics framework errors to bypass error conversion, potentially leaking sensitive internal error details that should be sanitized by build_error_response()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Logic bypass] Does the has_source() check at line 17 reliably distinguish between framework and application errors, or can an attacker create AptosTapError instances with a source field to force them through the framework error path and manipulate status codes arbitrarily? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/error_converter.rs] [Function: convert_error()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the error downcasting logic by providing errors that have sources but are actually malicious AptosTapError variants, causing them to be processed incorrectly and bypass security checks?
