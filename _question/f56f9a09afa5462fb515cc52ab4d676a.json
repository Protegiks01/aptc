  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_version_and_index()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide u64::MAX for the index parameter to cause integer overflow when accessing the database schema key (version, index), potentially reading unintended memory locations or causing a panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_version_and_index()] [Database inconsistency] If the database returns None for a valid (version, index) pair that should exist based on transaction execution, does this indicate database corruption that could lead to state inconsistency across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_version_and_index()] [Denial of service] Can a malicious validator repeatedly query non-existent event indices to exhaust database resources and degrade node performance, affecting consensus participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_version_and_index()] [Error message leakage] Does the error message format 'Event {} of Txn {}' leak sensitive information about database state that could help attackers fingerprint node versions or internal structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_version_and_index()] [Version validation] Is there any validation that the version parameter corresponds to a committed transaction version, or can attackers query future/non-existent versions to probe for race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_txn_ver_by_seq_num()] [Sequence number manipulation] Can an attacker craft a malicious event_key that doesn't exist but causes the database lookup to return a valid (ver, _) tuple from a different event stream, leading to cross-stream event confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_txn_ver_by_seq_num()] [EventByKeySchema integrity] If EventByKeySchema returns a tuple (ver, index) but the corresponding event doesn't exist in EventSchema, can this cause state inconsistency or incorrect event retrieval? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_txn_ver_by_seq_num()] [Index corruption] The function discards the index value from the tuple - can this lead to scenarios where callers assume index 0 but the actual event is at a different index, causing event misidentification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_txn_ver_by_seq_num()] [Database schema mismatch] What happens if EventByKeySchema and EventSchema become desynchronized (one has an entry but the other doesn't) - can this lead to permanent event retrieval failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_txn_ver_by_seq_num()] [Sequence number gaps] Does this function verify that seq_num is within valid bounds for the event_key, or can attackers query arbitrarily large sequence numbers to probe database state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_key()] [Ledger version bypass] Can an attacker provide a ledger_version that is greater than the actual committed ledger version to access events that haven't been properly validated or finalized by consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_key()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Is there a race condition between lookup_event_by_key checking the ledger_version and get_event_by_version_and_index retrieving the event, where the event could be pruned in between? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_key()] [Return value mismatch] If lookup_event_by_key succeeds but get_event_by_version_and_index fails, does the error handling properly propagate the issue or could it return a misleading error about event_key/seq_num?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_event_by_key()] [Pruning race] Can events be pruned after lookup_event_by_key finds the (version, index) but before get_event_by_version_and_index retrieves the actual event, causing inconsistent query results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Iterator manipulation] Does seek_for_prev with u64::MAX as the sequence number safely handle overflow conditions, or could it skip to unintended positions in the database iterator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Event key confusion] The function checks if key == event_key after iteration - can an attacker craft event keys with similar prefixes to cause false positives and return sequence numbers from wrong event streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Ledger version validation] Is ledger_version properly validated to be within committed range, or can future versions be queried to probe uncommitted event state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Iterator exhaustion] What happens if the iterator returns multiple events at the same version with different sequence numbers - does next() guarantee returning the highest sequence number? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Empty result handling] When returning None, is the caller properly handling the case where an event stream has never had any events vs. being pruned vs. not existing yet? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_latest_sequence_number()] [Version boundary] If ledger_version is 0, does seek_for_prev handle this edge case correctly or could it underflow and access invalid database positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_next_sequence_number()] [Integer overflow] The checked_add(1) prevents overflow, but what happens to event emission when sequence numbers reach u64::MAX - does this permanently break the event stream causing loss of event data?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/event_store/mod.rs] [Function: get_next_sequence_number()] [Default value] When get_latest_sequence_number returns None, this function returns 0 - is this safe for all event streams or could attackers exploit reused sequence numbers after pruning? (Medium)",
