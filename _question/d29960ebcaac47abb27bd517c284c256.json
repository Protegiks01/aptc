  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_stack_trace()] [Testing Feature Scope] Are there runtime checks beyond the compile-time cfg! macro to prevent native_stack_trace() from being called in production, or is the entire security model based on build-time configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Native Function Registration] Does the registration of debug natives in make_all() on lines 114-122 have access controls, or can malicious code register these functions even when they should be disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_old_debug_print()] [Legacy Function Security] Why are legacy functions like native_old_debug_print() kept for 're-playability on-chain' as stated in the comment on line 118 - does this mean old transactions with debug calls can still execute in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_old_debug_print()] [Type Arguments Indexing] Line 85 accesses ty_args[0] without bounds checking - can an attacker call this function with zero type arguments causing an index out of bounds panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_print()] [SmallVec Return] All functions return Ok(smallvec![]) or similar - what happens if the Move VM expects different return arity or types, can this cause VM crashes? (Medium)",
