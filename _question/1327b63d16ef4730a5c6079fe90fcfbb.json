  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Delayed Field] [Partial Replacement] If replace_identifiers_with_values (line 290) only replaces some IDs but not others, can partial replacement cause resources with mixed resolved and unresolved IDs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Delayed Field] [Exchange Format Exploit] Can attackers craft values that claim to be in 'Exchanged' format but actually contain invalid data, bypassing validation in the resource_writes_to_materialize! macro? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Delayed Field] [ID Reuse Attack] Can delayed field IDs generated by gen_id_start_value be reused across epochs or validator restarts, causing ID collision when old IDs are referenced by new transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/executor_utilities.rs] [Fail Point] [Production Trigger] Can the fail_point macro on lines 130-134 be accidentally enabled in production builds, allowing attackers to trigger artificial failures by crafting specific transaction patterns? (High)"
