  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Compatibility] [Migration] During feature migration (e.g., signature v1 to v2), are there inconsistencies that can be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Test function exposure] Is verify_module_with_config_for_test actually restricted to test builds, or can it be called in production with relaxed checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Debug features] Are there debug-only features in any public modules that could be exploited in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Specification completeness] Are all security-critical invariants of the verification pipeline documented, or could missing specs lead to incorrect usage? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [API misuse] Could the public API be misused by external callers in ways that bypass security guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Bounds expectations] Are the expected invariants for BoundsChecker clearly specified for subsequent verification phases? (Low)"
