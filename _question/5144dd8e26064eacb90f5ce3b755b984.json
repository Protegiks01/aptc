  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Module: source_coverage] If the source_coverage module contains bugs in location mapping, can it cause summary_func to return incorrect (total, covered) tuples that produce misleading coverage percentages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Module: summary] Can the ModuleSummary type from the summary module be manipulated to return covered > total, causing negative percentages or arithmetic errors in the coverage calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Boundary condition] When total_instructions equals 1 and total_covered equals 0, does the 0% coverage output correctly, or can floating-point errors produce small non-zero values? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Maximum values] Can u64::MAX values for total_instructions or total_covered cause the f64 conversion to overflow to infinity, producing infinite coverage percentages in the output? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Empty module] If a CompiledModule contains no functions or only native functions, does summarize_csv produce empty or zero-count CSV rows that could be misinterpreted as missing data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Memory usage] Can processing an extremely large modules slice (millions of modules) cause excessive memory allocation in the iteration loop, leading to OOM crashes in resource-constrained environments? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Resource leak] If writeln! fails mid-iteration in line 39 and causes an early return via unwrap(), are there any resources from partially processed modules that fail to clean up? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [File handle leaks] If the summary_writer wraps a file handle and format_csv_summary panics, does the caller properly close the file, or can this cause file descriptor leaks in long-running processes? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Non-deterministic output] If the modules slice ordering changes between runs, does the total coverage percentage remain identical, or can floating-point accumulation order affect the result? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Reproducible builds] Can the CSV output ordering vary based on internal BTreeMap iteration in the summary module, causing flaky test failures when coverage reports are compared byte-for-byte? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Invalid parameters] If summarize_functions is true but the summary_func doesn't support function-level details, can this cause panics or incorrect output in the coverage report? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Null-like values] Can passing an empty modules slice with a coverage_map containing data for those modules cause inconsistencies where coverage data exists but isn't reported? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Error swallowing] The .unwrap() calls swallow error information - can this make debugging difficult when coverage generation fails due to filesystem issues, permissions, or resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_csv_summary()] [Silent failures] If summarize_csv silently succeeds but produces malformed CSV data, can this cause downstream pipeline failures that are difficult to trace back to this function? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/lib.rs] [Function: format_human_summary()] [Format versioning] The output format has no version header - if the format changes in future versions, can old coverage parsers break when processing new output, causing CI/CD failures? (Low)"
