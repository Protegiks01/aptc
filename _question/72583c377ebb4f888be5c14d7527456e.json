  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: get_epoch_ending_ledger_info_iter] [Iterator Safety] Can requesting a very large epoch range cause the database iterator to hold locks for extended periods, blocking other consensus-critical database operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: latest_epoch calculation] [Race Condition] Is latest_epoch = next_block_epoch() atomic with the subsequent check? Can the latest ledger info change between reading and validation, causing TOCTOU bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: ledger_info collection] [Memory Exhaustion] Does collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>() on line 1044 bound the vector size, or can requesting 1M epochs allocate unbounded memory causing OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: DB corruption check] [Incomplete Validation] The check at line 1046-1049 ensures count matches, but does it validate ledger info sequence/integrity? Can gaps in epoch history pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Signature Validation] Does the EpochChangeProof response include signatures for all epoch-ending ledger infos? Can requesting epochs with forged signatures cause validators to accept invalid epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Quorum Verification] Are the quorum certificates in epoch-ending ledger infos verified against the validator set of the epoch they claim to end? Can mismatched validator sets enable forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Hash Chain Integrity] Does the response validate that the hash chain of epoch-ending ledger infos is unbroken from start_epoch to end_epoch, or can gaps allow chain-splitting attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [BLS Aggregation] If epoch proofs use BLS signature aggregation, can requesting epochs that include partially signed or threshold signatures reveal individual validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [VRF Randomness] Can requesting epoch ranges that include VRF-based validator elections expose patterns in randomness generation that could be exploited for leader election manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Concurrent Requests] Can multiple threads simultaneously process EpochRetrievalRequests for overlapping epoch ranges, causing database lock contention and consensus slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Async Safety] Since epoch_manager uses async/await, can processing EpochRetrievalRequest be interrupted mid-execution, leaving partially loaded epoch state that corrupts subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Mutex Poisoning] If the database mutex is poisoned during epoch proof retrieval due to a panic, can subsequent EpochRetrievalRequests deadlock the entire consensus system? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Channel Overflow] Can flooding EpochRetrievalRequests faster than they can be processed cause the message channel to overflow, dropping critical consensus messages like votes or proposals? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Memory Ordering] Are epoch values read with proper memory ordering guarantees? Can relaxed atomics cause validators to see inconsistent start_epoch/end_epoch values due to reordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Gas Economics] Are there gas costs or rate limits on sending EpochRetrievalRequests? Can validators abuse free epoch sync to avoid honest participation costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Stake Grinding] Can requesting epoch ranges to learn historical validator sets enable stake-grinding attacks where malicious validators predict future validator set compositions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [MEV Extraction] Can requesting future epoch transitions (if available) reveal information about upcoming stake changes that could be exploited for MEV or governance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Slashing Evasion] Can a validator about to be slashed flood the network with EpochRetrievalRequests to delay epoch transition, allowing them to withdraw stake before penalties apply? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Censorship] Can a Byzantine validator selectively respond to EpochRetrievalRequests to censor certain peers, preventing them from syncing and participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Pruning Conflict] If the database has pruned epochs older than start_epoch, does get_epoch_ending_ledger_infos return an error, or can it return partial/incorrect proofs that cause state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Snapshot Inconsistency] Can requesting epochs that span across a state snapshot boundary cause validators to load epoch proofs from inconsistent database snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Reconfiguration Race] Can sending EpochRetrievalRequest during active reconfiguration cause process_epoch_retrieval to read half-committed epoch state from the database? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Validator Rotation] Can requesting epochs during validator set rotation cause confusion about which validator set should sign the response, potentially allowing unauthorized nodes to respond? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Backward Compatibility] If the epoch proof format changes across versions, can requesting old epochs cause deserialization failures or backward compatibility bugs that halt consensus? (Medium)"
