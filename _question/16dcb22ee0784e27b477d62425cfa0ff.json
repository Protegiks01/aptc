  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Phase ownership leak] If PipelinePhase instances are dropped without calling start(), do their internal channels get properly cleaned up or can they leak resources? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [BufferManager multiple start] Can BufferManager be started multiple times if the calling code doesn't enforce single-start, causing duplicate processing of the same blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Counter manipulation] Can the ongoing_tasks counter be manipulated by creating CountedRequests directly without going through BufferManager, causing incorrect task counting and premature reset? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Guard lifetime mismatch] If TaskGuard in CountedRequest is dropped before the actual request processing completes, can ongoing_tasks decrement prematurely allowing reset while work is still active? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Spawn chain attack] Can an attacker use CountedRequest.spawn() to create deeply nested request chains that artificially inflate ongoing_tasks and prevent pipeline reset? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Sender-receiver mismatch] If commit_msg_tx and commit_msg_rx are from different network instances or epochs, can messages be lost or routed incorrectly causing commit vote loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Network sender clone race] Since commit_msg_tx is cloned for both PersistingPhase and BufferManager, can race conditions cause duplicate commit messages to be broadcast confusing peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Receiver stealing] If commit_msg_rx is shared or cloned before being passed to BufferManager, can another component steal messages preventing BufferManager from receiving commit votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Block ordering attack] Can OrderedBlocks in block_rx arrive out-of-order due to network delays, causing BufferManager to process blocks in wrong sequence and violate consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Sync injection] Can a malicious component inject ResetRequest into sync_rx without proper authorization, forcing BufferManager to reset and lose uncommitted work? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Block duplication] If the same OrderedBlocks are sent multiple times through block_rx, does BufferManager detect and reject duplicates, or can it double-process blocks causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Sync reset race] If multiple ResetRequests arrive concurrently in sync_rx, can they cause BufferManager to reset multiple times leading to corrupted state or panics? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Reset propagation delay] When reset_flag is set, is there a guaranteed order in which phases observe it, or can ExecutionWaitPhase continue processing while SigningPhase has already stopped? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Reset without cleanup] If reset_flag is set but phases don't properly clean up their state, can stale data from previous runs leak into the next epoch causing Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Reset flag visibility] Does reset_flag use proper memory ordering (SeqCst), or can weaker ordering cause phases on different cores to observe stale values and continue processing after reset? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [False reset] Can reset_flag be accidentally set to true due to memory corruption or unsafe code elsewhere, causing spurious resets that halt consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/decoupled_execution_utils.rs] [Function: prepare_phases_and_buffer_manager()] [Processor swap] Since processors are Box<T>, can the boxed implementations be swapped out or replaced with malicious implementations after pipeline initialization? (High)",
