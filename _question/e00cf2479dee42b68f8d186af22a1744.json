  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Supply Chain Attack] If the .coverage_map.mvcov file is downloaded from an external source or CI system, can an attacker perform a supply chain attack by replacing it with malicious coverage data that causes the tool to execute code or leak information during analysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Build System Poisoning] Can malicious coverage data cause the build system to mark dangerous code as well-tested, leading to automatic deployment of vulnerable code through CI/CD pipelines that check coverage thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Coverage Map Race Condition] If a test run is still writing to .coverage_map.mvcov while compile_coverage() tries to read it, can this cause partial reads, data corruption, or TOCTOU vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [CSV Formula Injection] When output_csv is true, can module names or function names containing Excel formula syntax (=SUM(), =HYPERLINK(), etc.) in the CSV output execute arbitrary code when opened in vulnerable spreadsheet applications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Terminal Escape Injection] Can source code comments or string literals in Move code contain ANSI escape sequences that, when displayed with color annotations, execute terminal emulator commands or hide malicious code in the coverage output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Cross-Package Contamination] If multiple packages share the same build directory or output_dir, can coverage data from one package contaminate another package's coverage analysis, leading to incorrect security assessments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Symbolic Execution Confusion] Can coverage data be manipulated to hide the fact that certain code paths are only reachable through specific symbolic conditions, making vulnerabilities appear unreachable when they are actually exploitable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Empty Package Handling] If the package path points to an empty or invalid package directory, does compile_package() handle this gracefully, or can it trigger panics, infinite loops, or resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Zero Coverage Modules] If all modules have zero coverage, can this cause division-by-zero errors when calculating coverage percentages in format_human_summary() or format_csv_summary()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SourceCoverage::execute()] [Missing Source Files] If source_path at line 121 points to a file that was deleted after compilation, does compute_source_coverage() handle the missing file error correctly, or can it cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: BytecodeCoverage::execute()] [Module Not Found] If module_name doesn't exist in the package, does get_module_by_name_from_root() at line 161 return a clear error, or can it cause confusion with similarly-named modules from dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Locale-Specific Issues] Can locale-specific string comparisons in the filter matching at line 49 cause inconsistent behavior across different system locales, potentially exposing or hiding modules unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Path Length Limits] Can extremely long package paths, module names, or file paths exceed operating system limits, causing truncation, errors, or security vulnerabilities in path handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Global] [Unicode Filename Handling] Can module names or file paths containing Unicode characters, zero-width characters, or right-to-left override characters cause display confusion or path traversal vulnerabilities? (Medium)"
