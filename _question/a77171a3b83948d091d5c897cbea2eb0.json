  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Missing Error Types] [Configuration Errors] Are consensus configuration errors (invalid parameters, incompatible settings) properly handled, or can they cause runtime failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Missing Error Types] [Resource Exhaustion] Are resource exhaustion errors (memory, disk, CPU) properly categorized, or are they hidden as InternalError causing undiagnosed performance issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Missing Error Types] [Epoch Change Errors] Are epoch transition specific errors properly represented, or can they be confused with other consensus errors causing fork at epoch boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Line 8-13] [Macro Security] Does the thiserror::Error derive on DbError generate secure error handling code, or can the #[error(transparent)] attribute create unexpected error message leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [All #[error(transparent)]] [Transparency Risk] Does the transparent error attribute expose internal implementation details through error messages that could aid attackers in understanding consensus internals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [All #[from] Attributes] [Conversion Safety] Are all #[from] attribute conversions safe and cannot panic, or can malformed errors cause panics during conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Test Module] [Fuzzing] Are error conversion paths fuzz-tested to ensure malformed errors cannot cause panics or incorrect categorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Test Module] [Error Chain Depth] Are deeply nested error chains (10+ levels) tested to ensure downcast operations work correctly at all depths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Test Module] [All Error Variants] Are all error variants from pipeline::errors, ExecutorError, AptosDbError, and SafetyRules::Error tested for proper conversion and categorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Test Module] [Concurrent Error Handling] Are there stress tests that verify error handling under high concurrency with hundreds of concurrent consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [Test Module] [Error Serialization] Are error types tested for serialization/deserialization to ensure network transmission preserves error semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [DbError + SafetyRules] [Persistent Safety Data] Can DbError during safety rules storage operations cause loss of persistent voting data, allowing validators to double-sign after restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [StateSyncError + Execution] [Non-determinism Detection] Can StateSyncError mask non-deterministic execution where validators get different ExecutorError for identical blocks, breaking state consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [QuorumStoreError + BFT] [Quorum Formation] Can QuorumStoreError prevent proper quorum formation by hiding valid signatures, breaking the 2f+1 signature threshold required for BFT safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [VerifyError + Byzantine] [Equivocation Detection] Can VerifyError prevent detection of validator equivocation (double-signing), allowing Byzantine validators to violate safety rules without penalty? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [MempoolError + Transaction Ordering] [Non-deterministic Ordering] Can MempoolError cause different validators to order transactions differently in their proposals, leading to proposal rejection and liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [error_kind + Metrics] [Security Monitoring] Can incorrect error categorization cause security-relevant events (Byzantine behavior, safety violations) to be missed by security monitoring systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [All Errors + Async] [Async Cancellation] Can errors be lost or corrupted when async consensus tasks are cancelled, leaving the system in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/error.rs] [All Errors + Panic Unwinding] [Panic Safety] If a panic occurs during error handling, is the consensus state properly recovered, or can partial error handling leave validators in corrupted states? (High)"
