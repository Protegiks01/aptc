  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_metadata()] [Input validation] Can an attacker provide a malicious package_name string with path traversal characters (../, ./, etc.) to access unauthorized package metadata from the PrebuiltPackagesBundle, potentially leaking sensitive configuration data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_metadata()] [Panic vulnerability] Does package_metadata() handle the case where get_package() returns None for a non-existent package name, or will it panic and cause denial of service in transaction generation infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_metadata()] [Memory exhaustion] If package_metadata is cloned without size limits, can an attacker trigger repeated calls with massive metadata objects to exhaust memory in the transaction generator service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_metadata()] [Type confusion] Can the returned PackageMetadata be manipulated to contain invalid upgrade policies or dependencies that bypass Move bytecode verification when published on-chain? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Panic on deserialization] At line 43, the expect() call assumes modules always deserialize successfully - can an attacker inject corrupted bytecode into the prebuilt bundle causing a panic that crashes the transaction generator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Version mismatch attack] Lines 37-45 use VERSION_DEFAULT first, then VERSION_MAX on failure - can this version fallback be exploited to force execution of modules with incompatible binary formats causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Binary format manipulation] Can an attacker craft bytecode that only validates under VERSION_MAX (line 44) but contains instructions that violate safety rules when executed in the current VM version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Resource exhaustion] If package_modules() is called repeatedly with large packages, does the Vec<(String, CompiledModule, u32)> allocation at line 32 have size limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Identifier size bypass] The DeserializerConfig at line 33 uses IDENTIFIER_SIZE_MAX - can an attacker craft modules with identifiers at exactly this limit to bypass downstream validation that assumes smaller identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_modules()] [Module name collision] Does the loop at lines 36-47 check for duplicate module names in the results vector, or can an attacker inject multiple modules with the same name causing unpredictable behavior during publishing?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_script()] [Assertion bypass] The assert at lines 54-57 checks scripts.len() <= 1, but can an attacker modify the PrebuiltPackagesBundle to contain exactly 1 script that gets replaced dynamically, bypassing the single-script restriction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_script()] [Panic on deserialization] Line 61 uses expect() for script deserialization - can malformed script bytecode in the prebuilt bundle cause a panic and denial of service in the transaction generation pipeline?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Function: package_script()] [Optional script confusion] Since package_script returns Option<CompiledScript>, can consumers incorrectly assume a script exists and unwrap() None, causing panics in production transaction generators?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/entry_point_trait.rs] [Enum: MultiSigConfig] [Logic error] If MultiSigConfig::Random(0) is used, does the downstream code properly handle zero additional signers, or will it cause division by zero or empty signature validation?
