  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide entry_points with weights that sum to usize::MAX, causing integer overflow in the total_weight calculation at line 30, leading to incorrect random selection probabilities or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] If multiple entry_points have extremely large weights (e.g., usize::MAX/2), does the sum() operation at line 30 wrap around silently in release mode, breaking the weighted selection invariant? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: new()] [DoS via Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker pass an extremely large Vec of entry_points to new(), causing excessive memory allocation in Arc::new() at line 33, leading to OOM and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: new()] [Invalid State] If all weights in entry_points are zero, total_weight becomes 0 at line 30. Does this cause division by zero or modulo by zero in pick_random() at line 44? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: new()] [Logic Error] Can an attacker provide an empty entry_points Vec, making total_weight = 0 and causing undefined behavior in subsequent pick_random() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: pick_random()] [Panic/DoS] At line 44, if total_weight is 0, does rng.gen_range(0, 0) panic or return undefined values, allowing an attacker to crash the transaction generator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: pick_random()] [Logic Error] If entry_points.len() == 1 but total_weight > 1, line 45 sets picked = 0, but the loop at lines 48-52 may skip the only entry if weight < total_weight, reaching unreachable!() at line 54?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: pick_random()] [Off-by-One Error] Does the comparison picked < *weight at line 49 correctly handle edge cases where picked == weight - 1, potentially causing biased selection toward early entries? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: pick_random()] [Panic Safety] The unreachable!() macro at line 54 should never execute, but if weight accounting is incorrect, this panics the entire node.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: pick_random()] [Bias in Selection] Does the weight selection algorithm at lines 48-52 produce uniformly distributed results, or can rounding errors cause certain entry points to be selected more/less frequently than their weights suggest?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/entry_points.rs] [Function: initialize_package()] [Resource Exhaustion] If many entry_points require initialization, the result Vec at line 67 could grow unbounded.
