  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Versioned State Access] When iterating backwards through versions, can the tool read state that was pruned but remains in memory caches, exposing data that should be permanently deleted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Version Bounds] Does the Version type properly validate against u64::MAX, or can overflow in version arithmetic when adding/subtracting cause wraparound to version 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Struct Tag Complexity] Can deeply nested generic type parameters in struct_tag strings cause stack overflow during StructTag::from_str() parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Address Validation] Does AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() validate against reserved system addresses (0x0, 0x1), or can querying these expose core framework state that should be protected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Version Validation] Is the version parameter validated to ensure it doesn't exceed latest_version before starting expensive scan operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Concurrency Bounds] Can concurrency parameter be set to extreme values (e.g., 10000) causing thread exhaustion, stack overflow, or kernel resource limits to be exceeded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Threshold Validation] Can slow_threshold_ms be set to 0 causing every fetch to be logged as slow, resulting in log flooding and disk exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Error Propagation] When state_kv_db.get_state_value_with_version_by_version() returns an error, does it properly distinguish between missing data (None) vs. database corruption (Err)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Partial Failure] If metadata_db succeeds but state_kv_db fails to open, can partially initialized database handles cause use-after-free or double-free errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Worker Error Handling] If a worker thread encounters a database error and returns early, does it properly signal completion or leave other threads waiting indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Unwrap Safety] Multiple .unwrap() calls in the worker thread - can any database operation fail in a way that panics the thread without proper error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Channel Send Failure] If result_tx.send() fails because the printer thread panicked, does the worker thread handle the error or panic itself, potentially leaving locks held? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Join Failure] If worker.join() returns Err indicating thread panic, is the error properly propagated or silently ignored leading to incomplete scan results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Tombstone Handling] When retrieving historical state values, does the tool properly handle tombstone markers indicating deleted resources, or can it return stale data that's been logically deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Transaction Boundaries] Can the tool read state values that are part of uncommitted transactions still in the write buffer, violating ACID properties? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Snapshot Isolation] Does the scan acquire a consistent snapshot at the start, or can it observe a mix of old and new state if commits happen during the scan? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Merkle-KV Mismatch] If a leaf exists in the Merkle tree but the corresponding value is missing from state_kv_db, does the tool detect this inconsistency or crash with .expect()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Pruning Race] Can running a scan while pruning operations are active cause the tool to read partially-pruned state, returning incorrect results or encountering missing data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [Large Value Handling] For values >1024 bytes that are truncated, is the full value still loaded into memory first, potentially causing OOM if querying multi-GB state objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Memory Accumulation] With billions of leaves, does the progress bar or result accumulation cause unbounded memory growth over the duration of the scan? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Channel Backpressure] If the printer thread processes results slower than workers produce them, can the unbounded mpsc channel accumulate millions of pending results causing OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Iterator Memory] Does JellyfishMerkleIterator buffer nodes in memory, and can scanning large trees cause excessive memory usage that impacts validator operations? (Medium)",
