  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Multiple Storage Services] If multiple storage services listen to the same notification channel (via cloned receivers), can race conditions in their refresh operations cause inconsistent views of committed state? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Clone on StorageServiceNotifier] [Unbounded Cloning] Can an attacker create an unbounded number of StorageServiceNotifier clones, exhausting memory or causing the underlying channel to accumulate excessive sender references? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Clone Cost] Does cloning the notification_sender at line 85 have hidden costs (reference counting overhead, lock contention) that could be exploited in high-frequency notification scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotifier] [Reference Counting] Does the channel use Arc internally, and can reference counting overflow or underflow be triggered by creating/dropping excessive notifier clones? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Pin Safety] Is the Pin usage in poll_next() at line 118 safe against Unpin violations, or can unsafe code elsewhere violate pinning guarantees and cause memory unsafety? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Poll Panics] Can poll_next() panic under any conditions (e.g., corrupted channel state), and if so, would this poison the entire state sync system? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: FusedStream] [Termination Invariant] After is_terminated() returns true, does poll_next() maintain the FusedStream contract of always returning Poll::Ready(None), or can it spuriously return Poll::Pending? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Context Waker] Can the Context waker be misused or cloned improperly, causing notifications to be delivered to the wrong task or lost entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: fmt() for StorageServiceCommitNotification] [Information Disclosure] Does the Display implementation at lines 135-142 expose sensitive version information in logs that could aid an attacker in timing attacks or state inference? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: fmt() for StorageServiceCommitNotification] [Format String] Can the Display implementation cause panics or excessive memory allocation if highest_synced_version is a pathological value like u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Trait: StorageServiceNotificationSender] [Unauthorized Notification] Can components other than the state sync driver obtain a StorageServiceNotifier and send unauthorized notifications, causing the storage service to process fake version updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_storage_service_notifier_listener_pair()] [Factory Security] Is the factory function publicly accessible, allowing malicious code to create rogue notifier-listener pairs that could intercept or inject notifications? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Impersonation] Can a compromised component clone the notifier and impersonate the state sync driver, sending false commit notifications to manipulate storage service behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Constant: STORAGE_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SIZE] [Burst Notification Loss] During a burst of rapid commits (e.g., 100 commits/second), how many notifications are effectively lost due to the size-1 LIFO channel, and can this cause unacceptable staleness in storage service data? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Fire-and-Forget Semantics] Does notify_new_commit() guarantee at-least-once delivery semantics, or can network interruptions, process crashes, or channel errors cause notifications to be lost without retry? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Slow Consumer] If the storage service listener is slow to process notifications, can backpressure from the size-1 channel cause the state sync driver to block indefinitely, affecting consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceCommitNotification] [Serialization Attack] Can an attacker exploit the Serialize/Deserialize derives to craft malicious serialized notifications that cause panics or memory corruption when deserialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Error] [Error Serialization] Can serialization/deserialization of Error enum fail or produce inconsistent results across different serde versions, causing cross-version compatibility issues? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Line 4: forbid(unsafe_code)] [Dependency Unsafe] While the file forbids unsafe code, can dependencies like aptos_channels contain unsafe code that violates memory safety assumptions in this module? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Panic Safety] If push() panics unexpectedly, can this leave shared state corrupted or cause other threads to deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Unwind Safety] Is the Stream implementation unwind-safe, or can panics during polling corrupt the receiver state and cause subsequent polls to misbehave? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Component Deadlock] Can circular dependencies between state sync and storage service create deadlock scenarios where the driver waits for notification acknowledgment while the listener waits for the driver? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotificationListener] [Blocking Operations] Can the storage service perform blocking operations while processing notifications, causing the notification channel to back up and affecting state sync progress? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_storage_service_notifier_listener_pair()] [Single Producer Assumption] Does the design assume a single state sync driver, and can multiple drivers sending notifications concurrently violate invariants and cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Causal Ordering] Can notifications be reordered due to async scheduling, causing the storage service to see version N+1 before version N, breaking causal consistency? (High)"
