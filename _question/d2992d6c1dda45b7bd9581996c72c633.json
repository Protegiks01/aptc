  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Consensus safety: Round advancement] Can attackers manipulate the OrderedWithWindow variant's execution pool dependencies to delay round advancement, causing liveness issues where blocks cannot be executed until dependencies arrive? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Consensus safety: Quorum certificate validity] Does ObservedOrderedBlock preserve the quorum certificate (QC) validation state from the underlying OrderedBlock, or can wrapping bypass QC verification required for consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Execution ordering: Dependency resolution] When ObservedOrderedBlock contains OrderedWithWindow, can the execution pool resolve dependencies correctly if parent blocks referenced in ExecutionPoolWindow are not yet received/stored? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Execution ordering: Out-of-order execution] If ordered_block() is called to extract the OrderedBlock from OrderedWithWindow without checking dependencies first, can this cause blocks to execute out-of-order, breaking state determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Execution ordering: Window truncation] If the ExecutionPoolWindow contains more parent block IDs than actually needed for execution, can unused dependencies cause performance degradation or incorrect execution behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Execution ordering: Missing dependencies] If ExecutionPoolWindow contains insufficient parent block IDs (window too small), can this cause execution to proceed without all required dependencies, breaking state consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Error handling: Panic on first_block/last_block] ObservedOrderedBlock.ordered_block() returns a reference to OrderedBlock which can panic in first_block()/last_block() if blocks vector is empty - is this panic-safe in async consensus observer contexts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Error handling: Pattern matching exhaustiveness] Does all code that pattern matches ObservedOrderedBlock handle both Ordered and OrderedWithWindow variants, or can missing match arms cause runtime panics when new execution pool messages arrive? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Error handling: Partial construction] Can ObservedOrderedBlock be constructed in a partially-initialized state where the enum variant doesn't match the actual data contents, causing subtle bugs in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Integration: Message routing] Does the consensus observer correctly route Ordered vs OrderedWithWindow messages to different processing paths (process_ordered_block_message vs process_ordered_block_with_window_message), or can incorrect routing occur? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Integration: Metrics labeling] Are Ordered and OrderedWithWindow variants tracked with different metric labels (ORDERED_BLOCK_LABEL vs ORDERED_BLOCK_WITH_WINDOW_LABEL) to monitor execution pool feature usage, or can metrics be misleading? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Integration: Epoch state synchronization] Does ObservedOrderedBlock carry sufficient epoch state information to validate it against the current EpochState in the consensus observer, or can epoch mismatch attacks occur? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Testing: Coverage gaps] Does new_for_testing() with random variant selection adequately test both Ordered and OrderedWithWindow code paths, or can flaky tests hide variant-specific bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Testing: Production behavior mismatch] Can the random selection in new_for_testing() create test scenarios that never occur in production (e.g., execution pool disabled nodes receiving OrderedWithWindow), masking real bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Code quality: Enum exhaustiveness] If a new variant is added to ObservedOrderedBlock in the future, will all existing match statements fail to compile (ensuring explicit handling), or can new variants be silently ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Performance: Clone overhead] Does the Clone implementation for ObservedOrderedBlock deep-clone the underlying OrderedBlock and ExecutionPoolWindow data, and can this cause performance issues in high-throughput scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Performance: Variant size disparity] If OrderedWithWindow variant is significantly larger than Ordered due to ExecutionPoolWindow, can this cause enum size inefficiency where all instances consume extra memory? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/execution_pool.rs] [Resource: Unbounded window growth] Can ExecutionPoolWindow.block_ids grow unbounded over time if not properly pruned, causing memory exhaustion in long-running observer nodes? (High)"
