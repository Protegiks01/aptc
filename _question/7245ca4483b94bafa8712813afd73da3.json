  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Enum: TimelineState] [Timeline Position Collision] Can multiple transactions share the same TimelineState::Ready(u64) position value, causing ordering conflicts that lead to non-deterministic broadcast behavior across different mempool instances and consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Enum: SubmittedBy] [Origin Spoofing] Can a malicious peer forge SubmittedBy::Client classification for their transactions to manipulate end-to-end latency metrics, hiding network performance issues and making the system appear healthier than it actually is? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Enum: SubmittedBy] [Downstream vs PeerValidator Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the logic that distinguishes SubmittedBy::Downstream from SubmittedBy::PeerValidator to misclassify transactions, causing incorrect latency measurements that mask validator network degradation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Enum: SubmittedBy] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker submit transactions with manipulated SubmittedBy classification to skew the submitted_by_label metrics, causing operators to misdiagnose network bottlenecks and make incorrect capacity planning decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: InsertionInfo::new()] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a manipulated insertion_time SystemTime value that's in the distant past or future, causing InsertionInfo::new() to create invalid insertion metadata that breaks TTL-based garbage collection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: InsertionInfo::new()] [Classification Logic Bypass] In InsertionInfo::new(), can an attacker set client_submitted=true AND timeline_state=NonQualified to create contradictory metadata that bypasses validation logic and causes inconsistent transaction handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: InsertionInfo::new()] [Ready Time Initialization] Does InsertionInfo::new() correctly initialize ready_time to equal insertion_time, or can race conditions cause ready_time to be set incorrectly, breaking latency calculations when transactions transition to Ready state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: InsertionInfo::new()] [Atomic Counter Initialization] Is the Arc<AtomicUsize> consensus_pulled_counter initialized with the correct Ordering semantics in InsertionInfo::new(), or can relaxed ordering cause lost updates when multiple threads increment the counter concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: submitted_by_label()] [Label Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the SubmittedBy enum value to cause submitted_by_label() to return unexpected label strings that break metric collection or Prometheus parsing, potentially causing monitoring system failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Function: submitted_by_label()] [Metric Cardinality Explosion] If submitted_by_label() is called with corrupted SubmittedBy values due to memory corruption, can it cause unbounded label cardinality in metrics systems, leading to monitoring infrastructure DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: expiration_time] [Expiration Bypass] Can an attacker set expiration_time to Duration::MAX, causing their transactions to remain in mempool indefinitely even after blockchain time advances far beyond the intended expiration, enabling long-term mempool pollution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: expiration_time] [TTL Comparison Issues] When expiration_time is compared with current SystemTime, can underflow/overflow in duration arithmetic cause premature or delayed expiration, allowing either censorship of valid transactions or retention of stale transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: ranking_score] [Score Overflow Attack] Can an attacker submit transactions with ranking_score set to u64::MAX that when compared in priority queues causes integer overflow in score difference calculations, inverting priority ordering and allowing low-priority transactions to jump ahead? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: ranking_score] [Zero Score Exploitation] Can an attacker submit valid transactions with ranking_score=0 that still get accepted into mempool, causing them to have lowest priority but never expire, gradually filling the mempool with unprofitable transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: timeline_state] [State Mutation Race] Is the timeline_state field properly protected from concurrent mutations, or can race conditions allow multiple threads to simultaneously transition a transaction's state, leading to invalid state combinations (e.g., Ready + NotReady)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: was_parked] [Parking State Confusion] Can the was_parked boolean flag be manipulated to incorrectly indicate a transaction was never parked when it actually was, breaking latency metrics and hiding sequence number gap issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: was_parked] [Double Parking Attack] Can an attacker force a transaction to be parked and unparked multiple times without updating was_parked correctly, causing metrics to underreport parking frequency and masking mempool performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: priority_of_sender] [Priority Downgrade Attack] Can a malicious node set priority_of_sender to None or Failover for high-value transactions from competitors, causing them to be delayed in broadcast and allowing the attacker to front-run those transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: insertion_time] [Time Rollback Attack] If SystemTime::now() experiences a backwards jump due to NTP corrections, can insertion_time be set to a future time, causing TTL calculations to fail and transactions to never expire? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: insertion_time] [Time Comparison Overflow] When computing durations between insertion_time and current time, can SystemTime arithmetic overflow if insertion_time is in the distant past, causing panics that crash the mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: ready_time] [Ready Time Manipulation] Can ready_time be set to a time before insertion_time, creating negative latency values that break metrics and potentially cause panics in duration calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: ready_time] [Stale Ready Time] If a transaction transitions from NotReady to Ready multiple times, is ready_time updated each time or only on first transition, causing inaccurate latency measurements for parked transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: park_time] [Park Time Leak] When transactions are unparked, is park_time properly cleared or does it retain stale values from previous parking events, causing incorrect park duration calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/core_mempool/transaction.rs] [Field: park_time] [Option Unwrap Panic] When accessing park_time as Option<SystemTime>, can unsafe unwrap() calls cause panics if park_time is None when it shouldn't be, leading to mempool crashes? (Medium)",
