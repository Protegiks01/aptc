(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: AugmentedEncryptionKey::verify_decryption_key()] [Digest binding] Is the digest properly cryptographically bound to the decryption key being verified, or can an attacker mix-and-match digests and decryption keys from different epochs or batches?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: EncryptionKey] [Field mutation] Are the struct fields actually immutable once constructed, or can safe Rust code obtain mutable references and modify G2Affine values, breaking key integrity? (High)",
