  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Information Disclosure] Could timing measurements printed to stdout via print!/println! macros leak sensitive information about internal operations if this utility is accidentally used in production consensus or transaction processing paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Side Channel] Could precise timing information exposed through this function enable timing side-channel attacks if used to measure cryptographic operations or other security-sensitive computations in the Move VM? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Panic/Error Handling] If stdout.flush() fails (line 13), the error is explicitly ignored with 'let _ ='. Could this lead to misleading timing outputs or incomplete logs that mask underlying system issues during critical operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Resource Exhaustion] Could repeated calls to time_it() with long message strings cause memory or I/O resource exhaustion if used extensively in test/benchmark suites affecting validator node stability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Timing Precision] Does Instant::now() provide sufficient precision and monotonicity guarantees across different platforms to ensure deterministic behavior if timing measurements influence any consensus or state transition logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Format String] Could malicious or malformed message strings passed to print! macro cause format string vulnerabilities or unexpected output that could be exploited in logging or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Generic Type Safety] Since time_it uses generic types F: FnOnce() -> R, could unsafe or malicious closures be passed that violate memory safety or cause undefined behavior when executed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/utils.rs] [Function: time_it()] [Thread Safety] Is this function safe to call from multiple threads concurrently? Could race conditions in stdout writes cause garbled output or affect timing accuracy in multi-threaded Move compilation or testing? (Low)"
