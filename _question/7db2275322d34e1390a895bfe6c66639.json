  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Eclipse Attack] Can a malicious peer isolate a validator and repeatedly send EpochRetrievalRequests with fabricated epoch ranges, preventing the validator from learning about real epoch changes and ejecting it from consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Amplification Attack] Can the ratio of request size (16 bytes for two u64s) to response size (potentially megabytes of epoch proofs) be exploited for network amplification attacks where small requests trigger large responses? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Sybil Attack] Can an attacker create many fake peer identities and send EpochRetrievalRequests from each, overwhelming honest validators with redundant epoch proof generation and network bandwidth consumption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Message Replay] Can captured EpochRetrievalRequest messages be replayed to cause validators to repeatedly regenerate and send the same epoch proofs, wasting CPU and network resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Timing Attack] Can measuring response times for EpochRetrievalRequests with different ranges reveal information about database index structure, cache hit rates, or epoch commit patterns that aid other attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Safety Break] If a Byzantine validator requests epochs that include conflicting validator sets (due to database inconsistency), can accepting these proofs cause validators to vote in parallel universes, breaking BFT safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Double Signing] Can requesting epoch proofs for ranges that include slashed validators cause honest nodes to accept signatures from validators that should be excluded, enabling double-signing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Quorum Certificate Forgery] Can manipulating start_epoch and end_epoch to reference epochs with weak validator sets (fewer than f+1 honest validators) allow Byzantine nodes to forge quorum certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Liveness Attack] Can flooding the network with EpochRetrievalRequests delay epoch transitions long enough to prevent reconfiguration, causing validators to remain in a compromised epoch where >1/3 are Byzantine? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Validator Set Manipulation] Can requesting epoch ranges that strategically include or exclude certain validator set changes allow attackers to manipulate voting power calculations and alter consensus outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Empty Range] What happens if start_epoch == end_epoch (e.g., both set to 5)? Does this request zero epochs, one epoch, or cause undefined behavior in the database iterator? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Genesis Epoch] Can requesting start_epoch=0 and end_epoch=0 exploit special handling of the genesis epoch to cause different behavior on validators with different genesis configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Future Epochs] Can setting start_epoch=current_epoch+1 and end_epoch=current_epoch+100 probe for future validator set information or cause database lookups that reveal planned epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Negative Range] Although Rust's u64 prevents negative numbers, can arithmetic operations elsewhere treat the range as signed, causing sign extension bugs when start_epoch > end_epoch? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Struct: EpochRetrievalRequest] [Off-by-One] Does the epoch range include both start_epoch and end_epoch (inclusive), or is one endpoint exclusive? Can confusion about inclusivity cause validators to diverge in their epoch state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Impl: Display] [Format String] Does the Display implementation at line 15-22 properly escape epoch values, or can extremely large u64 values cause buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities in logging systems? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Impl: Display] [Log Injection] Can malicious epoch values crafted to include special characters (though u64 limits this) be used for log injection attacks when EpochRetrievalRequest is logged? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Impl: Display] [Information Disclosure] Does logging EpochRetrievalRequest messages expose patterns about validator synchronization state that could help Byzantine nodes identify vulnerable validators to target? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Impl: Display] [Performance] Can an attacker trigger excessive logging of EpochRetrievalRequest via flood attacks, causing disk I/O saturation and impacting consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: check_epoch] [Validation Gap] The check_epoch validation only ensures end_epoch <= self.epoch(), but doesn't validate start_epoch. Can a Byzantine peer set start_epoch > end_epoch to bypass validation and cause database errors? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: process_epoch_retrieval] [Error Handling] If get_epoch_ending_ledger_infos fails with DbError, does the error propagate correctly, or can it cause the epoch_manager to enter an inconsistent state where subsequent requests are mishandled? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: process_different_epoch] [Logic Bug] When constructing EpochRetrievalRequest in process_different_epoch with start_epoch=self.epoch(), can this race with concurrent epoch transitions causing requests for non-existent epoch ranges? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: send_to] [Network Failure] If network_sender.send_to fails when sending EpochChangeProof response, does the requester timeout and retry indefinitely, causing resource exhaustion on both sides? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: initiate_new_epoch] [State Transition] Can receiving multiple EpochChangeProof responses from concurrent EpochRetrievalRequests cause race conditions in initiate_new_epoch leading to corrupted epoch state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/epoch_retrieval.rs] [Integration: check_epoch_ending_ledger_infos_request] [Validation Order] Does validation check start_epoch <= end_epoch BEFORE checking end_epoch <= latest_epoch, or can the order cause information leakage about latest_epoch to unauthorized peers? (Low)"
