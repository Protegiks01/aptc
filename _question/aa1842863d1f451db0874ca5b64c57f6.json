  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [No Retry] Does notify_new_commit() implement any retry logic on failure, or does a transient channel error cause permanent notification loss? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Error Recovery] After a CommitNotificationError, should the state sync driver retry, crash, or continue without notifying, and can wrong choices cause state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotifier] [Lifetime Constraints] Does the Clone implementation properly handle lifetime constraints, or can clones outlive the original and cause use-after-free? (Low)",

  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotificationListener] [Multi-threaded Polling] Can multiple threads poll the same listener concurrently, and if so, are notifications delivered correctly or can they be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceCommitNotification] [Field Validation] Should highest_synced_version be validated against current DB state before sending, or can stale/incorrect versions cause cascading failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Input Sanitization] Does notify_new_commit() validate that highest_synced_version is within expected bounds (e.g., not u64::MAX), or trust the caller completely? (Medium)",

  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: StorageServiceNotifier] [Sender Cleanup] When all notifiers are dropped, does the channel properly signal termination to the listener, or can it hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/inter-component/storage-service-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Double Error] If push() fails and creating the error string also fails (OOM), can this cause a double panic or undefined behavior? (Low)",
