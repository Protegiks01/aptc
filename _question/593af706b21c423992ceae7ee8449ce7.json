  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Enum: CommitMessage] [Ack payload] CommitMessage::Ack(()) uses unit type - can an attacker modify serialized bytes to include payload data in Ack causing deserialization size inflation? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Enum: CommitMessage] [Nack information leak] CommitMessage::Nack has no associated data - should it include error reason to prevent blind retry loops, or is this exploitable for information disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Author impersonation] In CommitVote verification, can author field be set to any validator address allowing Byzantine validator to create votes appearing to come from honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Signature malleability] Are BLS signatures in CommitVote/CommitDecision malleable, allowing attacker to create valid alternative signatures for same message causing equivocation detection bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Batch verification bypass] Does CommitDecision use batch signature verification, and if so, can attacker craft messages where batch passes but individual signatures are invalid? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Verification caching] If SignatureWithStatus caches verification results, can attacker reuse cached verification for different messages by manipulating cache keys? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Ordered-only bypass] CommitDecision verification rejects ordered-only commit info - can attacker craft message that appears non-ordered but actually is, bypassing this check? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Lock contention] Can Byzantine validators spam acks forcing high Mutex lock contention in validators.lock(), causing honest validator ack processing delays and consensus slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Deadlock potential] If multiple threads acquire validators Mutex in different orders across different AckState instances, can this cause deadlocks halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Arc reference counting] AckState is wrapped in Arc - can excessive cloning cause reference count overflow or make the struct un-droppable leading to memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Interior mutability] The Mutex provides interior mutability - can this violate Rust's aliasing rules if raw pointers to validators HashSet are created? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Trait: RBNetworkSender] [Network partition] Can Byzantine validators selectively respond to send_rb_rpc() from some peers but not others, creating asymmetric network view and consensus split? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Trait: RBNetworkSender] [Message reordering] Does reliable broadcast guarantee message ordering, or can network reorder Vote/Decision messages causing validators to process commits out of sequence? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Trait: RBNetworkSender] [Connection exhaustion] Can attacker force send_rb_rpc() to maintain open connections to Byzantine validators that never respond, exhausting connection pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Trait: RBNetworkSender] [Receiver validation] Does send_rb_rpc() validate that receiver is in current validator set before sending, or can messages be sent to arbitrary PeerIds? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Epoch transition race] During epoch change when validator set updates, can stale CommitVote/CommitDecision from old epoch be accepted in new epoch causing safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Epoch replay] Can attacker record CommitDecision from epoch N and replay in epoch N+K where same validator set exists, causing duplicate commits? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::epoch()] [Epoch validation gap] If epoch() returns Some(u64) but verify() doesn't check epoch freshness against current epoch, can old messages bypass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall protocol] [Broadcast interruption] Can Byzantine validators accept Vote/Decision messages but never send Ack responses, preventing reliable broadcast from completing and halting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall protocol] [Partial broadcast] If f Byzantine validators never ack, but 2f+1 honest validators do, does the protocol complete or wait forever for Byzantine acks causing liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall protocol] [Broadcast amplification] Can each validator receiving Vote/Decision trigger their own reliable broadcast creating exponential message amplification and network DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall protocol] [Equivocation detection] Does the protocol detect when Byzantine validators send different Votes for same epoch/round to different validators, or can equivocation go undetected? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Error propagation] When verify() returns Err, is the error properly logged with full context (sender, epoch, message type) or can error information be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Error semantics] Does add() returning Err mean to retry the ack or abort the broadcast - can ambiguous error semantics cause protocol confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Timeout handling] When timeout occurs, does the function return Err or hang forever - can timeout corner cases cause validator hangs? (High)"
