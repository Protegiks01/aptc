  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Panic safety] Can malformed header values cause unwrap() or panic in the to_str() or split_whitespace() operations, leading to denial of service of the faucet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Result handling] Does returning Ok(false) vs Ok(true) provide sufficient information to upstream callers, or can error cases be confused with authorization failures, leading to security decisions based on incorrect assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Inverted logic] Is the return Ok(false) at line 35 when X_IS_JWT_HEADER is present the correct behavior, or should it return an error to prevent JWT requests from accidentally falling through to other bypassers? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Authorization priority] Is the order of checks (X_IS_JWT_HEADER first, then Authorization) correct, or can this be exploited to bypass security by manipulating header order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Negative match handling] When manager.contains() returns false, does returning Ok(false) properly communicate to upstream code that this bypasser cannot authorize the request, or can it be misinterpreted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Token exposure] Are the loaded auth tokens logged by the info! macro at line 22-25, potentially exposing sensitive bypass tokens in system logs? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenBypasser] [Token lifetime] Does the ListManager hold tokens in memory for the entire lifetime of the faucet service, and can this lead to memory leaks if tokens are never removed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Token reloading] Is there a mechanism to reload the token list without restarting the service, or can attackers exploit stale tokens that should have been revoked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenBypasser] [Token persistence] Are bypass tokens stored only in memory in the ListManager.items HashSet, making them vulnerable to loss during service restarts or crashes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [CheckerData validation] Does the function validate all fields in CheckerData (receiver, source_ip, headers), or does it only check headers, allowing attackers with invalid addresses or IPs to bypass checks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Header duplication] Can an attacker send multiple Authorization headers or multiple X_IS_JWT_HEADER headers to cause the HeaderMap to behave unexpectedly, bypassing the checks? (High)",
