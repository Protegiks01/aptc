  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious PathBuf with '../../../etc/passwd' or similar traversal sequences to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive validator keys or configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Symbolic Link Attack] Does the path validation check if the provided PathBuf is a symbolic link pointing to sensitive system files, allowing attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read protected validator configuration or key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Race Condition - TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where an attacker could swap the configuration file between path validation and actual reading in read_configuration_from_file(), potentially loading malicious configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [File Permission Bypass] Does the function validate file permissions before reading, or can an attacker provide a path to world-readable files in restricted directories, potentially exposing confidential node configurations?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [YAML Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious YAML file with recursive anchors (e.g., '&a [*a]') that causes exponential expansion during serde_yaml deserialization, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [JSON Deeply Nested Objects] Can an attacker provide a JSON configuration file with thousands of nested objects that causes stack overflow during serde_json parsing, crashing the node-checker process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [YAML Billion Laughs Attack] Can a malicious YAML file with exponentially expanding entity references cause catastrophic memory consumption during deserialization, effectively DoS-ing the validation service? (High)",

Can an attacker provide a multi-gigabyte YAML/JSON file that exhausts memory when loaded into the BaselineConfiguration struct? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Array Explosion] Can a malicious configuration file contain an extremely large 'checkers' array (e.g., millions of CheckerConfig entries) that passes validation but causes memory exhaustion during build_checkers() execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [String Length DoS] Can configuration fields like configuration_id or configuration_name be arbitrarily long strings that consume excessive memory when deserializing BaselineConfiguration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Concurrent Validation DoS] If multiple validate() calls run concurrently on the same or different files, can resource exhaustion occur from unbounded parallel file I/O and deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Information Leak via Error Messages] Does the error context 'Configuration failed validation' leak sensitive information about internal validation logic or file paths through detailed error chains exposed to attackers?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Debug Logging Exposure] Does the debug! macro at line 20 log the full configuration including sensitive fields like public_key or node_address URLs, potentially exposing them in log files accessible to unauthorized parties?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate_configuration()] [Incomplete Validation] Does the function only validate that checkers can be built but skip validation of other critical BaselineConfiguration fields like node_address, configuration_id, or runner_config, allowing malicious configurations to pass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate_configuration()] [Empty Checkers Bypass] Can an attacker provide a configuration with an empty checkers vector that passes validation but later causes runtime failures or unexpected behavior in the node-checker service?
