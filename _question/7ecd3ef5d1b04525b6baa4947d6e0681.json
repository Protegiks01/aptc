  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [ListManager performance DoS] Does the ListManager.contains() operation scale linearly with blocklist size, allowing attackers to cause performance degradation by triggering checks when the blocklist is extremely large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [ListManager hash collision] If ListManager uses a HashSet, can attackers craft referer values that cause hash collisions, leading to false negatives where blocked referers aren't detected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [ListManager empty set] Does the checker handle the case where ListManager loads zero items properly, or could an empty blocklist file cause unexpected behavior or bypass all blocking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [ListManager duplicate entries] Does ListManager handle duplicate entries in the blocklist file correctly, or could duplicates cause memory bloat or unexpected matching behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [ListManager concurrent modification] Is the ListManager's items HashSet protected against concurrent reads during checking operations, or can race conditions occur if the blocklist is reloaded while checks are in progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Async race condition] Does the async check() method properly synchronize access to the shared ListManager, or can concurrent requests lead to race conditions when accessing the blocklist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Struct: RefererBlocklistChecker] [Memory ordering] Does the RefererBlocklistChecker ensure proper memory ordering when accessed from multiple threads, or can weak memory models lead to seeing stale or inconsistent blocklist data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Arc/reference counting] If RefererBlocklistChecker is wrapped in Arc for sharing, are there reference counting vulnerabilities or deadlocks when multiple async tasks hold references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Referer disclosure in rejection] Does the rejection message at line 42-45 leak the actual referer value to attackers, allowing them to confirm which domains are blocklisted and probe the blocklist contents?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Error format injection] Can attackers inject format string specifiers or special characters into the referer that get unsafely interpolated into the error message, potentially causing logging vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing side channel] Does the contains() check take consistent time regardless of match result, or can attackers use timing attacks to probe whether specific referers are in the blocklist? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Dry run bypass] The _dry_run parameter is unused in the implementation - can attackers exploit this to bypass intended dry-run protections or testing behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Dry run inconsistency] Since dry_run is ignored, does this cause behavioral inconsistencies with other checkers that respect the dry_run flag, potentially leading to incorrect eligibility checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: cost()] [Cost manipulation] Is the hardcoded cost value of 2 appropriate, or could attackers exploit checker ordering by making this checker run before/after other critical checks to bypass security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: cost()] [Cost underestimation] Does the cost value accurately reflect the actual computational expense of blocklist checking, or could large blocklists make this checker much more expensive than its cost suggests?
