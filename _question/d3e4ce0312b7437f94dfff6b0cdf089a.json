  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Decode bombing] Can maliciously crafted byte sequences cause decode_value() to consume excessive CPU time, enabling DoS attacks against block height queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [Index bloat attack] Can an attacker cause the RocksDB index for BlockByVersionSchema to grow unbounded, degrading query performance and affecting validator operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [Checksum absence] Does the schema include checksums or CRCs to detect silent data corruption in the encoded bytes, or can bit flips corrupt Version/BlockHeight mappings undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [Write-after-read race] Can writes to BlockByVersionSchema occur after a read but before the read result is used, causing time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Determinism violation] Is encode_key() deterministic across all platforms and Rust compiler versions, or can non-deterministic encoding cause validators to compute different RocksDB keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Non-canonical decoding] Can multiple different byte sequences decode to the same BlockHeight value, enabling encoding-based attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [Transaction rollback vulnerability] If a database transaction that writes to BlockByVersionSchema is rolled back, can partial writes remain visible, causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [BlockInfoSchema desync] If BlockByVersionSchema and BlockInfoSchema become desynchronized (one updated but not the other), can this cause validators to query for non-existent blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [EpochByVersionSchema conflict] Can inconsistencies between BlockByVersionSchema and EpochByVersionSchema cause validators to disagree on which epoch a block belongs to? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [TransactionSchema mismatch] If transactions are stored at versions not referenced in BlockByVersionSchema, can they become unreachable orphans? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [LedgerInfoSchema inconsistency] Can ledger info claim a different latest version than what's stored in BlockByVersionSchema, causing state verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [REST API manipulation] Can corrupted BlockByVersionSchema entries cause the REST API's get_block_by_height() to return wrong blocks, misleading users and dApps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockByVersionSchema] [State proof forgery] Can manipulated block height mappings enable forging of state proofs that claim transactions are in different blocks than they actually are? (Critical)",
