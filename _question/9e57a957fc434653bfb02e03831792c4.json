  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Field: input_transactions] [Deprecated field risks] Is the DEPRECATED input_transactions field at line 198 still used anywhere, and can stale transaction data cause execution mismatches or replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Field: input_transactions] [Serialization compatibility] Can the deprecation of input_transactions cause deserialization failures when receiving blocks from older protocol versions, breaking network compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Struct: ExecutionSummary] [Gas units calculation] Can block_effective_gas_units() at line 299 be manipulated to return inflated values, allowing transactions to consume more gas than paid for or bypass gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Struct: ExecutionSummary] [Gas None handling] When gas_used is None at line 299, how do downstream systems handle this, and can this be exploited to execute transactions without proper gas metering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: compute_result()] [Lock acquisition] Does compute_result() acquire state_compute_result.lock() for minimal time, or can long lock duration during clone at line 435 block critical consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: set_compute_result()] [Result validation] Is the StateComputeResult parameter validated for consistency with block transactions before being stored at line 301, preventing Byzantine validators from injecting arbitrary execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: set_insertion_time()] [Double insertion] Can concurrent pipeline stage initialization call set_insertion_time() twice, triggering the assertion at line 331 and crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: set_compute_result()] [Expect panic] Can the expect() at line 322 panic if execution_summary OnceCell is somehow corrupted, causing validator crash during execution result storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: wait_for_compute_result()] [Pipeline None] Can wait_for_compute_result() be called after pipeline is aborted, returning 'Pipeline aborted' error that is misinterpreted as execution failure, causing block retry loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Function: wait_for_commit_ledger()] [Silent cancellation] Does wait_for_commit_ledger() at line 560 silently ignore cancellation errors via _ = , potentially masking commit failures that leave ledger in inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Struct: PipelinedBlock] [Field visibility] Are all Mutex and OnceCell fields properly encapsulated, or can direct access bypass synchronization and cause race conditions in external code? (Medium)"
