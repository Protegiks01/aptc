  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Does the test file validate reward distribution logic, or could reward calculation bugs go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Are epoch transitions and validator set updates properly tested to ensure no validators are lost during reconfiguration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Does the test file cover concurrent operations like multiple validators joining/leaving simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Are there tests for Byzantine validator behavior such as double-signing or invalid consensus key usage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Does the test file validate that operator_address cannot perform stake withdrawal operations reserved for owner? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Are there tests ensuring voter_address cannot perform staking operations beyond voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Test coverage] Does the test file cover stake delegation scenarios where one account delegates to another validator? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [MoveHarness dependency] Can MoveHarness.read_resource() return stale or cached data instead of latest state, causing tests to miss state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/stake.rs] [Transaction status] Do all helper functions properly check TransactionStatus for execution success, or could failed transactions be treated as successful? (High)",
