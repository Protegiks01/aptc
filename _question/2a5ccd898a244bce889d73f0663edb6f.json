  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Correlation Violation] The documentation implies execution_gas_units, io_gas_units, and storage fees should sum to total_charge_gas_units - can they be set independently to violate this invariant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: new()] [Unchecked Construction] Does new() enforce any relationship between the five parameters, or can completely arbitrary and inconsistent values be passed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: clear_refunds()] [Unsafe Mutation] Is clear_refunds() the only mutable method, and can its use be controlled to prevent unauthorized fee manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Immutability] Should FeeStatement be immutable after creation (except clear_refunds), and can violation of this enable post-hoc fee tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Struct: FeeStatement] [Unit Mismatch] Three fields use gas_units while two use octas - can this unit mismatch be exploited in arithmetic operations that assume uniform units? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/fee_statement.rs] [Function: add_fee_statement()] [Unit Confusion] Does add_fee_statement() correctly handle adding octas to octas and gas_units to gas_units, or can unit confusion cause incorrect totals? (Low)"
