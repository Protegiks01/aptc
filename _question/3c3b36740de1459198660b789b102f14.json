  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Parameter validation] Can an attacker create a GenesisInfo with min_stake > max_stake, bypassing validator economic security and allowing arbitrary validators to join the network without proper stake requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Integer overflow] Can min_stake, max_stake, or required_proposer_stake values overflow when used in arithmetic operations during genesis, potentially causing validator set manipulation or economic security bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Economic attack] Can setting min_voting_threshold to 0 or an extremely low value allow governance takeover by attackers with minimal stake, enabling protocol parameter manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Economic attack] Can rewards_apy_percentage exceed 100%, causing excessive token inflation and economic collapse through unlimited token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Time manipulation] Can epoch_duration_secs be set to 0 or an extremely small value, causing rapid epoch transitions that could destabilize consensus or enable validator set manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Validator duplication] Can the validators vector contain duplicate validator addresses, allowing a single entity to control multiple validator slots and exceed the Byzantine fault tolerance threshold? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty validator set] Can an empty validators vector be passed, creating a genesis state with no validators that results in immediate network failure and total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Type conversion] Does the TryInto conversion on line 96 properly handle all error cases from ValidatorConfiguration, or can malformed configs bypass validation and corrupt the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Chain ID collision] Can an attacker use a mainnet chain_id for a test network or vice versa, causing chain splits or replay attacks across different Aptos networks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Root key validation] Is the root_key Ed25519PublicKey validated for correctness, or can an invalid/zero key be used that prevents any administrative operations post-genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Framework bundle] Can a malicious or corrupted ReleaseBundle be passed, injecting backdoored Move code into the genesis state that compromises the entire blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration cloning] Are all cloned configurations (consensus_config, execution_config, etc.) properly validated, or can attackers inject invalid configs that bypass subsequent validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Voting manipulation] Can voting_duration_secs be set to an extremely short duration (e.g., 1 second), enabling governance proposal manipulation before honest validators can review and vote? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Voting power] Can voting_power_increase_limit be set to 100% or higher, allowing rapid validator set changes that could enable coordinated attacks or consensus manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Lockup bypass] Can recurring_lockup_duration_secs be set to 0, allowing instant stake withdrawals that undermine economic security and enable quick exit scams by validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Stake bounds] Is there validation that min_stake is non-zero, or can 0 min_stake allow Sybil attacks where attackers create thousands of validators with negligible stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Struct: GenesisInfo] [Stake overflow] Can the total stake of all validators overflow u64, causing integer wrapping that corrupts voting power calculations and consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_genesis()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to get_genesis() on the same GenesisInfo instance create race conditions where multiple genesis transactions are generated with different state roots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_genesis()] [State mutation] After genesis is cached in line 131, can any GenesisInfo fields be mutated, causing inconsistency between the cached genesis and the current configuration state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_genesis()] [Unwrap safety] Is the unwrap() on line 132 guaranteed safe, or can genesis field be None after setting, causing a panic that disrupts node initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_genesis()] [Memory exhaustion] Can repeated calls to get_genesis() on a cloned GenesisInfo consume excessive memory by caching multiple genesis transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_genesis_txn()] [Hardcoded test mode] Why is is_test hardcoded to true on line 145, and can this allow test-mode vulnerabilities (like weaker crypto or disabled checks) to persist in production genesis? (Critical)",
