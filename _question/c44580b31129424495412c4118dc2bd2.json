  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: is_indexer_async_v2_pending_on_empty()] [Pending leak detection] The function only warns about pending items but doesn't block or fail, can persistent pending items indicate bugs that should halt indexing to prevent data loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: save_table_info()] [Result insertion] self.result.insert() overwrites existing entries, but can duplicate table handles from different write ops cause the wrong TableInfo to be persisted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: TableInfoParser::get_table_info()] [Result clone] table_info.clone() is called when returning from the result HashMap, can cloning complex TypeTag structures be expensive and cause performance issues with large batches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: index_with_annotator()] [Write op iteration] write_set.write_op_iter() is called for each write set, but can malicious write sets contain duplicate state keys causing table info to be processed multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_write_op()] [Write op bytes] write_op.bytes() provides the value, but can deletion operations (None bytes) be mishandled causing table info to persist for deleted resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: index_table_info()] [DbReader trait] Arc<dyn DbReader> is passed as parameter, but can the DbReader implementation return stale or inconsistent state affecting table info extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: index_table_info()] [State view creation] state_view_at_version() may fail if the version doesn't exist, but is this error properly propagated or can it cause silent failures in table info indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: new()] [Version extraction] MetadataValue::expect_version() is called on the database result, can this panic if the metadata contains non-version data due to database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: next_version()] [Unwrap safety] The function uses unwrap() on the database get result, can database errors cause panics during normal operation when querying next version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_write_op()] [Path conversion] access_path.path is converted with try_into(), but can malformed access paths bypass table info collection by failing the conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_write_op()] [Pattern matching] The match on Path has three branches but only processes Resource and ResourceGroup, can important table info in Code modules be missed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_table_item()] [Handle dereferencing] The handle is dereferenced with *handle when passed to get_table_info(), can this cause issues with handle copy semantics or lifetime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: process_table_infos()] [Handle wrapping] MoveTableInfo.handle is wrapped as TableHandle(handle), but is the underlying Address type validated to prevent malicious handle creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: index_with_annotator()] [Partial processing] If an error occurs mid-batch, the entire batch is aborted with bail!(), but can this cause table info loss for write sets processed before the error? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_write_op()] [Error propagation] All errors are propagated with '?', but can recoverable errors (e.g., one malformed resource) abort the entire batch preventing other valid resources from being indexed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: get_table_info_with_retry()] [Retry delay] TABLE_INFO_RETRY_TIME_MILLIS is only 10ms, can attackers intentionally create missing table handle scenarios to force threads into tight spin loops consuming CPU? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: finish_table_info_parsing()] [Batch write performance] result.iter().try_for_each() processes all table handles sequentially, can batches with thousands of handles cause unacceptable latency blocking other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_resource_group()] [BCS deserialization cost] Large BTreeMaps are fully deserialized, can attackers create resources with megabytes of data causing CPU and memory spikes during indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: create_checkpoint()] [Path validation] The path parameter is used directly without validation, can relative paths like '../../' escape the intended checkpoint directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: create_checkpoint()] [Concurrent checkpoints] If multiple threads call create_checkpoint() concurrently on the same path, can this cause file corruption or incomplete checkpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: index_with_annotator()] [Batch creation] A new SchemaBatch is created for each call, but can multiple concurrent calls create conflicting batches that race during write_schemas()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: finish_table_info_parsing()] [Batch mutation] The batch parameter is &mut SchemaBatch, can caller reuse the same batch for multiple calls causing table info from different versions to be mixed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: save_table_info()] [Entry API] pending_on.remove() returns Option<(TableHandle, DashSet<Bytes>)>, but only .1 is used, can the TableHandle key differ from the input handle parameter indicating a bug? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: collect_table_info_from_table_item()] [DashSet insertion] or_default().insert(bytes.clone()) may fail if the set has capacity limits, but is this failure handled or can it silently lose pending items? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db_v2.rs] [Function: update_next_version()] [Off-by-one] The stored version is end_version - 1, but should next_version be end_version to properly track the next unprocessed version? Can this off-by-one cause version reprocessing? (Medium)"
