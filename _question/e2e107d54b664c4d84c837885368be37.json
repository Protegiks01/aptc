  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Epoch: epoch_state()] [Stale epoch state] If epoch_state() returns cached epoch information that's outdated, can validators verify TCs or QCs against wrong validator sets, accepting invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Epoch: validator set changes] [Validator removal] When a validator is removed from the set during epoch transition, can they continue signing with old safety_data from the previous epoch, causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Error: Result propagation] [Panic vs Error] Do all error paths return proper Error types, or can unexpected panics occur that cause validator crashes and liveness failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Error: Early returns] [State cleanup] When functions return early due to errors (e.g., line 42, 60, 103), are any partial state modifications properly rolled back, or can they leave safety_data in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Error: Skip sig verify mode] [Production risk] Is skip_sig_verify properly protected from being enabled in production, or can misconfigurations or attacks enable it, bypassing all signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Edge case: round 0] [Genesis handling] Do all functions handle round 0 (genesis) correctly, especially in comparisons like next_round(0) == 1, or can genesis blocks cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Edge case: empty QC] [Nil blocks] Can proposals with empty or nil QCs pass verification and safety checks, potentially enabling attacks that commit blocks without proper parent chains? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/safety_rules_2chain.rs] [Edge case: first round] [Bootstrap] During first round after genesis or epoch change, can the lack of previous votes or timeouts cause safe_to_vote or safe_to_timeout to incorrectly reject valid messages? (Medium)"
