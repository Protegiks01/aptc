  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] Are the public module exports (backup_types, coordinators, metadata, metrics, storage, utils) intentionally exposed as public API surface, and could this expose sensitive backup/restore operations to unauthorized callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic Safety] The clippy::arithmetic_side_effects lint is globally disabled for this entire crate - could this mask integer overflow vulnerabilities in the backup/restore logic within child modules that handle transaction counts, version numbers, or byte sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] Does the separation of backup operations across six distinct modules (backup_types, coordinators, metadata, metrics, storage, utils) introduce potential race conditions or state inconsistencies during concurrent backup/restore operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/lib.rs] [Access Control] Since all modules are declared as 'pub mod', does this allow external crates to directly instantiate backup coordinators or manipulate backup metadata, potentially bypassing intended access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/lib.rs] [Dependency Exposure] The public module structure may expose internal implementation details - could attackers analyze the backup_types and storage modules to identify weaknesses in backup encryption, compression, or serialization formats? (Low)"
