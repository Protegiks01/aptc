  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Key Rotation Attack] During OIDC provider key rotation, can an attacker time their malicious keyless transaction to exploit the window where validators have inconsistent JWK observations, potentially authenticating with a revoked key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Resource Exhaustion via Governance] Can a malicious governance proposal add hundreds of OIDC providers with extremely short fetch intervals, causing validators to exhaust network resources and CPU processing JWK requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Denial of Service via Slow Response] Can an attacker-controlled OIDC provider respond extremely slowly to JWK requests, tying up tokio async tasks and preventing legitimate JWK observations from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Sybil Attack on JWK Consensus] Can an attacker register multiple OIDC providers (via governance) that all point to attacker-controlled endpoints, flooding the JWK consensus with malicious observations and potentially overwhelming legitimate providers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Fetch Interval] What happens if fetch_interval is Duration::ZERO? Does the interval tick immediately and continuously, causing infinite HTTP requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Issuer String] Can spawn() be called with an empty issuer string? Would this cause issues when comparing issuers in consensus or accessing JWK maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Malformed URL Schemes] What happens if config_url uses unsupported schemes like 'ftp://', 'file://', or 'javascript:'? Are these properly rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode Normalization] If issuer or config_url contain Unicode characters, are they normalized consistently across validators? Can different Unicode normalizations cause consensus mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Very Large Epoch Numbers] Can extremely large epoch numbers cause integer overflow in logging or future calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Concurrent Shutdown] If multiple threads call shutdown() on the same observer concurrently, does the oneshot channel handle this safely or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Max Duration Fetch Interval] If fetch_interval is set to Duration::MAX, would the observer effectively never fetch, causing keyless accounts to use permanently stale JWKs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Edge Case] [Observer Creation During Shutdown] Can a new observer be spawned while an old one is shutting down for the same issuer? Could this cause race conditions in JWK observations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [External Integration] [OIDC Provider Compromise] If a supported OIDC provider is compromised and serves malicious JWKs, what are the limits on damage? Can this lead to unauthorized access to all keyless accounts for that provider? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [External Integration] [Certificate Pinning] Does the system support certificate pinning for OIDC providers? Can an attacker with a fraudulent CA certificate intercept JWK fetches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [External Integration] [Rate Limiting] If OIDC providers implement rate limiting, can validators be rate-limited differently based on their request patterns, causing some to fail JWK fetches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [External Integration] [OIDC Provider Downtime] If an OIDC provider experiences downtime, how does this affect validators' ability to authenticate keyless transactions? Is there graceful degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Testing] [Fuzzing Coverage] Has the URL parsing and JWK deserialization logic been fuzzed? Can unexpected inputs cause panics or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Testing] [Chaos Engineering] Has the observer been tested under network partition, high latency, and packet loss conditions? Can network issues cause security-relevant failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Testing] [Concurrency Testing] Has the observer been tested with high concurrency (many simultaneous observers, rapid spawn/shutdown cycles)? Can race conditions emerge under load? (Medium)"
