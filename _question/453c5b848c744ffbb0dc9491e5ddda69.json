  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [GenesisTransaction replay] Can GenesisTransaction types be replayed after genesis if they're marked Valid without additional timestamp or epoch checks, causing reinitialization of blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [BlockMetadataExt exploitation] For BlockMetadataExt with randomness, can attackers manipulate the Valid tag to accept blocks with biased or predictable randomness values? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Enum discriminant manipulation] Can unsafe code or memory corruption change the enum discriminant from Invalid to Valid without re-verification, bypassing all security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Memory layout exploitation] Are Valid and Invalid variants laid out in memory such that buffer overflows or type confusion could convert one to the other? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Lifetime safety] When references to SignatureVerifiedTransaction are held across await points or Arc boundaries, can the underlying Transaction be modified, invalidating the Valid guarantee? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Consensus vs. Execution disagreement] Can consensus mark a transaction as Valid while execution marks it Invalid (or vice versa) due to state differences, causing non-deterministic commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Multi-signature transaction bypass] For multi-agent transactions, does verification check all signers, or can partially signed transactions be marked Valid if the primary sender's signature is correct? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Fee-payer transaction exploitation] In fee-payer transactions, if only the sender signature is verified but not the fee-payer's, can attackers execute transactions without fee-payer consent? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Function: From<Transaction>::from()] [Secondary signer bypass] Does verify_signature() check all secondary signers in multi-agent transactions, or can attackers submit transactions with missing secondary signatures that still get marked Valid? (Critical)"
