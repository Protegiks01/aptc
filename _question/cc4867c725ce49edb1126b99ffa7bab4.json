  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker bypass the expose_configuration flag check by exploiting race conditions between configuration reads and flag updates, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive validator configuration data including network topology and consensus parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does the debug formatting at line 19 properly sanitize all secret keys, or can certain NodeConfig fields with SilentDisplay/SilentDebug bypass leak validator private keys, consensus secrets, or network authentication credentials when exposed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Access Control Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the node_config.inspection_service.expose_configuration flag through a separate configuration reload mechanism or API endpoint to enable this endpoint without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does the NodeConfig struct contain sensitive consensus state information (e.g., current epoch, validator set, voting power distribution) that could be exploited by attackers to predict block proposals or validator rotation patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Disclosure] Can exposing the full NodeConfig reveal network peer information, IP addresses, port configurations, or firewall rules that enable targeted attacks on specific validators or network partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Race Condition] Is the NodeConfig reference read atomically, or can concurrent configuration updates during the format operation at line 19 result in partially inconsistent configuration data being exposed, potentially revealing intermediate states with security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [TOCTOU] Can an attacker exploit a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where expose_configuration is checked at line 15 but the configuration is formatted at line 19, allowing configuration changes between these operations to leak sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call this function concurrently while the configuration is being updated, can this create data races that expose uninitialized or partially initialized configuration fields containing garbage memory or secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Format String Vulnerability] Does the Debug formatter implementation at line 19 handle all field types safely, or can custom Debug implementations in NodeConfig fields inject malicious output, control characters, or escape sequences that could exploit terminal/log processing systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can the debug formatting operation at line 19 allocate unbounded memory for deeply nested or circular configuration structures, causing validator node OOM crashes and consensus liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Disclosure] Are all cryptographic keys (BLS signing keys, network encryption keys, validator consensus keys) properly wrapped with SilentDisplay/SilentDebug, or can the format operation at line 19 leak any key material through custom Display implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Timing Attack] Does the debug formatting operation at line 19 have variable execution time based on secret configuration values (e.g., key lengths, epoch numbers), allowing side-channel attacks to infer sensitive information through response timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Response Smuggling] Does the CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT at line 28 properly set charset and encoding headers to prevent HTTP response smuggling attacks where malicious configuration data could be interpreted as HTTP headers by intermediate proxies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [XSS/Content Injection] Can malicious configuration values injected through config files contain HTML/JavaScript that gets rendered when this endpoint output is viewed in browsers or monitoring dashboards, enabling XSS attacks against node operators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Information Leakage] Does the FORBIDDEN response at lines 22-25 leak information about whether the endpoint exists, allowing attackers to fingerprint Aptos node versions or probe for vulnerable configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Constant: CONFIGURATION_DISABLED_MESSAGE] [Information Disclosure] Does the error message at lines 9-10 reveal too much implementation detail about the node configuration structure (inspection_service.expose_configuration path), aiding attackers in crafting targeted configuration manipulation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Configuration Tampering] Is the NodeConfig reference validated for integrity before formatting at line 19, or can an attacker who compromises the configuration source inject malicious values that get exposed through this endpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [State Consistency] If the node configuration contains consensus-critical parameters (epoch duration, timeout values, quorum thresholds), can exposing these values allow attackers to identify misconfigured nodes vulnerable to consensus attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Configuration Injection] Can the NodeConfig contain user-controlled or externally-sourced data that was not properly sanitized, allowing configuration injection attacks where malicious values get exposed and used by other components reading this endpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Audit Logging] Does this function log access attempts to the configuration endpoint, or can attackers repeatedly query this endpoint to extract configuration data without leaving audit trails for security monitoring?
