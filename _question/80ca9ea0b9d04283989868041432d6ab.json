  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/timeout.rs] [Function: poll()] [Determinism] Is the timeout behavior at lines 49-54 deterministic across all validators? Could non-deterministic timeout behavior cause validators to diverge on consensus state, leading to chain forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/timeout.rs] [Function: poll()] [Byzantine tolerance] Can a Byzantine validator exploit the timeout implementation to cause more than 1/3 of validators to experience different timeout behaviors, breaking the Byzantine fault tolerance assumption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/timeout.rs] [Struct: Timeout] [Consensus liveness] Can an attacker craft scenarios where all Timeout instances in consensus perpetually return Pending (never Ready), causing total loss of liveness and halting the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/timeout.rs] [Function: poll()] [Safety violation] Can the race between future completion at line 49 and timeout expiration at line 54 ever cause consensus to commit conflicting blocks, violating the fundamental safety property of AptosBFT consensus? (Critical)"
