  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Error handling] [Anyhow error context] Does request_can_bypass() return meaningful error messages through anyhow::Result, or could generic errors hide security-relevant information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Error handling] [Panic safety] Are there any possible panic conditions in request_can_bypass() or new() that could crash the entire faucet service? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Testing gap] [Negative testing] Are there tests that verify request_can_bypass() correctly rejects IPs NOT in the allowlist, preventing false positives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/ip_allowlist.rs] [Testing gap] [Boundary testing] Are CIDR range boundaries (first and last IP in range) tested to ensure correct inclusive/exclusive logic? (Low)",
