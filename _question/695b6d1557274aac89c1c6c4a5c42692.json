  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: is_cmp()] [Comparison Module Substitution] Similar to is_vector(), can an attacker create a fake cmp module at address 0x1 with the correct name to substitute critical comparison operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Module ID Assignment] Lines 348-361 assign sequential ModuleIds based on module_count enumeration - can an attacker manipulate the dependency_order to cause security-critical modules to get IDs that conflict with or overwrite other modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Address Resolution Race] Line 352 calls builder.resolve_address() - can concurrent calls or caching issues cause the same named address to resolve to different numerical addresses in different modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Module Table Poisoning] Lines 363 inserts module_name -> module_id mappings - can an attacker cause hash collisions or provide duplicate module names to overwrite existing mappings? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [ModuleBuilder State Corruption] Each ModuleBuilder instance at line 364 shares mutable access to the parent ModelBuilder - can race conditions or incorrect state management cause one module's translation to corrupt another module's data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Script Module ID Collision] Lines 367-374 assign ModuleIds to scripts starting from env.module_data.len() - can concurrent modifications to module_data cause ID collisions between scripts and regular modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Pseudo Script Name Collision] Line 369 generates pseudo script names - can an attacker create actual modules with names that collide with these pseudo names to cause confusion in module resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Script to Module Conversion Error] Line 372 calls expansion_script_to_module() - can malformed scripts cause the conversion to produce invalid module definitions that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Environment Population Race] Line 377 calls builder.populate_env() after all translations - can incomplete or partially failed translations cause the environment to be populated with inconsistent data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Unused Schema Exploitation] Line 380 warns about unused schemas - can an attacker define malicious schemas that are never actually used, bypassing validation while still being available for runtime exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_move_checker()] [Friend Declaration Manipulation] Lines 382 and 385 handle friend declarations - can an attacker manipulate the order of these operations to create invalid friend relationships that bypass package visibility checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Module Table Takeover] Line 399 uses std::mem::take() on builder.module_table - can this temporary removal of the module table allow concurrent operations to operate on an empty table, causing security checks to pass incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Self-Friend Detection Bypass] Lines 423-425 detect self-friend declarations only if module IDs match - can an attacker declare a module as a friend using a different name resolution path to bypass this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Cross-Address Friend Attack] Lines 412-418 check if friend addresses match - but the check happens after setting module_id - can an attacker exploit this ordering to create cross-address friend relationships temporarily? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Unbound Module Exploitation] Lines 426-430 handle unbound modules in friend declarations - can an attacker declare non-existent modules as friends to defer validation and later inject malicious modules with those names? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Friend Module Set Inconsistency] Line 432 assigns friend_modules to module.friend_modules - can partial failures in the loop cause some modules to have incomplete friend sets, breaking visibility guarantees?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Error Reporting After State Modification] Lines 434-465 report errors after the module data has been modified - can an attacker trigger errors that leave the environment in an inconsistent state with partially updated friend relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Friend Declaration Ordering Attack] The function iterates through module_data.iter_mut() without a specific order - can non-deterministic iteration order cause friend validation to behave differently across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_and_update_friend_info()] [Module ID Assignment Race] Friend module IDs are looked up from module_table at line 419 - can a time-of-check-time-of-use issue allow module IDs to change between the lookup and the assignment?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: collect_related_modules_recursive()] [Stack Overflow Attack] The recursive function has no depth limit - can an attacker craft circular or deeply nested module dependencies to cause stack overflow and crash the compiler?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: collect_related_modules_recursive()] [Dependency Cycle Exploitation] While visited_modules prevents infinite loops, can an attacker exploit the fact that cyclic dependencies are allowed to create unexpected module inclusion patterns?
