  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: PublicParameters::default()] [Cryptographic weakness] Can an attacker exploit the `unsafe_hash_to_affine` function to generate weak or predictable group elements G and H, potentially breaking the discrete log assumption and allowing decryption without the secret key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Function: PublicParameters::default()] [Deterministic generator attack] Since G and H are deterministically derived from fixed DST strings 'G' and 'H', can an attacker precompute discrete log tables or exploit known structure in these generators to break encryption security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Lines: 45-50] [Generator collision] The debug_assert_ne! only runs in debug mode - can an attacker in production exploit a scenario where G equals H, breaking the ElGamal security assumption and allowing trivial decryption of all ciphertexts? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Constant: DST] [Domain separation attack] The DST constant is shared for both G and H generation - can an attacker exploit insufficient domain separation to find relationships between generators or break the random oracle assumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Missing validation] The encryption keys in `eks` slice are never validated - can an attacker provide identity elements, low-order points, or invalid curve points as encryption keys to break ciphertext security or cause decryption failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Key reuse attack] Can multiple participants use the same encryption key in the `eks` array, allowing key confusion attacks where one validator can decrypt another's shares in the DKG protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_elgamal.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Lifetime safety] The homomorphism struct uses references with lifetime 'a - can lifetime issues lead to use-after-free or dangling pointer bugs when public parameters or encryption keys go out of scope during DKG ceremonies?
