  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: CoinStore] [Event handle manipulation] Can attackers craft deposit_events or withdraw_events with manipulated counts or addresses to create fake transaction histories or bypass audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: FungibleStore::new()] [Concurrent balance flag exploitation] If concurrent_balance is true but balance is non-zero, does this create inconsistent state where regular balance and concurrent balance both exist? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: FungibleStore::to_bytes()] [Event handle count mismatch] The ObjectCoreResource is created with event handle count 0 - can this allow unlimited events without incrementing the counter, bypassing event limits?
