  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: routes()] [Recovery Handler Exploitation] Can the handle_rejection recovery function be triggered intentionally to extract error details or bypass proper error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_rejection()] [Information Disclosure] The error response includes format!('unexpected error: {:?}', err) which may leak internal implementation details, stack traces, or sensitive data to attackers (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_rejection()] [Error Injection] Can an attacker deliberately trigger specific Rejection types to probe internal state or gather information about the system architecture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_rejection()] [CORS Wildcard Bypass] The response sets 'access-control-allow-origin: *' - can this enable attackers to make cross-origin requests that should be blocked for security reasons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: handle_rejection()] [Status Code Abuse] All errors return INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500) - can attackers use this to mask the true nature of errors or bypass retry logic in clients? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: health_check()] [Integer Overflow] Can extremely large duration_secs values (u64::MAX) cause integer overflow in the underlying health_check implementation, leading to crashes or bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/lib.rs] [Function: health_check()] [Zero Duration Attack] Can setting duration_secs to 0 bypass health checks entirely, making an unhealthy node appear healthy and enabling attacks on stale data? (High)",
