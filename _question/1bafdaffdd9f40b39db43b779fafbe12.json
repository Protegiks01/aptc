  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_tree()] [Atomicity violation] Can a crash between saving blocks and quorum_certs result in inconsistent state where blocks exist without their corresponding QCs, potentially causing consensus to halt upon recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_tree()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to save_tree() from different threads cause interleaved writes that corrupt the block tree structure, leading to consensus safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_tree()] [Byzantine attack] Can a Byzantine validator craft malicious blocks with circular parent references that pass save_tree() validation but cause infinite loops during recovery traversal? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: prune_tree()] [Safety violation] Can prune_tree() delete blocks that are still needed for consensus safety (e.g., blocks in the 3-chain commit window), causing validators to lose critical voting history and violating AptosBFT safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: prune_tree()] [Race condition] If prune_tree() executes concurrently with save_tree(), can it delete blocks that were just saved, causing consensus state corruption and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: prune_tree()] [Atomicity violation] Does prune_tree() atomically delete both blocks and their corresponding QCs, or can partial deletion leave orphaned QCs that cause recovery failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_vote()] [Replay attack] Can save_vote() be called multiple times with different votes for the same round, allowing a validator to equivocate and violate consensus safety without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_vote()] [Epoch confusion] Does save_vote() validate that the vote's epoch matches the current epoch, or can stale votes from previous epochs be persisted and used to manipulate consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_vote()] [Serialization vulnerability] Can maliciously crafted Vote objects with oversized fields cause BCS serialization to consume excessive memory or fail, leading to DoS or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: recover_from_ledger()] [Panic condition] If get_latest_ledger_info() fails or returns corrupted data, can recover_from_ledger() panic and prevent the validator from restarting, causing permanent liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: start()] [State inconsistency] If consensus DB contains blocks from multiple epochs, can start() incorrectly mix blocks from different epochs, causing validators to diverge and create a network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: start()] [Recovery failure] If RecoveryData::new() fails and returns PartialRecoveryData, does the system safely handle this degraded state or can it lead to consensus violations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_highest_2chain_timeout_cert()] [Liveness attack] Can an attacker repeatedly save malicious timeout certificates with artificially high round numbers, forcing honest validators to skip rounds and degrading consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: save_highest_2chain_timeout_cert()] [Byzantine manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator save a forged timeout certificate that lacks proper quorum signatures, and will this invalid cert cause consensus to stall when recovered? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: retrieve_epoch_change_proof()] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker request epoch change proof for an invalid or future version, causing get_state_proof() to return incorrect validator sets and compromising consensus security? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Struct: RootInfo] [Invariant violation] Can RootInfo be constructed with mismatched commit_root_block and quorum_cert (QC certifying a different block), breaking the invariant that QC certifies the root block? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Struct: RootInfo] [Window confusion] If window_root_block is Some but points to a block at a higher round than commit_root_block, can this break the window semantics and cause execution pipeline corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Struct: RootInfo] [Certificate mismatch] Can ordered_cert and commit_cert reference different blocks, violating the invariant that ordered blocks must be committed, leading to state machine inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Struct: RootInfo] [Genesis confusion] If commit_root_block is genesis but quorum_cert is not a genesis QC, can this cause validators to accept invalid genesis transitions during epoch changes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: LedgerRecoveryData::new()] [Trusted input] Does LedgerRecoveryData blindly trust the storage_ledger parameter, or can a corrupted AptosDB return malicious ledger info that compromises consensus recovery? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: find_root_with_window()] [Block ordering] Does the sorting by (epoch, round) at line 133 guarantee topological ordering, or can blocks with the same round but different parents break the parent-child invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Function: find_root_with_window()] [Genesis generation] Can the virtual genesis block generation at lines 114-120 create a genesis block with incorrect epoch or round, causing validators to fork at epoch boundaries? (Critical)",
