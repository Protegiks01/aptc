  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Debug information leakage] Does the 'jwk' runtime name or logging expose sensitive information about validator identities or JWK state to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Version mismatch handling] If different validators run different versions of this code with incompatible message formats, can this cause consensus failures or network splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Feature flag bypass] Can feature flags controlling JWK consensus behavior be manipulated to cause validators to execute different code paths, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Runtime isolation] Is the JWK consensus runtime isolated from other validator runtimes (consensus, mempool), or can bugs in JWK consensus crash the entire validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Panic propagation] If either spawned task panics, does the panic propagate to crash the returned Runtime, or is it caught and logged leaving the validator in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Graceful shutdown] When the Runtime is dropped, is there a grace period for in-flight JWK consensus operations to complete, or are they abruptly terminated potentially losing consensus progress? (Medium)"
