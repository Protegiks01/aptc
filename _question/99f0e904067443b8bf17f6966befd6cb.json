(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: benchmark()] [Path Traversal] Does the --dependency argument properly validate and sanitize directory paths, or can an attacker use '../' sequences to traverse outside intended directories and include malicious Move files?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: benchmark()] [Input Validation] Does the argument parser properly validate that source files exist and are readable before processing, or can missing files cause denial of service through repeated error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: benchmark()] [Logic Flaw] Can an attacker provide an empty configs vector by not specifying --config, causing the default None value to be used, potentially bypassing security configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: benchmark()] [Error Handling Bypass] When run_benchmark() returns an error, does the error message printed to stdout leak sensitive path information or internal system details that could aid further attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: benchmark()] [Race Condition] If multiple benchmark processes run concurrently with the same config file, can race conditions in file creation cause data corruption or loss in the .data/.fun_data output files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [TOCTOU Attack] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between when Options::create_from_toml_file() reads the config and when it's used, allowing an attacker to swap the config file with malicious content? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Arbitrary File Write] Can an attacker control the 'out' parameter to write benchmark results to arbitrary filesystem locations like /etc/cron.d/ for privilege escalation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [File Overwrite] Does File::create(out) safely handle existing files, or can it overwrite critical system files if the output path is manipulated to point to sensitive locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Configuration Injection] Can malicious TOML in the config file exploit parsing vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary Options values that bypass security restrictions or enable dangerous features?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Integer Overflow] Can the hard_timeout_secs value of 60 be manipulated through config injection to cause integer overflow when converted to milliseconds or compared with Duration values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Timeout Bypass] Can an attacker craft Move code that causes the Boogie verifier to hang indefinitely despite the 60-second hard timeout, potentially through solver bugs or infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Race Condition] Is there a race condition between options.set_quiet() and options.setup_logging() that could cause sensitive debug information to leak to unauthorized output streams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/benchmark.rs] [Function: run_benchmark()] [Directory Traversal] When move_sources and move_deps are appended from user input, are the paths canonicalized to prevent '..' traversal attacks that could access restricted directories? (High)",
