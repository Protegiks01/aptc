  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Struct: AggregatorOverriddenStateView] [Audit trail gap] Does the override mechanism leave an audit trail showing which reads were overridden, or could malicious activity be hidden by missing logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Metrics manipulation] If the base_view tracks metrics on state reads, could the unused read at line 46 inflate metrics, causing incorrect performance analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Determinism under failures] If the system crashes between computing the override value and returning it, could recovery lead to non-deterministic state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Struct: AggregatorOverriddenStateView] [Memory safety] Although Rust is memory-safe, could FFI boundaries or unsafe blocks in dependencies cause memory corruption affecting this struct? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Compiler optimization attack] Could aggressive compiler optimizations reorder operations in ways that violate the intended semantics of the override logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Write-read conflict] If a transaction writes to TOTAL_SUPPLY_STATE_KEY and then reads it, does it see the overridden value or its own write, potentially causing transaction abortion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Snapshot isolation violation] If the override value is computed from a stale snapshot of total_supply_aggr_base_val, could this break snapshot isolation guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Transaction dependency] If multiple transactions in the same block depend on TOTAL_SUPPLY_STATE_KEY, could the override cause dependency tracking to fail, breaking parallelism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Struct: AggregatorOverriddenStateView] [Validator consensus mismatch] If some validators use this override while others don't (due to version skew), could this cause consensus failure requiring emergency coordination? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Cache coherency] If the base_view has a multi-level cache (L1, L2), could the read at line 46 and override at line 47 see different cache levels, breaking coherency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: new()] [Struct initialization] Is the struct fully initialized before being used, or could partial initialization cause undefined behavior if accessed during construction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Return value optimization] Could return value optimization (RVO) be disabled in debug builds, causing different behavior between debug and release modes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Error code semantics] If base_view returns Ok(None) for missing keys vs Err for errors, does the override preserve these semantics or could it conflate the two cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Struct: AggregatorOverriddenStateView] [Size optimization] Is the struct size optimized for cache-line alignment, or could poor layout cause false sharing in multi-core execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Branch prediction] Could the rarely-taken override branch at line 42 cause branch misprediction penalties that accumulate to performance degradation? (Low)",
