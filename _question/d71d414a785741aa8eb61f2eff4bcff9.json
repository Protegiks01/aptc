  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Static REGEX_HTML_ELEMENTS_TO_SKIP] [ReDoS] The large alternation of HTML element names - can extremely long or nested HTML-like strings cause performance issues in regex matching? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: parse_root_template()] [ReDoS] The root template parsing regex with verbose mode - can carefully crafted template content cause catastrophic backtracking in the multi-line regex matching? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_text()] [Infinite Loop] The code uses `chars.take_while_ref()` to consume characters - can certain malformed input cause the iterator to never terminate, hanging the documentation generation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_code()] [Infinite Loop] The while loop with regex captures - if REGEX_CODE matches empty strings, could this cause an infinite loop where `at` never advances? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: encode_html_entities_in_text()] [Infinite Loop] Similar to decorate_code, can empty regex matches cause the `at` variable to not advance, leading to an infinite loop? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Memory DoS] Can an attacker provide an extremely large Move codebase or deeply nested module dependencies that cause the documentation generator to consume unbounded memory in `self.output` BTreeMap? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_toc()] [Memory DoS] The table of contents is stored in `self.toc` - can extremely deep section nesting or massive numbers of sections cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_dependency_diagram()] [Memory DoS] The BFS traversal with visited set and queue - can circular or extremely large dependency graphs cause unbounded memory growth? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_call_diagram()] [Memory DoS] Similar to dependency diagrams, can recursive function call graphs cause the visited set and queue to grow without bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_text()] [Memory DoS] The `decorated_text` string is built incrementally - can extremely large documentation comments cause excessive memory allocation and string copying? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: get_source_with_indent()] [Memory DoS] When extracting source code with adjusted indentation, can very large function implementations cause excessive string allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: section_header()] [Integer Overflow] The addition `usize::saturating_add(self.options.section_level_start, level)` uses saturating arithmetic - but what happens if level itself overflows before this point? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: increment_section_nest()] [Integer Overflow] The section nest counter `*self.section_nest.borrow_mut() += 1` - can extremely deep nesting cause this counter to overflow, wrapping to 0 and breaking section level logic? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: get_source_with_indent()] [Integer Underflow] The calculation `peek_start -= 60` only checks if `peek_start > 60` - what happens if `peek_start` is exactly 60 and further operations cause underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: get_source_with_indent()] [Integer Arithmetic] The indentation calculation `source_before.len() - newl_at - 1` - can `newl_at` equal or exceed `source_before.len()`, causing integer underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: make_label_from_str()] [Label Collision] Labels are created by replacing spaces with underscores - can different section titles produce identical labels, causing navigation issues or anchor conflicts in generated documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: label_for_section()] [Label Uniqueness] Labels use a counter for uniqueness, but the counter is per-generator instance - can multiple modules with identical section titles still collide if processed in the same batch? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: make_label_for_module()] [Label Collision] Module labels replace '::' with '_' - can modules 'A::B' and 'A_B' produce identical labels, causing documentation cross-reference confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: resolve_to_label()] [Reference Resolution] The heuristic-based reference resolution may fail or produce wrong results - can this be exploited to create misleading cross-references in documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: resolve_to_label()] [AccountAddress Parsing] When parsing address literals with `AccountAddress::from_hex_literal()`, what happens if an invalid address is provided? Does `.ok()?` properly handle all edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: parse_root_template()] [Template Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious template placeholders like '{{move-include ../../../etc/passwd}}' to include arbitrary files in the generated documentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: expand_root_template()] [Undefined Behavior] When a template references an undefined module via 'move-include', the code emits '>undefined move-include' - can this be exploited to inject HTML or confuse parsers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: expand_root_template()] [TOC Duplication] The code checks `if toc_label.is_none()` but emits an error for duplicate move-toc due to CodeWriter limitations - can an attacker cause malformed documentation by including multiple TOC placeholders? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: expand_root_template()] [Section Nest Manipulation] The section nest is saved and restored when including modules - can malicious section nesting in templates cause the nest counter to become negative or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_svg_file()] [Error Handling] When the 'dot' command fails, an error is logged but execution continues - can this lead to corrupted documentation with missing diagrams that appears valid? (Low)"
