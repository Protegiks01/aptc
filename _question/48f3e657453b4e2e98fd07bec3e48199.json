  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: type_info()] [Shared reference aliasing] The method returns &TypeInfoResource which contains mutable Vec<u8> fields - can an attacker obtain multiple mutable references through unsafe code paths and cause data races when the indexer concurrently processes the same event? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: account()] [Missing validation] The getter provides direct access to the account field without validation - should there be checks to ensure the address is not a reserved system address or blacklisted address before exposing it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: type_info()] [Mutable access risk] Although the method returns an immutable reference, can an attacker use std::mem::transmute or other unsafe operations to obtain mutable access to the TypeInfoResource and modify the event data after it's been indexed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Field ordering dependency] The Serialize derive macro may serialize fields in declaration order - if the order of 'account' and 'type_info' fields changes in a future refactor, will old events become undeserializable, causing indexer failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Missing field handling] If a future version of CoinRegister adds new fields with default values, will old serialized events fail to deserialize or will they silently use defaults, potentially causing semantic differences between old and new events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information disclosure] The Debug trait implementation exposes full AccountAddress and TypeInfoResource details - can this leak sensitive information if error messages or debug logs containing CoinRegister events are exposed through public APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Size constraints] There are no size limits on TypeInfoResource fields - can an attacker emit CoinRegister events with multi-megabyte module_name or struct_name vectors that cause storage bloat in the event database? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: EventV2Translator] [Translation consistency] When CoinRegisterTranslator calls try_from_bytes() to convert V2 events to V1 events for backward compatibility, can inconsistencies in translation logic cause different indexers to have different views of coin registrations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: EventV2Translator] [State lookup failure] The translator queries AccountResource to get the event key and sequence number - if this state lookup fails or returns stale data, can it cause V1 events to have incorrect sequence numbers that break event ordering guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: EventV2Translator] [Sequence number manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the timing of CoinRegister event emission to cause sequence number collisions or gaps when translated to V1 events, potentially allowing event replay or omission attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Send/Sync safety] The struct doesn't explicitly implement Send or Sync - can this cause issues in parallel event processing where multiple threads try to deserialize and handle CoinRegister events concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Thread-local deserialization] If bcs::from_bytes() uses thread-local buffers or caches, can race conditions in the deserialization process cause different threads to deserialize the same bytes into different CoinRegister instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [Concurrent initialization] If multiple indexer threads simultaneously access COIN_REGISTER_TYPE for the first time, can the Lazy initialization be executed multiple times, potentially causing memory leaks or inconsistent TypeTag instances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Event emission ordering] If multiple CoinRegister events are emitted in a single transaction for different coin types, can the ordering be manipulated to cause the indexer to process them in the wrong order, leading to incorrect coin registration state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Transaction rollback handling] If a transaction that emits a CoinRegister event fails and rolls back, does the event still get persisted in the event log, potentially causing the indexer to track a coin registration that never actually occurred? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Event versioning] If the Move framework upgrades the account::CoinRegister event structure to add new fields, will the Rust type definition become incompatible, causing all event deserialization to fail and breaking indexer functionality? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Move Framework] [Feature flag migration] The Move framework uses feature flags to migrate from legacy CoinRegisterEvent to new CoinRegister events - can inconsistent feature flag states across validators cause some to emit V1 events and others to emit V2 events, breaking indexer consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Memory leak potential] Since TypeInfoResource contains owned Vec<u8> fields, can repeated deserialization of malicious events cause memory leaks if error paths don't properly drop the partially constructed CoinRegister structs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Stack overflow risk] Can deeply nested or recursive type structures in the BCS bytes cause stack overflow during deserialization, especially if the deserialization is recursive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Drop implementation] There's no explicit Drop implementation - can this cause resource leaks if CoinRegister instances hold resources that need explicit cleanup (e.g., file handles or network connections in future extensions)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [No validation on construction] The struct fields are public and there's no validation in try_from_bytes() beyond BCS deserialization - can an attacker create CoinRegister instances with semantically invalid data (e.g., account address of 0x0) that passes type checking but causes logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [TypeInfoResource consistency] There's no validation that the TypeInfoResource actually corresponds to a valid coin type - can an attacker register arbitrary types and cause the indexer to track non-coin types as coins? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Address format validation] AccountAddress is treated as opaque bytes - should there be validation that it's a properly formatted address (e.g., not all zeros, not exceeding maximum length) to prevent indexer corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Database injection] When the indexer stores account and type_info data extracted from CoinRegister events, can malicious characters in TypeInfoResource.module_name or struct_name cause SQL injection or NoSQL injection vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Duplicate event handling] Can an attacker cause the same CoinRegister event to be emitted multiple times (e.g., through transaction replay or block reorganization), causing the indexer to double-count coin registrations? (Medium)"
