  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Metrics Cardinality Explosion] Despite using PeerId::ZERO for the local peer, can fuzzer data cause metrics to be tagged with unbounded cardinality from other dimensions (protocols, message types), causing OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Arc Reference Cycle] Does the Arc<HashMap::new()> for upstream_handlers create any reference cycles when combined with Peer's internal Arc references that prevent proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Channel Buffer Exhaustion] With channel_size set to 8, can fuzzer data cause both connection_notifs and peer_reqs channels to fill simultaneously, creating deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Memory Ordering Issues] Are all concurrent accesses to shared state (channels, Peer internal state) properly synchronized with memory barriers, or can weak ordering cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: test_peer_fuzzers()] [Deterministic Fuzzing Limitation] Does ValueGenerator::deterministic() use a fixed seed that allows attackers to know the exact fuzzer inputs, enabling them to craft exploits that avoid detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: test_peer_fuzzers()] [Insufficient Coverage] With only 50 iterations, can critical security bugs be missed that would be found with more extensive fuzzing, especially in rarely-executed code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: test_peer_fuzzers()] [Test-Only Code Path] Does the test use different code paths than production fuzzing, potentially missing vulnerabilities that only manifest in continuous fuzzing environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [State Machine Confusion] Can fuzzer data cause the Peer to transition between states (connecting, connected, disconnecting) in invalid sequences that corrupt internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Handshake Bypass] Even though MessagingProtocolVersion::V1 is set in metadata, can fuzzer data send messages that require V2 protocol features, causing version confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Network Context Inconsistency] Can the mock NetworkContext diverge from real network state in ways that cause the Peer to make incorrect security decisions about peer authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Connection Metadata Mutation] Is ConnectionMetadata immutable once set, or can fuzzer exploits cause it to be modified during the connection lifetime, bypassing security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Async Task Cancellation] If the fuzzer is interrupted mid-execution, are all spawned async tasks properly cancelled, or can they continue running and interfere with subsequent fuzzing iterations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Future Polling Starvation] In the block_on() call waiting for notifications, can the single-threaded runtime cause starvation where the Peer task never gets polled due to notification processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Executor Clone Safety] Does executor.clone() properly handle reference counting, or can dropping the cloned executor while tasks are still running cause use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Future Join Race] In future::join(f_send, f_recv), if f_send completes but f_recv panics, is the MemorySocket left in an inconsistent state that corrupts the output buffer? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [BCS Length Prefix Manipulation] Can fuzzer data craft BCS-serialized messages with incorrect length prefixes that cause the deserializer to read beyond buffer boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [BCS Enum Variant Attack] Can fuzzer bytes specify invalid enum variant discriminants in BCS format that bypass Rust's type safety and cause undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [BCS Serialization Non-determinism] Does BCS serialization produce identical byte sequences for equivalent MultiplexMessages, or can non-determinism cause different security behaviors across fuzzing runs?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: generate_corpus()] [Unwrap Panic Masking] Do the unwrap() calls on writer.send() and read_socket.read_to_end() mask serialization errors that could indicate exploitable bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz()] [Panic Propagation] If the Peer panics during message processing, does the panic properly propagate to the fuzzer harness for detection, or is it silently caught and ignored? (High)",
