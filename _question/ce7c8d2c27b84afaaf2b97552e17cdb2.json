  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: PackageIdentity] [Empty Name] Can the name field be an empty string, null, or whitespace-only, causing package resolution to fail or match unintended packages during dependency lookup? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Path Traversal in Display] Can an attacker craft a malicious strip_root_path argument containing symlinks or traversal sequences that cause the display output to reveal absolute paths of sensitive directories? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Format String Injection] Does the Write implementation properly escape special characters in paths, node URLs, or git commits to prevent format string injection or log injection attacks when displayed in error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Path Prefix Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the strip_prefix() logic to cause incorrect path stripping by using non-canonical paths in strip_root_path that appear to match but don't actually prefix the target path? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Error Handling] If strip_prefix() fails, does the function fall back to displaying the full path, potentially leaking sensitive directory structure in error messages or logs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Display Buffer Overflow] Can extremely long paths, URLs, or commit IDs cause write buffer overflows when formatted, especially with custom Write implementations that don't bounds-check? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Unicode Display Issues] Does path display properly handle non-UTF8 paths, surrogate pairs, or right-to-left override characters that could cause display spoofing or terminal injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Function: fmt_strip_root_path()] [Git Commit Display] Does the commit_id display as full SHA-1 hash or shortened version, and can shortened display cause ambiguity about which commit is actually referenced? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd] [Ordering Inconsistency] Can the derived Ord implementation for SourceLocation create inconsistent ordering when comparing Local vs OnChain vs Git variants, breaking BTreeMap/BTreeSet invariants and causing data structure corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd] [Canonicalization Ordering] Do CanonicalPath, CanonicalNodeIdentity, and CanonicalGitIdentity guarantee that semantically equivalent locations compare equal, or can canonicalization inconsistencies cause duplicate cache entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd] [AccountAddress Ordering] Is AccountAddress ordering consistent with on-chain address comparison, or can ordering mismatches cause package resolution to select wrong versions during dependency resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Ord/PartialOrd] [Git Oid Ordering] Does Oid ordering reflect commit graph topology or just byte comparison, and can this cause incorrect package version selection in dependency resolution algorithms? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Hash Collision] Do PackageIdentity instances with same name but different locations compare as equal or different, and can this be exploited to bypass dependency pinning by substituting package locations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Canonicalization Equality] Can two SourceLocation instances representing the same actual location compare as unequal due to canonicalization failures, causing duplicate downloads or cache misses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Path Comparison] Does CanonicalPath equality properly handle case-insensitive filesystems, symlink resolution, and Unicode normalization to prevent path confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Eq/PartialEq] [Git URL Equality] Does CanonicalGitIdentity properly canonicalize URLs so that git@github.com:user/repo and https://github.com/user/repo compare as equal when referencing the same repository? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Deep Copy Safety] Does the derived Clone implementation properly deep-copy all fields including Oid and AccountAddress, or can shallow copying cause aliasing bugs where mutations affect multiple package identities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Resource Leaks] Can repeated cloning of PackageIdentity instances with large paths or URLs cause memory leaks or resource exhaustion in long-running package resolution processes? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Integration] [Serialization Safety] If PackageIdentity is serialized (e.g., for caching), can attackers inject malicious serialized data to corrupt the location field and cause code execution when packages are resolved? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Integration] [Cache Poisoning] Can attackers exploit differences between PackageIdentity equality/hashing and actual package resolution to poison caches with malicious packages that match legitimate identities? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Integration] [Dependency Confusion] Can attackers publish packages with identical names to internal dependencies, exploiting ambiguous SourceLocation resolution to cause the resolver to fetch attacker-controlled code? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Integration] [Concurrent Access] If multiple threads resolve packages simultaneously, can race conditions in SourceLocation comparison or caching cause non-deterministic package selection breaking consensus? (High)",
