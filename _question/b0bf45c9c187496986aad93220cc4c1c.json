  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Consensus Safety: Secret Mismatch] Can different validators receive different SecretSharedKey values for the same round, causing them to compute different randomness and diverge in block validation or execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Consensus Safety: Premature Dequeue] If is_fully_secret_shared() incorrectly returns true (e.g., due to race condition or corrupted state), can blocks be dequeued and executed without proper secret shares, breaking randomness security? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Consensus Safety: Determinism] Is the order of blocks in ready_prefix at line 113 deterministic across all validators? Can BTreeMap iteration order differ due to implementation details causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Network: Message Ordering] If secret share messages arrive out of order across validators, can some validators dequeue blocks while others are still waiting, causing temporary state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Network: Byzantine Flooding] Can Byzantine validators flood set_secret_shared_key() calls with invalid rounds to waste CPU on offset() lookups and HashMap operations, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Timing: Observability] Do observe_block() calls at lines 68, 106, 118 introduce timing side-channels that leak information about secret share arrival patterns to network observers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [State Consistency: Checkpoint Recovery] If a validator crashes and restarts, can the BlockQueue be recovered to a consistent state, or will pending_secret_key_rounds be lost causing blocks to stall forever? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [State Consistency: Epoch Transitions] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, are BlockQueue contents properly cleared or migrated? Can stale QueueItems from old epochs interfere with new epoch blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [State Consistency: Pruning] Is there a mechanism to remove old QueueItems that will never become ready? Can ancient pending items accumulate indefinitely causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Pending Set] If pending_secret_key_rounds is empty at construction, does is_fully_secret_shared() immediately return true? Can this bypass secret sharing entirely for certain blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Edge Case: Single Block] If a QueueItem contains only one block, are all operations (offset, set_secret_shared_key, dequeue) correct, or are there off-by-one errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Edge Case: Round 0] Does the code handle round=0 correctly in BTreeMap operations and range queries, or can round=0 cause boundary condition bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Edge Case: Duplicate Rounds in Pending] If pending_secret_key_rounds contains the same round multiple times (via HashSet properties), can this cause set_secret_shared_key() to be called multiple times for that round? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [API Misuse: Direct Queue Access] The queue() getter at line 100 exposes BTreeMap - can external code mutate this bypassing BlockQueue's logic and corrupting internal invariants? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [API Misuse: Mutable References] item_mut() at line 130 returns &mut QueueItem - can callers modify fields in ways that break BlockQueue assumptions, like changing first_round() via unsafe code? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Type Safety: SecretSharedKey] Is SecretSharedKey a zero-sized type, or does it contain actual cryptographic material? Can type confusion or transmutation cause incorrect secrets to be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Concurrency: Channel Closure] At line 73, if the channel receiver is dropped before send(), does this cause send() to fail silently? Should this be an error that prevents block dequeue? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Concurrency: DropGuard Timing] share_requester_handles contains DropGuard objects - when are these dropped, and can delayed drops cause network requests to remain active after blocks are dequeued? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/block_queue.rs] [Concurrency: Lock Ordering] If multiple mutexes are held across QueueItem, PipelinedBlock, and BlockQueue, can lock ordering violations cause deadlocks between secret sharing and consensus threads? (High)"
