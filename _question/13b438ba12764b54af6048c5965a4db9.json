  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Cycle Detection Resource Cost] Can an attacker publish modules with complex dependency graphs that cause module_cyclic_dependency_error! detection to consume excessive CPU cycles during DFS traversal before the error is raised? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Non-Deterministic Debug Output] Does the {:?} format specifier for $err at line 12 produce deterministic output across all validator nodes regardless of architecture, endianness, or Rust version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Hex Encoding Non-Determinism] Can the to_hex() method at line 29 produce different outputs on different platforms (uppercase vs lowercase hex, 0x prefix vs no prefix), causing consensus divergence when errors are compared? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [String Allocation Non-Determinism] Does the to_owned() call at line 47 always produce identical ModuleId representations across validators, or can memory allocator differences cause non-deterministic object identities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Error Comparison Non-Determinism] If validators compare VMError objects for equality to verify consensus, do the error messages from these macros always match byte-for-byte, or can format differences cause false divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Lifetime Violation] Does the macro properly handle the lifetime of $addr and $name parameters, or can use-after-free occur if these references become invalid before format!() completes at lines 10-12? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Borrow Checker Bypass] Can the dereference of $addr at line 29 (*$addr implicit in to_hex()) violate Rust's borrow checker rules if $addr is a mutable reference that's also borrowed elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Ownership Transfer Attack] When $name.to_owned() is called at line 47, does this properly transfer ownership, or can the original $name be used after ownership transfer, creating aliased mutable state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Send/Sync Violation] Are the VMError objects produced by these macros safe to send across thread boundaries (impl Send + Sync), or can thread-local data in error messages cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Error Context Loss] By using Location::Undefined at line 14 instead of capturing the actual module location, does module_storage_error! lose critical debugging context that could help identify the root cause of storage failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Timezone-Dependent Behavior] Does any part of the error message generation depend on system locale or timezone, potentially causing non-deterministic error strings across validators in different regions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Stack Overflow via Deep Cycles] Can module_cyclic_dependency_error! be triggered from within deeply nested module resolution, causing stack overflow when the error unwinds through many recursive frames? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Error Recovery Bypass] Can catch_unwind be used to intercept errors from these macros, allowing malicious code to suppress critical errors and continue execution in an invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Error Serialization Size Bomb] Can the error messages generated by format!() be crafted to be extremely large (e.g., via long module names), causing excessive bandwidth usage when errors are serialized and transmitted between nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Storage Backend Confusion] Can different storage backends return errors in different formats that, when passed to $err:ident at line 12, cause inconsistent error messages across validators using different storage implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Module Name Unicode Exploits] Can Unicode normalization differences in $name cause the same logical module name to produce different error messages, breaking error-based deduplication or caching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Error Location Spoofing] Can the Location::Module constructed at lines 46-48 be manipulated to point to a different module than the one that actually caused the cycle, misdirecting blame? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Panic Safety] If any of the method calls within these macros (to_hex(), to_owned(), format!()) panic, is the VM left in a valid state, or can partial error construction corrupt VM state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Async Context Corruption] When module_storage_error! is invoked from async storage operations, can context switching during error construction cause the wrong module address/name to be captured in the error message? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Canonicalization Attack] Before calling to_hex() at line 29, is the address canonicalized, or can non-canonical address representations cause the same module to have different error representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [ModuleId Cache Poisoning] When ModuleId::new() is called at line 47, does this interact with any global module ID cache, and can error construction poison the cache with invalid entries? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Macro Hygiene Violation] Can name collisions in macro expansion cause variables like 'move_binary_format' or 'move_core_types' to be shadowed, potentially calling wrong error constructors? (Low)"
