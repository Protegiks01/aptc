  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Endpoint Confusion] Multiple endpoints are registered (/spec.json, /spec.yaml, /mint) - can path traversal or URL encoding tricks cause request routing to wrong handlers bypassing security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Mint Endpoint Bypass] At line 217, /mint endpoint gets fund_api_components directly - does this bypass any checker or bypasser logic that the OpenAPI routes enforce? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [API Path Traversal] The api_path_base at line 210 is configurable - can setting it to '..' or other special paths expose internal routes or bypass path-based access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Middleware Bypass] The middleware_log is applied at line 219 - can crafted requests bypass logging to hide attack patterns from security monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [OpenAPI Schema Exposure] Spec endpoints at lines 215-216 expose API schema - does this reveal sensitive internal structure, rate limits, or bypass mechanisms attackers can exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Task Panic Propagation] At line 232, join_next().await.unwrap().unwrap() double-unwraps - if a periodic task panics, does it properly shutdown the server or leave it in an undefined state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Task Spawn Failure] If checker.spawn_periodic_tasks() fails silently, can the server run without critical background tasks, leading to security check bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Resource Leak] If JoinSet tasks are spawned but never properly cleaned up on server shutdown, can this leak memory or file descriptors over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Task Starvation] If one checker spawns CPU-intensive periodic tasks, can it starve other tasks or the main request handling loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Port Hijacking] At lines 195-198, the server binds to listen_address and listen_port - can an attacker race to bind the same port if server restarts, intercepting faucet traffic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Port Information Leak] At lines 202-204, the actual bound port is sent through a channel - can this channel be intercepted or does it leak port information to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_and_report_port()] [Channel Failure] If port_tx.send() fails at line 203, the error is simply mapped to anyhow - does this properly handle the failure case or silently continue with undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Bind Address Wildcard] If listen_address is set to '0.0.0.0', can external attackers access the faucet if firewall rules are misconfigured? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Future Selection Race] At lines 237-240, select_all waits for futures that should never end - can subtle race conditions cause one future to complete unexpectedly without proper cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Metrics Server Failure] If metrics_server_config.disable is false but the metrics server fails to start, does it crash the entire faucet or continue without metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [API Server Panic] If the API server panics during request handling, is the panic caught and logged, or does it bring down the entire server process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_impl()] [Future Ordering] The main_futures Vec can have 2-3 futures - does execution order matter, and can an attacker trigger specific ordering to exploit race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: run_test()] [Test Mode Leakage] At lines 245-248, run_test modifies config for testing - can this test mode be accidentally enabled in production, disabling metrics and using test ports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [Default Amount Hardcoding] At line 304, amount_to_fund is hardcoded to 100_000_000_000 - can this excessive amount be exploited if used in production to drain funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [Chain ID Confusion] At line 283, chain_id defaults to ChainId::test if not provided - can this cause testnet keys to be used on mainnet or vice versa? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [No Bypass Protection] At lines 276-277, bypasser_configs and checker_configs are empty Vecs - does this create a completely unprotected faucet vulnerable to unlimited draining? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/run.rs] [Function: build_for_cli()] [Gas Parameters] At lines 288-290, gas parameters are hardcoded - can these values be manipulated to cause transactions to fail or succeed maliciously? (Medium)",
