  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Type Safety] Can a malicious PrePartitioner implementation return mismatched vector lengths between ori_idxs_by_pre_partitioned, start_txn_idxs_by_shard, and pre_partitioned, causing out-of-bounds access or panics during execution that halt the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [State Corruption] Can an implementation return duplicate OriginalTxnIdx values in the first return vector, causing the same transaction to be executed multiple times and leading to double-spending or state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Transaction Loss] Can a malicious implementation omit certain transaction indices from the returned vectors, causing transactions to be dropped silently without execution or validation, potentially losing user funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Integer Overflow] If ori_idxs_by_pre_partitioned contains indices >= state.num_txns(), can this cause integer overflow or out-of-bounds access when indexing into transaction arrays in subsequent processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Determinism] Since PrePartitioner implementations must be deterministic across all validators, can non-deterministic behavior (e.g., HashMap iteration order) cause validators to partition blocks differently, leading to consensus failure and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Shard Imbalance] Can a malicious implementation assign all transactions to a single shard in pre_partitioned, creating extreme load imbalance that degrades validator performance and causes liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Empty Shards] Can returning empty vectors for some shards in pre_partitioned cause null pointer exceptions or undefined behavior in downstream parallel execution logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [Trait: PrePartitioner::pre_partition()] [Index Reordering] If start_txn_idxs_by_shard is not monotonically increasing, can this violate assumptions in the partition state and cause incorrect dependency tracking or transaction ordering?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Group Size Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions to create a single massive connected component exceeding group_size_limit, causing the partitioner to create an unbounded number of groups and trigger OOM conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Division by Zero] If num_executor_shards is 0, will the group_size_limit calculation cause division by zero and panic the validator during block partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Float to Int Conversion] Can the ceil() conversion in group_size_limit calculation overflow usize on 32-bit systems when processing extremely large blocks, causing memory corruption?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [VecDeque Underflow] When pop_front() is called on txns_by_set, can an accounting error cause more pops than pushes, leading to panic and validator crash during block processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Load Imbalance Tolerance] Can setting load_imbalance_tolerance to extreme values (e.g., 0.0 or 1000.0) bypass intended constraints and create pathological partitioning that degrades consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Determinism Violation] Since union-find results are noted as non-deterministic, can this cause different validators to produce different partitions for the same block, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/mod.rs] [ConnectedComponent Implementation] [Registry Collision] Can hash collisions in set_idx_registry cause different union-find sets to map to the same set_idx, merging unrelated transaction groups and violating conflict isolation?
