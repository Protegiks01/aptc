  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [String Constant Security] Could the MODULE_IDENTIFIER constant 'chain_id' be manipulated or spoofed during on-chain config fetching to retrieve incorrect chain ID values, potentially enabling cross-chain replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [String Constant Security] Could the TYPE_IDENTIFIER constant 'ChainId' collide with other on-chain resources, causing the wrong data to be deserialized as ChainId during fetch_config operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Access Path Construction] Does the combination of MODULE_IDENTIFIER and TYPE_IDENTIFIER uniquely identify the ChainId resource, or could a malicious contract create a conflicting resource at the same path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Deserialization] Since ChainId uses the default deserialize_into_config implementation, could malformed BCS bytes at the on-chain storage location cause deserialization to succeed with an invalid chain ID value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [State Key Generation] Could the StateKey::on_chain_config::<ChainId>() call fail or return an incorrect key due to the MODULE_IDENTIFIER or TYPE_IDENTIFIER being invalid identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Default Address] Since OnChainConfig uses ADDRESS = '0x1' by default, is there any scenario where ChainId could be fetched from a non-system address, bypassing governance controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Struct Tag Construction] Could the struct_tag_for_config function generate an invalid or ambiguous StructTag for ChainId, leading to incorrect resource resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/chain_id.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Module Identifier Validation] Are the string constants 'chain_id' and 'ChainId' validated to be valid Move identifiers, or could they contain characters that break the type system? (Low)"
