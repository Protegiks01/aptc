  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Information Disclosure] Can NUM_META_DOWNLOAD values be used by an attacker to infer backup schedules, network bandwidth, or storage locations, aiding in planning targeted attacks on backup infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Error Handling] If the Prometheus registry is corrupted or in an invalid state, can the .unwrap() in NUM_META_FILES initialization cause a panic that prevents all backup operations from starting, creating a total backup system outage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Error Handling] Does NUM_META_MISS initialization properly handle scenarios where metric registration fails due to resource exhaustion, or will it panic and prevent backup operations from recovering gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Error Handling] If metric registration for NUM_META_DOWNLOAD fails during high-load scenarios with many concurrent backup operations, can the panic propagate and crash the entire backup-cli process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Integration Bug] In the sync_and_load function where NUM_META_FILES is set, can race conditions between metric updates and actual file synchronization cause metrics to reflect stale or incorrect backup state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Integration Bug] Can manipulation of the local cache directory between when NUM_META_MISS is set and when files are downloaded cause metrics to diverge from actual backup operations, masking security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Integration Bug] Since NUM_META_DOWNLOAD is incremented in a concurrent buffered stream, can dropped futures or cancelled downloads cause the metric to undercount actual download attempts, hiding resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Global State] Can the use of static Lazy initialization for NUM_META_FILES cause issues when backup-cli is used as a library in other contexts, potentially leading to unexpected metric sharing across logically separate backup operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Global State] Does the global static nature of NUM_META_MISS cause problems in test environments where multiple test cases might manipulate the same metric concurrently, leading to flaky tests that mask real bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Global State] Can the static lifetime of NUM_META_DOWNLOAD cause metrics to persist across multiple backup operations in the same process, leading to cumulative values that don't reflect individual backup job health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Type Confusion] Can the choice of IntGauge (allowing negative values via i64) for NUM_META_FILES lead to confusion or bugs when interacting with code that expects only positive file counts, potentially causing incorrect backup validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Type Confusion] Is it semantically correct to use IntGauge for NUM_META_MISS which should only increase during a sync operation, or should this be an IntCounter to prevent accidental decrements that would corrupt monitoring data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Type Confusion] Should NUM_META_DOWNLOAD be a gauge that can be set and incremented, or should it be strictly a counter, and can this ambiguity lead to bugs where the metric is reset inappropriately? (Low)"
