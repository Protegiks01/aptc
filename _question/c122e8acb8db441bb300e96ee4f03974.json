  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Struct: AptosPackageHooks] [Access Control] Can the global package hooks registered via register_package_hooks() be replaced or overridden by malicious code during test execution, potentially allowing test cases to bypass package validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: custom_package_info_fields()] [Metadata Manipulation] Does returning only UPGRADE_POLICY_CUSTOM_FIELD allow test packages to omit critical security metadata fields, potentially enabling tests that bypass production upgrade policy enforcement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: custom_dependency_key()] [Dependency Confusion] Can the hardcoded 'aptos' custom dependency key be exploited to inject malicious dependencies that masquerade as official Aptos packages in test environments that mirror production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: resolve_custom_dependency()] [Error Handling] Does the unconditional bail!('not used') error in resolve_custom_dependency() mask legitimate dependency resolution failures, potentially hiding attacks where malicious packages are substituted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: resolve_custom_dependency()] [Logic Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the fact that resolve_custom_dependency() always errors to force fallback dependency resolution paths that bypass security checks intended for custom Aptos dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Trait Implementation: PackageHooks] [Interface Violation] Does AptosPackageHooks correctly implement all safety-critical methods from the PackageHooks trait, or can missing validations in custom_package_info_fields() allow malformed package metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Global State] [Race Condition] Is the package hooks registration thread-safe when multiple test harnesses are created concurrently, or can race conditions in register_package_hooks() cause one test's hooks to interfere with another? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: harness] [Test Escape] Does exporting the entire harness module publicly allow production code to accidentally use test-only execution environments, potentially bypassing consensus, gas metering, or signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: stake] [Privilege Escalation] Can the publicly exported stake testing utilities be misused to create validators with manipulated stake amounts or voting power in test environments that affect production deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: aptos_governance] [Governance Bypass] Does exporting aptos_governance testing utilities allow test code to bypass multi-sig requirements, voting periods, or stake-weighted voting in governance proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: custom_package_info_fields()] [Field Injection] Can an attacker modify UPGRADE_POLICY_CUSTOM_FIELD at runtime before custom_package_info_fields() is called to inject additional custom fields that bypass package compatibility checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: custom_dependency_key()] [String Manipulation] Is the returned 'aptos' string properly validated by callers, or can Unicode homoglyphs or whitespace manipulation create dependency keys that appear identical but bypass security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Struct: AptosPackageHooks] [State Persistence] Are package hooks intended to be stateless, or can accumulated state in AptosPackageHooks across multiple package builds lead to validation inconsistencies or cache poisoning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Global Registration] [Singleton Violation] Can multiple AptosPackageHooks instances be registered simultaneously through register_package_hooks(), causing non-deterministic behavior where different packages see different validation rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module: tests] [Test Isolation] Does the conditional compilation of the tests module (cfg[test]) ensure complete isolation, or can production builds accidentally include test utilities that weaken security invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: resolve_custom_dependency()] [Parameter Validation] Are the _dep_name and _info parameters properly validated before the bail!() call, or can malformed inputs cause panics that crash the package builder? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Trait: PackageHooks] [Version Compatibility] Can mismatches between the PackageHooks trait version and AptosPackageHooks implementation cause silent failures where security-critical hook methods are never called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: aggregator] [Concurrency Bugs] Does exporting aggregator testing utilities allow creation of aggregators that bypass snapshot isolation or parallel execution safety guarantees in Block-STM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: aggregator_v2] [Version Confusion] Can exporting both aggregator and aggregator_v2 modules simultaneously cause version confusion where tests mixing v1 and v2 APIs produce results inconsistent with production behavior? (Medium)",
