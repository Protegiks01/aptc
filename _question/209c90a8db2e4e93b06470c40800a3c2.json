  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [Function: load_bcs_file()] [Time-based attack] Can an attacker manipulate timestamps in BCS-encoded transactions to cause them to be replayed in different epochs or enable double-spending across time boundaries? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [All functions] [Partial restoration] Can an attacker cause some backup files to load successfully while others fail, leading to inconsistent partial state that violates blockchain invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [Function: load_bcs_file()] [Gas price manipulation] Can BCS backups containing historical gas prices be manipulated to show artificially low prices, enabling attackers to spam the network with underpriced transactions after restore? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/storage_ext.rs] [Function: read_all()] [Network partition] Can slow or intermittent storage backends cause read_all() operations to timeout inconsistently across validators, leading to divergent state and network partition? (High)",
