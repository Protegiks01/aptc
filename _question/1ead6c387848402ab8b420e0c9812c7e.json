  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: round()] [Round Consistency] Does round() (lines 94-96) always return the same value as ledger_info.commit_info.round(), or could they diverge causing consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: round()] [Integer Overflow] Can the round number overflow or wrap around, and would this cause CommitVotes from different epochs to be considered for the same round? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch Validation] Does epoch() (lines 98-100) validate that the epoch matches the current validator set, or could stale CommitVotes from previous epochs be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch Transition] During epoch transitions, can CommitVotes with mismatched epochs cause votes to be aggregated with wrong validator verifier, breaking quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Author Validation] In verify() (lines 104-114), the author check (lines 105-110) compares self.author() == sender - can this be bypassed if author is AccountAddress::ZERO or another special value? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the error message 'Commit vote author {:?} doesn't match with the sender {:?}' leak information about internal validator states that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Optimistic Verification Bypass] When calling validator.optimistic_verify() (line 112), if optimistic_sig_verification flag is true but the signature is invalid, is set_verified() called prematurely? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Pessimistic Verify Set] If a validator is in pessimistic_verify_set, their signatures are verified individually - can a Byzantine validator exploit this by submitting one bad vote to trigger individual verification, then flood with invalid votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature Verification Race] Between checking author==sender and calling optimistic_verify(), could the signature_with_status be modified by another thread, causing TOCTOU vulnerability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [ValidatorVerifier State] Does verify() ensure the ValidatorVerifier is from the correct epoch, or could an attacker use a validator from an old epoch to verify votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Context Propagation] Does the .context() call (line 113) properly propagate all error information, or could nested verification errors be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Return Type Safety] Does verify() returning anyhow::Result allow callers to ignore errors with .ok() or .unwrap_or_default(), potentially accepting unverified votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Double Verification] If verify() is called multiple times on the same CommitVote, does optimistic_verify() skip redundant checks based on verification_status, and could this allow bypassing verification if status is manually set? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Public Key Lookup] Does optimistic_verify() check if author exists in validator set before verification, or could unknown authors cause panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: commit_info()] [Reference Validity] Does commit_info() (lines 116-118) return a reference that remains valid, or could the underlying BlockInfo be modified through interior mutability? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Function: commit_info()] [BlockInfo Consistency] Can the commit_info() BlockInfo be inconsistent with the ledger_info fields, causing state divergence in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Impl: Display] [Information Disclosure] Does the Display implementation (lines 33-42) expose sensitive information like validator addresses that could aid network-level attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Impl: Debug] [Log Injection] Can malicious CommitVote data inject control characters or escape sequences through Debug formatting that corrupt logs or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization Consistency] Does Serde serialization of CommitVote (line 18) include the verification_status from SignatureWithStatus, potentially leaking internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Deserialization Attack] Can a malicious node craft serialized CommitVote data with invalid field combinations that deserialize successfully but cause panics later? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone Semantics] When CommitVote is cloned (line 18), does the SignatureWithStatus Arc<AtomicBool> get shared, allowing clones to affect each other's verification status? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality Check] Does PartialEq ignore verification_status (as it should), and could two CommitVotes with same signature but different verification status be treated as equal incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Integration: ValidatorVerifier] [Optimistic Verification] When optimistic_verify is called on a CommitVote, if optimistic_sig_verification flag is false, does it fall back to immediate verification, and could toggling this flag cause security issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Integration: ValidatorVerifier] [Aggregation Failure] If multiple CommitVotes are aggregated and one has an invalid signature, does the entire aggregation fail or just the bad vote get filtered, and could this be exploited for DoS? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/pipeline/commit_vote.rs] [Integration: ValidatorVerifier] [Public Key Mismatch] Can a CommitVote be created where the author's public key doesn't match the validator set, and would this only be caught during verification or earlier? (High)"
