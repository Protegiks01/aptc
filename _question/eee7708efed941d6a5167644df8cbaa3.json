  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Type Confusion] Can type confusion during deserialization allow non-string types to be assigned to magic_header_key or magic_header_value fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty String] What happens if magic_header_value is configured as an empty string - does the comparison still work correctly, or can any request with the key pass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Very Long Keys] Can attackers exploit extremely long header key names that exceed internal buffer limits or cause truncation in the HeaderMap lookup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Binary Data] Can binary data or non-UTF8 sequences in header values cause parsing errors, crashes, or comparison bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Case Folding] Do different Unicode case folding rules (Turkish i problem) create comparison inconsistencies that allow bypass attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Return Type] Does returning Ok(vec![]) at line 51 for success properly signal that validation passed, or could this be misinterpreted by caller code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Multiple Rejections] Can the checker return multiple RejectionReasons in the same response, and if so, does this leak additional information to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Error vs Rejection] Is there proper distinction between errors (returned as AptosTapError) and rejections (returned as Ok(Vec<RejectionReason>)), and can this be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Async Cancellation] Is the async check() function cancellation-safe, or can task cancellation leave the checker in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Await Points] Are there any .await points where attackers could exploit race conditions or timing windows to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Interface Compliance] Does the implementation properly fulfill the CheckerTrait contract, or can interface violations lead to unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Dry Run Mode] Is the _dry_run parameter properly ignored (as indicated by the underscore prefix), or could it affect validation logic and create bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Data Exposure] Does the CheckerData parameter expose sensitive information that could be leaked through the RejectionReason messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Header Lifetime] Is the Arc<HeaderMap> properly reference-counted to prevent use-after-free when headers are accessed across async boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Comparison Operator] Does the != operator at line 42 use the correct comparison semantics for the header value type, or could custom Eq implementations create vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Reference Comparison] Is the comparison done by value or by reference, and could attackers exploit pointer/reference equality to bypass the check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Defense in Depth] Is the magic header checker the only security control, or is it part of a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple independent checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Principle of Least Privilege] Does the checker have access only to the headers it needs, or can it access broader request context that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Fail Secure] If the checker encounters an unexpected error, does it fail closed (reject the request) or fail open (allow the request), potentially draining the faucet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone implementation create deep copies of sensitive data, or can cloned configs share references that enable cross-request data leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Serialization] Does the Serialize implementation expose sensitive magic_header_value in serialized output that could be logged or transmitted insecurely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Config Injection] Can attackers influence the config file or environment variables used to load the magic header values during service startup? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: new()] [Config Validation] Does new() perform sufficient validation of the config parameter, or can invalid configs be passed that create checkers in exploitable states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Framework Quirks] Can differences in how the Poem HTTP framework handles headers vs standard HTTP parsers create bypass opportunities? (Medium)",
