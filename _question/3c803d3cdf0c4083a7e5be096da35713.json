(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_state_checkpoint_output()] [State inconsistency] Can the lack of atomicity between setting state_checkpoint_output and validating its consistency with execution_output allow attackers to inject mismatched state data, causing validators to diverge on state roots?
