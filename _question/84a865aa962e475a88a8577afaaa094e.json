  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Smart contract dependency] Could Move smart contracts that depend on CurrentTimeMicroseconds for time-locked operations be exploited if timestamp validation fails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Struct: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Debug exposure] Does the Debug implementation expose internal timestamp representation details that could reveal consensus timing information useful for attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Struct: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Test backdoor] Could test-only code paths that modify CurrentTimeMicroseconds accidentally be compiled into production builds, allowing runtime timestamp manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Struct: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Feature flag bypass] If feature flags control timestamp validation, could attackers exploit transitions between enabled/disabled states to inject invalid timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Genesis timestamp] Could the initial CurrentTimeMicroseconds value set at genesis be zero or invalid, causing the first block validation to fail or accept any timestamp? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Uninitialized read] Before the Move module initializes CurrentTimeMicroseconds, could uninitialized reads return garbage values that break consensus if validators have different uninitialized states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Double initialization] Could an attacker trigger multiple initializations of CurrentTimeMicroseconds to reset time back to genesis, causing massive consensus disruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Type migration] If CurrentTimeMicroseconds is upgraded to a larger integer type (u128) in a future protocol version, could migration logic incorrectly convert timestamps causing time to jump or regress? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Struct: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Field addition] If new fields are added to CurrentTimeMicroseconds struct in an upgrade, could deserialization fail for old-format timestamps causing consensus splits between upgraded and non-upgraded validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Backward compatibility] When downgrading to older protocol versions, could CurrentTimeMicroseconds values from newer versions be misinterpreted, causing incorrect timestamp validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Clock skew exploitation] Could Byzantine validators exploit clock skew between honest validators by proposing blocks with timestamps that some honest nodes accept and others reject? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Fast-forward attack] Could an attacker fast-forward CurrentTimeMicroseconds far into the future, then prevent any new blocks from being proposed because all validators' local clocks are 'behind' the blockchain time? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [State sync timing] During state sync, could a syncing validator accept historical blocks with timestamps that appear valid but violate monotonicity when considered with missing blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Randomness seed] If CurrentTimeMicroseconds is used as a seed for VRF-based leader election, could timestamp manipulation bias leader selection toward Byzantine validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Nonce derivation] Could timestamps be manipulated to cause nonce collisions in cryptographic operations that depend on time-based uniqueness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Field: microseconds] [Entropy source] If microseconds values are used as an entropy source for cryptographic operations, could predictable timestamps reduce randomness and enable attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [MEV exploitation] Could validators manipulate CurrentTimeMicroseconds to maximize MEV extraction from time-dependent DeFi protocols without violating consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Censorship via time] Could validators censor time-sensitive transactions by manipulating timestamps to make those transactions appear expired before inclusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timestamp.rs] [Type: CurrentTimeMicroseconds] [Gas price manipulation] If gas prices adjust based on timestamps, could timestamp manipulation be used to manipulate fee markets for validator profit? (Medium)"
