  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: unauthenticated()] [Authentication Bypass] If a security-critical operation incorrectly uses unauthenticated() at line 171 instead of permission_denied(), can an attacker exploit the semantic difference to bypass access controls in the Aptos Framework? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: permission_denied()] [Authorization Confusion] Can an attacker exploit HTTP status code mapping (line 129 comment) to confuse API error reporting with internal VM errors, causing security-critical permission violations to be logged as benign 403 errors?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Conversion Chain: PanicError → VMError] [Location Undefined] At line 59, finish(Location::Undefined) loses all location information. Can this make it impossible to debug consensus bugs caused by malicious transactions targeting specific modules? (Medium)",
