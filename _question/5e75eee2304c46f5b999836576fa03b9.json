  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Unicode normalization bypass] Can an attacker craft Unicode characters that appear identical to ASCII letters but bypass the is_ascii_alphabetic() check, allowing malicious package names that look legitimate but contain hidden Unicode characters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Empty string validation] Does the validation properly reject empty strings, or can an attacker create a PackageName with zero-length string that passes validation and causes downstream parsing failures or system package collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Length limit bypass] Is there any maximum length validation for package names, or can an attacker create extremely long package names (e.g., millions of characters) that cause memory exhaustion, storage bloat, or buffer overflow in downstream systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Whitespace injection] Can an attacker include leading/trailing whitespace or internal whitespace that passes validation but causes package name collisions or parsing errors in manifest files or storage systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Null byte injection] Does the validation check for null bytes (\\\\0) within the package name string, or can an attacker inject null bytes that truncate the name in C/FFI boundaries, causing security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Homoglyph attack] Can attackers use visually similar ASCII characters (like 'l' vs '1', 'O' vs '0') to create package names that impersonate legitimate system packages (e.g., 'Aptos' vs 'Apt0s'), potentially leading to package confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Case sensitivity bypass] Since validation only checks character types without normalizing case, can an attacker exploit case-insensitive file systems to create colliding packages (e.g., 'Aptos' vs 'aptos' vs 'APTOS') that overwrite each other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Control character injection] Does the validation explicitly reject ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F), or can attackers inject carriage returns, line feeds, or other control codes that corrupt manifest files or enable injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Path traversal components] Can an attacker create package names containing path traversal sequences (e.g., '..', '.', '../../../') using allowed characters that could exploit downstream file system operations when packages are cached or stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Reserved name collision] Does the validation prevent use of operating system reserved names (e.g., 'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL' on Windows) that could cause file system errors or security issues when packages are stored locally? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [System package impersonation] Is there any check preventing attackers from using names that collide with critical Aptos framework packages (e.g., 'aptos_framework', 'aptos_std'), potentially enabling package shadowing or supply chain attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Special prefix abuse] Can attackers create packages starting with system-reserved prefixes (e.g., '__aptos_', 'aptos_internal_') that might bypass access controls or be treated as privileged system packages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Hyphen-only names] Can the validation be bypassed with package names consisting only of hyphens and underscores (e.g., '---', '___'), which might cause parsing errors or conflicts with command-line argument parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Consecutive special characters] Does validation allow unlimited consecutive hyphens or underscores (e.g., 'package----name', 'pkg__________name'), which could be used for obfuscation or to create visual confusion in package listings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [UTF-8 encoding vulnerability] Since chars() iterates over Unicode scalar values, can an attacker provide invalid UTF-8 sequences that are normalized differently by different parsers, causing validation bypass or deserialization inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Type confusion attack] Can an attacker provide non-string serialized data (e.g., integers, arrays, objects) that bypasses validation when String::deserialize() is called, potentially causing type confusion or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Error message information leak] Does the custom error message reveal internal validation logic or file paths that could assist attackers in crafting validation bypass attacks or reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Inconsistent validation] Does deserialization use the exact same is_valid_package_name() validation as the new() constructor, or is there any code path where validation could be skipped or differ, causing security inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Panic on large input] Can deserializing extremely large strings (gigabytes) cause stack overflow or panic before validation runs, leading to denial of service when processing untrusted manifest files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Allocation bomb] Can an attacker craft a serialized package name that causes excessive memory allocation in String::deserialize() before validation checks run, enabling memory exhaustion attacks against validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Unicode normalization inconsistency] If different nodes use different Unicode normalization forms (NFC vs NFD), can the same package name deserialize differently across validators, causing consensus failures or state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Into<String> bypass] Can attackers exploit the generic Into<String> parameter to provide types that bypass validation, such as Cow<str> or custom types that implement Into<String> with malicious conversion logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Error detail exposure] Does the bail! macro in the error path expose the invalid package name in error messages that could leak sensitive information or assist in validation bypass attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Race condition in validation] If new() is called concurrently with the same string from multiple threads, could there be race conditions in String allocation or validation that cause inconsistent results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Normalization bypass] Since validation doesn't normalize the string, can an attacker provide pre-composed vs decomposed Unicode that appears different to users but identical to the file system, enabling shadowing attacks?
