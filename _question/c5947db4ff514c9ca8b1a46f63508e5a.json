  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: serialize()] [None serialization] When serialize returns Ok(None), does this properly abort the transaction, or can it cause partial state updates where some changes persist and others don't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_destroy_empty_box()] [TODO comment security] The TODO on line 628 suggests uncertainty about table creation - can this indicate a potential bypass where tables are destroyed without proper initialization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [None deserialization] When deserialize returns Ok(None), can this cause uninitialized or corrupted values to be used, leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
