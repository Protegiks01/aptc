  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: new_committed_state_snapshot()] [State Integrity] Can an attacker provide mismatched events and transactions vectors with different lengths to create inconsistent CommittedStateSnapshot objects that corrupt state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: new_committed_state_snapshot()] [Integer Overflow] Can last_committed_state_index overflow when incremented repeatedly, causing the state index to wrap around and potentially overwrite earlier state snapshots? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: new_committed_state_snapshot()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker supply a version parameter that is lower than last_committed_state_index, creating temporal inconsistencies in the committed state that break causality guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Race Condition] Are concurrent calls to handle_transaction_notification with different latest_synced_version values properly serialized, or can race conditions cause notifications to be sent out of order to mempool/storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Partial Failure] If storage_service notification succeeds but mempool notification fails, does the system enter an inconsistent state where storage is updated but mempool still contains stale transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Notification Ordering] Can the order of notifications (storage first at line 98, mempool second at line 103, events third at line 108) be exploited to create temporal inconsistencies where mempool sees transactions before storage is committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Event Subscription Lock] Does acquiring the event_subscription_service lock at line 109 create a deadlock risk if another thread holds the lock while waiting for storage/mempool notifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Version Mismatch] Can latest_synced_version be inconsistent with the version embedded in latest_synced_ledger_info, allowing notifications with mismatched version/ledger_info pairs?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: handle_transaction_notification()] [Empty Transaction Vector] What happens if transactions vector is empty but events vector is non-empty - can this create inconsistent state where events exist without corresponding transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: CommitNotificationListener::new()] [Channel Unbounded] Does the unbounded mpsc channel at line 125 allow an attacker to flood the system with commit notifications, causing memory exhaustion and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Stream Termination] Can an attacker trigger premature stream termination by closing the sender, causing the commit notification system to halt and preventing state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Notification Loss] If poll_next returns Poll::Pending, are notifications properly buffered, or can rapid sender activity cause notification loss during async polling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: new_with_target()] [Target Validation] Does new_with_target perform any validation on the sync_target_notification parameter, or can malicious consensus nodes inject arbitrary invalid targets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/notification_handlers.rs] [Function: new_with_duration()] [Time Manipulation] Can start_time be manipulated to be in the future, causing duration-based sync requests to never be satisfied and blocking consensus indefinitely? (High)",
