  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Network: Connection Timeout] [Timeout Handling] Are there implicit timeouts in the handshake process, or can an attacker cause indefinite blocking by not sending expected responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Network: Backpressure] [Write Blocking] If the underlying socket experiences backpressure, can this cause the WriteState machine to block indefinitely? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Network: Connection Reset] [Abnormal Termination] When a connection is reset mid-stream, do the read and write state machines properly detect this and clean up resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Trust: Peer Addition] [Dynamic Trust] If peers are added to trusted_peers during active handshakes, can this cause authentication inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Trust: Peer Removal] [Revocation] If a peer is removed from trusted_peers while connections are active, are existing connections properly terminated? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Trust: Trust Level] [Trust Propagation] Does the trust level returned from upgrade_inbound() accurately reflect the peer's authentication status, or can it be misinterpreted? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Trust: Multiple Keys] [Key Confusion] If a peer has multiple keys in its key set, can an attacker use key confusion to authenticate as that peer with a different key? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Config: NoiseConfig] [Config Sharing] Is NoiseConfig shared across multiple connections, and if so, could this cause race conditions or state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Config: Auth Mode] [Mode Mismatch] Can a client using Mutual auth mode connect to a server using MaybeMutual mode, and does this create any security issues? (Medium)"
