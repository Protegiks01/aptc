  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [VM initialization] Does each command execution initialize a fresh Move VM instance, or is VM state shared across commands within the same CLI session? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [BuildConfig tampering] The flattened build_config at line 43-44 contains many sub-options - can an attacker manipulate compiler flags, optimization levels, or feature flags to inject vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Config propagation] Is the same build_config instance safely reused across multiple command executions, or can modifications in one command affect subsequent commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Empty natives vector] What happens if natives is an empty Vec - do commands handle this gracefully, or can missing native functions cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Empty genesis] Can an empty or minimal genesis ChangeSet cause issues in test execution or other commands that assume certain system modules are initialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_cli()] [Argument length limits] Are there maximum lengths enforced on command-line arguments to prevent buffer overflow or resource exhaustion in argument parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Unicode handling] Do file paths and identifiers properly handle Unicode characters, or can specially crafted Unicode paths cause parsing errors or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [TODO gas metering] The TODO comment at lines 78-80 explicitly states gas metering is 'a bit of a mess' with inconsistencies between sandbox and unit tests - can this be exploited to hide DoS vulnerabilities or gas griefing attacks that pass tests but fail in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Legacy CostTable] The TODO mentions 'still using the old CostTable' - are there security implications from using deprecated gas metering that might have known vulnerabilities or inaccuracies? (Medium)"
