## Title
Database Schema Mismatch Causes Incomplete Deletion of V2 Batches Leading to Unbounded Database Growth

## Summary
The `update_certified_timestamp` method in QuorumStore's batch store only deletes expired batches from the V1 database schema, failing to delete V2 batches from the separate V2 column family. When `enable_batch_v2` is enabled, this causes permanent accumulation of expired V2 batches, leading to unbounded storage growth and validator node performance degradation.

## Finding Description
The Aptos consensus layer uses QuorumStore to manage transaction batches with two separate database schemas stored in distinct column families: V1 using `BatchSchema` in the "batch" column family, and V2 using `BatchV2Schema` in the "batch_v2" column family. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

These schemas store different batch formats: `PersistedValue<BatchInfo>` for V1 and `PersistedValue<BatchInfoExt>` for V2, persisted through separate database methods.

When V2 batches are enabled via the `enable_batch_v2` configuration flag, batches are created using the V2 format and saved to the "batch_v2" column family. [3](#0-2) 

During normal consensus operation, the `update_certified_timestamp` method is called on every block commit to clean up expired batches: [4](#0-3) 

**The Critical Bug:** While `update_certified_timestamp` correctly clears expired batches from the in-memory cache, it only deletes them from the V1 database schema: [5](#0-4) 

The `delete_batches` method operates exclusively on the `BatchSchema` (V1) column family: [6](#0-5) 

However, a separate `delete_batches_v2` method exists for deleting V2 batches from the "batch_v2" column family: [7](#0-6) 

This method is never invoked in `update_certified_timestamp`, causing V2 batches to accumulate permanently in the database without cleanup.

**Additional Bug:** The same issue exists in `gc_previous_epoch_batches_from_db_v2`, which reads V2 batches but incorrectly attempts to delete them using the V1 deletion method: [8](#0-7) 

**Execution Flow:**
1. Block is committed → `notify_commit` invoked
2. `update_certified_timestamp` called with block timestamp
3. `clear_expired_payload` removes expired batches from in-memory cache (both V1 and V2)
4. `delete_batches` called, but only deletes from "batch" column family
5. V2 batches remain permanently in "batch_v2" column family
6. Process repeats on every block commit, accumulating storage without bound

**Invariant Violations:**
- **Resource Management**: Database storage quota should be bounded and properly reclaimed
- **State Consistency**: Expired batches should be completely removed from all storage layers
- **Cache Coherence**: In-memory cache and persistent storage should maintain consistency

## Impact Explanation
This vulnerability qualifies as **High Severity** under the "Validator Node Slowdowns" category per Aptos bug bounty guidelines.

**Resource Exhaustion**: Once `enable_batch_v2` is enabled, expired V2 batches accumulate continuously in the database:
- Multiple blocks per second means rapid accumulation of undeletable batches
- Database grows without bound over time
- Increased disk I/O overhead during database operations
- Longer node restart times as initialization attempts to load accumulated batches

**Performance Degradation**: The `populate_cache_and_gc_expired_batches_v2` method loads all V2 batches from the database during node restart: [9](#0-8) 

Accumulated expired V2 batches within the expiration buffer window will be reloaded into memory, potentially causing:
- Memory exhaustion from loading thousands of expired batches
- Quota management inconsistencies
- Degraded consensus participation performance
- Potential cascade failures affecting validator operations

While this doesn't directly cause consensus violations, significant validator slowdowns can indirectly affect network health and consensus participation.

## Likelihood Explanation
**Likelihood: High (Conditional on Feature Enablement)**

When `enable_batch_v2` is enabled:
- Triggers automatically on every block commit (several times per second)
- No attacker action required - normal consensus operation causes accumulation
- 100% reproduction rate when V2 batches are in use
- Accumulation rate is proportional to block production frequency

**Current Mitigation**: The `enable_batch_v2` flag is disabled by default: [10](#0-9) 

This significantly reduces immediate impact, as no validators are currently affected unless they explicitly enabled this feature. However, this remains a valid logic vulnerability because:
1. The feature exists in production code as a supported configuration option
2. Enabling it is legitimate validator operator behavior (not malicious)
3. Once enabled, the bug manifests automatically and deterministically
4. Future activation of this feature would expose all participating validators

## Recommendation
The fix requires ensuring V2 batches are deleted alongside V1 batches during cleanup operations:

**Fix for `update_certified_timestamp`:**
```rust
pub fn update_certified_timestamp(&self, certified_time: u64) {
    trace!("QS: batch reader updating time {:?}", certified_time);
    self.last_certified_time
        .fetch_max(certified_time, Ordering::SeqCst);

    let expired_keys = self.clear_expired_payload(certified_time);
    
    // Delete from both V1 and V2 schemas
    if let Err(e) = self.db.delete_batches(expired_keys.clone()) {
        debug!("Error deleting V1 batches: {:?}", e)
    }
    if let Err(e) = self.db.delete_batches_v2(expired_keys) {
        debug!("Error deleting V2 batches: {:?}", e)
    }
}
```

**Fix for `gc_previous_epoch_batches_from_db_v2`:**
```rust
fn gc_previous_epoch_batches_from_db_v2(db: Arc<dyn QuorumStoreStorage>, current_epoch: u64) {
    let db_content = db
        .get_all_batches_v2()
        .expect("failed to read data from db");
    // ... collection logic ...
    
    // Use V2 deletion method for V2 batches
    db.delete_batches_v2(expired_keys)
        .expect("Deletion of expired keys should not fail");
}
```

## Proof of Concept
The vulnerability can be demonstrated by:

1. Enabling `enable_batch_v2` in node configuration
2. Running the validator for multiple epochs
3. Observing the "batch_v2" column family grows without bound
4. Querying the database shows expired V2 batches that should have been deleted
5. Restarting the node shows increased memory usage as expired V2 batches are reloaded

The code evidence clearly shows the logic bug exists in the current implementation where V2 cleanup is incomplete.

## Notes
This is a valid logic vulnerability in production code where the implementation fails to properly clean up V2 batches when the V2 feature is enabled. While the feature is currently disabled by default, it represents a supported configuration option that validators may legitimately enable. The bug manifests automatically during normal operation once enabled, requiring no attacker action. This should be fixed before wider deployment of the V2 batch feature to prevent validator performance degradation.
