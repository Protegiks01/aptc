  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Error Constants Usage] [Timing Attacks] When error constants are used in API responses, do error handling paths have consistent timing regardless of error type, or could timing differences reveal internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [String Encoding] Are all string constants properly encoded as UTF-8, and could encoding issues cause security problems when these strings are logged or transmitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [Character Safety] Do any of these strings contain control characters or special sequences that could cause terminal escape injection when displayed in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_BUILD_PACKAGE] [Build Process] Does the 'failed to build package' error properly clean up partial build artifacts, or could failed builds leave exploitable intermediate state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_CREATE_AND_SUBMIT_TRANSACTION] [Transaction Safety] Can the combined 'failed to create and submit transaction' error mask partial state where transaction was created but not submitted, leading to replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: TRANSFER_COINS] [Test Operation] When the TRANSFER_COINS step uses these constants, does the test harness properly validate that coin transfers cannot exceed balance or cause double-spending? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: PUBLISH_MODULE] [Module Publishing] Does the PUBLISH_MODULE step with associated error constants validate that only authorized accounts can publish modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: CREATE_TOKEN] [Token Creation] When CREATE_TOKEN step fails, do the error messages properly indicate whether failure was due to authorization, resource limits, or other security-relevant reasons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: FAIL_WRONG_BALANCE_AT_VERSION] [Version Consistency] Does the 'wrong balance at version' check properly validate that historical balance queries are consistent with the blockchain state at that version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: CHECK_ACCOUNT_BALANCE_AT_VERSION] [Time-Travel Queries] When checking balance at specific version, could race conditions or caching issues return stale data that masks balance manipulation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_METADATA] [Metadata Existence] Can the 'can't find metadata' error be exploited to determine which NFTs or tokens exist before they are publicly announced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: CHECK_COLLECTION_METADATA] [Metadata Integrity] Does the collection metadata check validate cryptographic signatures to prevent metadata tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constants: OFFER_TOKEN, CLAIM_TOKEN] [Token Transfer] Do these step names indicate proper validation of token ownership transfer, preventing unauthorized token claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constants: CHECK_SENDER_BALANCE, CHECK_RECEIVER_BALANCE] [Transfer Verification] Are sender and receiver balance checks performed atomically to prevent race conditions in token transfer validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: CHECK_VIEW_ACCOUNT_BALANCE] [View Function Safety] Does the view function balance check properly handle malicious view functions that could return incorrect data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_COULD_NOT_VIEW] [View Function Error] Can the generic 'view function failed' error mask critical issues like view functions accessing unauthorized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Error Constants] [Error Composition] When these error constants are concatenated with dynamic data in consuming code, is proper escaping applied to prevent injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [All Constants] [Constant Reuse] Are these string constants reused across different security contexts in a way that could confuse error handling or mask different failure conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: ERROR_NO_BYTECODE] [Bytecode Validation] Does the 'can't find bytecode' error properly distinguish between non-existent modules vs modules with corrupted bytecode? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: CHECK_MODULE_DATA] [Module Verification] Does the module data check validate bytecode signatures and prevent execution of unauthorized or tampered modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: BUILD_MODULE] [Build Security] When BUILD_MODULE step uses these constants, does it prevent inclusion of malicious dependencies or unsafe Move code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/strings.rs] [Constant: SET_MESSAGE] [Message Setting] Does the SET_MESSAGE step properly validate message content to prevent injection of malicious data into on-chain state? (Medium)",
