  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [JWT Validation] In RedisRatelimitChecker's JWT validation path, can attackers provide expired or invalid JWTs that bypass validation through error handling paths that don't properly reject? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Captcha Reuse] Can attackers request a captcha challenge, distribute it to many clients to solve, then submit solutions from multiple IPs to drain tokens beyond rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Header Case Sensitivity] Are header name comparisons in checkers case-insensitive as per HTTP spec, or can attackers bypass checks by using different casing (Authorization vs authorization vs AUTHORIZATION)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Unicode Attacks] Can attackers use Unicode normalization or homoglyph attacks in header values to bypass string matching in auth tokens, referer blocklists, or magic headers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Replay Attacks] Does the system prevent replay of complete() calls with old CompleteData, which could allow attackers to repeatedly decrement rate limits for 500 errors that never occurred? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Time Zone Issues] Can attackers exploit time zone conversions or leap seconds in day calculations to bypass rate limits during transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Database Connection Pool] For checkers using database connections (Redis), can exhausting the connection pool cause new requests to be accepted without rate limiting due to connection failures being handled as 'allow'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Nonce Reuse] If captcha keys or auth tokens can be reused, can attackers build up a collection of valid credentials over time and use them all simultaneously to bypass rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Clock Skew] Can attackers exploit clock skew between multiple faucet servers to bypass time-based rate limits by targeting servers with earlier clocks? (Medium)"
