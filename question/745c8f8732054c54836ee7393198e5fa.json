  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Sort Performance] Can an attacker provide ABIs with pathologically bad sort characteristics (e.g., reverse-sorted input) causing O(n²) sorting behavior and validator slowdowns during SDK generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Exhaustive Matching] Does the match statement on EntryABI variants handle all possible enum variants exhaustively, or could new variants be added that cause the sort to silently fail or use wrong comparison keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Default Case Abuse] The _ wildcard pattern returns empty string for module_name - can this be exploited to cause unexpected sorting behavior or to bypass security checks in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Variant Confusion] Can the BCS deserializer be tricked into creating EntryABI variants with invalid internal state (e.g., EntryFunction with null module_name), causing panics in the sort comparison logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Unwrap Panic] The unwrap() call on path.to_str() can panic if the path contains invalid UTF-8 - can an attacker create directories with invalid UTF-8 names to crash validator nodes during ABI discovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [OsStr Conversion] When converting OsStr to &str fails (returns None), does unwrap() cause a panic that can be triggered by filesystem paths with non-UTF-8 characters, crashing validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Error Context Loss] Does the anyhow error handling preserve sufficient context when errors occur deep in the call stack, or can error messages be too vague to diagnose attacks or bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Partial Success] If some .abi files load successfully but others fail, does the function return a partial result or fail completely - can partial success lead to inconsistent state across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Memory Allocation] Does the Vec::append operation in the recursive call properly handle allocation failures, or can memory exhaustion cause the function to abort ungracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Stack Overflow] Does the recursive implementation have any stack depth limits, or can deeply nested directories cause stack overflow and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Vec Reallocation] As ABIs are pushed into the Vec, can the repeated reallocations cause performance issues or memory fragmentation affecting validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Buffer Lifetime] Is the buffer Vec properly moved into bcs::from_bytes(), or could there be lifetime issues causing use-after-free if the deserialization retains references to the buffer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Concurrent Access] If multiple threads call read_abis() concurrently on the same directory, can race conditions in file system access cause non-deterministic results or corrupted ABI data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Directory Iterator Safety] Is fs::read_dir() iterator safe for concurrent use, or can modifications to the directory during iteration cause undefined behavior or missing files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Extension Validation] Does checking for .abi extension properly validate the full extension, or can attackers use files named 'malicious.abi.backup' to bypass security filters in downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Case Sensitivity] Is the extension comparison case-sensitive on all platforms, or can 'file.ABI' or 'file.Abi' bypass the filter on case-insensitive filesystems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Directory Path Validation] Does the function validate that dir_paths actually point to directories and not files, symlinks, or special devices before processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Empty Directory Handling] If dir_paths contains empty paths or '.', does the function handle this gracefully or can it cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SourceInstaller] [Implementation Safety] Can malicious implementations of SourceInstaller::install_transaction_builders() violate safety invariants by writing to arbitrary filesystem locations when processing ABIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SourceInstaller] [Error Type Abuse] Can implementations define Error types that don't properly propagate error information, causing silent failures in SDK generation that lead to invalid or malicious transaction builders? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SourceInstaller] [Name Injection] Does the 'name' parameter in install_transaction_builders() get properly sanitized, or can attackers inject filesystem path separators to write files outside intended directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SourceInstaller] [ABI Array Safety] Is the &[EntryABI] slice parameter bounds-checked in implementations, or can buffer overruns occur when processing the ABI array? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Module: golang] [Code Generation] Can the golang module generate unsafe Go code from malicious ABIs that bypasses Go's type safety or memory safety when executed by SDK users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Module: rust] [Code Generation] Can the rust module generate Rust code with unsafe blocks or improper bounds checking when ABIs contain adversarial type definitions? (High)",
