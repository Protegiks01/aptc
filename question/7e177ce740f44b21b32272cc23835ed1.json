  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error information leakage] Does the error returned by try_from_bytes() leak sensitive information about internal data structures that could aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [No validation] The new() constructor performs no validation on inputs - can this be exploited to create TokenMutation instances with invalid data that bypass later validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [String allocation] If called with extremely large String parameters, does new() check for memory allocation failures or could it panic/crash when memory is exhausted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Functions: getters] [Reference safety] Do the getter methods returning &String and &AccountAddress create any aliasing issues that could lead to memory safety violations in unsafe code blocks elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Functions: getters] [Information disclosure] Could exposing references to internal fields allow attackers to infer sensitive information about token states or exploit timing side channels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Hash collision] Since TokenMutation doesn't implement Hash but implements Eq, could this cause issues when used in HashMaps/HashSets leading to incorrect deduplication logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Eq] [Equality semantics] Does string equality comparison use constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks when comparing sensitive token values in old_value/new_value? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Module Integration] [Event emission authorization] Is there proper access control in Move code to ensure only authorized modules can emit TokenMutation events, or could malicious contracts emit fake mutation events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Module Integration] [Event replay] Can an attacker capture legitimate TokenMutation events and replay them in a different context to forge state changes or manipulate indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Module Integration] [Indexer trust] Do off-chain indexers blindly trust TokenMutation events without verifying the actual on-chain state, allowing attackers to poison indexer databases with fake data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Module Integration] [Cross-chain replay] If Aptos supports multiple chains/networks, can TokenMutation events from one chain be replayed on another chain to cause state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE] [Initialization race] Is the Lazy initialization of TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE thread-safe, or could concurrent access during initialization cause race conditions or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE] [Memory leak] Does the Lazy static ever get cleaned up, or could repeated re-initialization in tests or special scenarios cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE] [Type argument mismatch] The StructTag has empty type_args - could Move modules with generic Mutation types be confused with this concrete type causing type safety violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Static: TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE] [Module upgrade attack] If the token module is upgraded on-chain, does TOKEN_MUTATION_TYPE remain valid or could stale type tags cause events to be rejected or misprocessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Event size explosion] Without size limits, can an attacker emit massive TokenMutation events (multi-MB strings) that exceed block size limits or transaction gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Storage cost manipulation] Can attackers exploit unbounded event sizes to force validators to store excessive event data, causing storage exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Debug output safety] Could the Debug trait implementation leak sensitive token values (old_value, new_value) into logs or error messages that are accessible to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Format string injection] If Debug output is used in logging without proper sanitization, could attackers inject format specifiers or escape sequences through the String fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Non-deterministic serialization] Is BCS serialization guaranteed to be deterministic across all validator nodes, or could serialization differences cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Locale-dependent string handling] Could locale-specific string comparisons or case conversions in old_value/new_value cause non-deterministic behavior across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Empty string handling] Are empty strings for mutated_field_name, old_value, or new_value handled correctly, or could they cause unexpected behavior in event processing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_mutation.rs] [Struct: TokenMutation] [Field name collision] If mutated_field_name contains special characters or path separators, could it cause directory traversal or field injection attacks in indexers? (Medium)",
