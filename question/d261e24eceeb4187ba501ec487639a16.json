  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Error Message Leakage] At lines 66-68 and 73-77, do the detailed error messages reveal sensitive information about waypoint internals that could help an attacker craft bypass attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_epoch_boundary()] [Error Propagation] At line 51, does returning Ok(Self::new_any(ledger_info)) after the ensure! check properly propagate all possible errors from new_any, or can some errors be silently swallowed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Parse Error Handling] At lines 116 and 121, do the format_err! calls provide sufficient context to diagnose malicious waypoint strings without revealing system internals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Panic Conditions] Are there any conditions under which verify() could panic instead of returning an error, potentially causing validator node crashes during sync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Zero Value Waypoint] Can a waypoint with version=0 and value=HashValue::zero() be exploited to bypass verification checks or match against any LedgerInfo? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Test: test_waypoint_parsing] [Round-Trip Validation] At lines 197-205, does the test adequately cover malicious inputs, or only valid waypoint strings, potentially missing parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Test: test_waypoint_li_verification] [Empty LedgerInfo] At lines 208-225, does testing with empty_li and EpochState::empty() adequately validate that real-world epoch transitions with complex validator sets are handled securely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Missing Tests] Are there tests validating waypoint behavior under concurrent access, Byzantine validator scenarios, or hash collision attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [Clone Performance] At line 146, does cloning potentially large EpochState objects during waypoint creation cause memory exhaustion or performance degradation during DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Temporary Allocation] Does creating Ledger2WaypointConverter at line 70 allocate significant memory that could be exploited for resource exhaustion through repeated verification attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: from_str()] [String Allocation] Can extremely long waypoint strings cause excessive memory allocation during parsing, leading to DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Verifier Trait] [Interface Misuse] Can implementers of the Verifier trait other than Waypoint incorrectly implement the verification logic, causing inconsistent trust assumptions across the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify() trait] [LedgerInfoWithSignatures Validation] At line 85, does calling ledger_info.ledger_info() strip away signature validation that should have been checked before waypoint verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Ledger2WaypointConverter] [BlockInfo Dependency] Does the conversion rely on BlockInfo fields that might not be properly validated elsewhere, allowing malicious BlockInfo to propagate through waypoint creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Derive: BCSCryptoHash] [BCS Format Security] At line 130, does the BCS serialization format have any known vulnerabilities or ambiguities that could cause different nodes to compute different hashes for the same logical data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Untrusted Input] Can deserializing waypoints from untrusted sources (network, config files, APIs) cause arbitrary code execution, panics, or state corruption? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [FromStr] [Untrusted Config] Can waypoints parsed from untrusted configuration sources during node startup compromise the initial trust anchor and redirect nodes to malicious chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: verify()] [Version Pinning Attack] Can an attacker with < 1/3 Byzantine validators create a valid waypoint at a specific version and then stall the chain at that version to prevent honest nodes from syncing further? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Function: new_epoch_boundary()] [Fake Epoch Boundary] Can Byzantine validators coordinate to create a LedgerInfo that passes ends_epoch() check but doesn't represent a real validator set transition, fragmenting the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/waypoint.rs] [Struct: Waypoint] [Waypoint Downgrade] Can an attacker force nodes to accept a waypoint from an earlier version/epoch, causing them to revert to outdated validator sets and potentially control the reverted chain? (Critical)",
