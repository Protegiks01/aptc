  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_LATENCY] [Information disclosure] Can attackers analyze API_TEST_LATENCY metrics to infer API endpoint performance characteristics, transaction processing patterns, or network topology information useful for planning targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_step_latency()] [Information disclosure] Does test_step_latency() expose detailed test execution flow through step_name labels that could reveal internal testing methodologies or security test procedures to unauthorized observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_success()] [Metric poisoning] Can malicious tests call test_success() with false positive results to inflate success metrics and hide actual API failures, misleading operators about system health and masking underlying issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_fail()] [Metric poisoning] Does test_fail() have any authentication or authorization checks, or can unauthorized callers inject fake failure metrics that trigger false alerts and create noise in monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_error()] [Metric poisoning] Can attackers repeatedly call test_error() with fabricated error scenarios to create alert fatigue, causing operators to ignore legitimate critical errors in the API testing infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_latency()] [Metric poisoning] Can malicious code call test_latency() with artificially low latency values to mask actual performance degradation, preventing operators from detecting and responding to real API slowdowns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_step_latency()] [Metric poisoning] Does test_step_latency() validate that recorded latencies are within reasonable bounds (e.g., 0-3600 seconds), or can negative/infinite values corrupt histogram buckets and invalidate statistical calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_SUCCESS] [Histogram misconfiguration] Does API_TEST_SUCCESS use appropriate histogram buckets for counting success events, or is using a histogram instead of a counter causing unnecessary memory overhead and confusing metric semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_FAIL] [Histogram misconfiguration] Is API_TEST_FAIL correctly configured with histogram buckets suitable for failure counts, or would a Counter metric type be more appropriate and memory-efficient for tracking discrete failure events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_ERROR] [Histogram misconfiguration] Does the API_TEST_ERROR histogram have default bucket boundaries that make sense for error counting, or are the histogram buckets misconfigured causing inefficient memory usage and meaningless distribution data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_LATENCY] [Histogram configuration] Are the default histogram buckets for API_TEST_LATENCY appropriate for API latency measurements (sub-second to several seconds), or could bucket misconfiguration cause all observations to fall in a single bucket, losing distribution information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_STEP_LATENCY] [Histogram configuration] Does API_TEST_STEP_LATENCY use custom histogram buckets optimized for step-level latencies, or are default buckets causing poor resolution in critical latency ranges for performance analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_success()] [Concurrency] When multiple threads concurrently call test_success() with the same label values, can race conditions in the underlying Prometheus histogram implementation cause lost observations or incorrect count aggregation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_fail()] [Concurrency] Does test_fail() safely handle concurrent access from multiple test threads, or can simultaneous label lookups cause contention in the HistogramVec internal HashMap leading to performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_latency()] [Concurrency] If thousands of test threads simultaneously call test_latency() with different label combinations, can lock contention in with_label_values() cause significant performance bottlenecks affecting test execution times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_SUCCESS] [Memory leak] Once created, do histogram instances with specific label combinations ever get cleaned up, or do they persist indefinitely causing memory to grow unbounded as new test_name/network_name/run_id combinations are used over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Static: API_TEST_STEP_LATENCY] [Memory leak] With five label dimensions, can long-running API tester processes accumulate thousands of histogram instances that are never garbage collected, eventually exhausting memory in continuous testing environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_step_latency()] [Resource leak] Does the Prometheus client library provide any mechanism to remove or reset histogram instances for completed tests, or do all created label combinations remain in memory until process termination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_success()] [Error handling] If with_label_values() fails due to label cardinality limits or memory pressure, does test_success() return an error or silently drop observations, potentially losing critical test success data without operator awareness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_error()] [Error handling] Can failures in metric recording within test_error() itself create recursive error scenarios or cause panics that crash the testing framework when trying to report errors about the metrics system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_latency()] [API misuse] Can callers pass arbitrary string values for the result parameter that don't match expected values (e.g., 'success', 'fail', 'error'), creating inconsistent label values and making metrics difficult to query or aggregate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/counters.rs] [Function: test_step_latency()] [API misuse] Does test_step_latency() enforce any constraints on step_name values to ensure consistency across tests, or can arbitrary strings create fragmented metrics that can't be meaningfully aggregated in monitoring dashboards?
