  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Constants: Lines 13-43] [Label mismatch] Can typos in label constant strings cause metrics to be recorded under wrong labels, fragmenting data and hiding attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: STORAGE_SYNCHRONIZER_PENDING_DATA] [Label confusion] Can confusion between storage synchronizer operation labels cause metrics to be mixed, making it impossible to track which pipeline stage is failing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Constants] [Label injection] If label constants are modified at runtime through unsafe code or memory corruption, can attackers redirect metrics to hide attack signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: CONSENSUS_EXECUTING_GAUGE] [Cross-component] Can race between consensus and state-sync components updating CONSENSUS_EXECUTING_GAUGE cause it to show incorrect state, confusing orchestration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: EXECUTING_COMPONENT] [Cross-component] If multiple components incorrectly increment EXECUTING_COMPONENT counter simultaneously, can metric corruption hide which component is actually executing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: DRIVER_FALLBACK_MODE] [Cross-component] Can fallback mode gauge be manipulated by one component while another is making decisions based on it, causing incorrect mode transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: BOOTSTRAPPER_ERRORS] [Monitoring gap] Does BOOTSTRAPPER_ERRORS counter track all error types comprehensively, or can certain attack-related failures bypass metric recording? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: CONTINUOUS_SYNCER_ERRORS] [Monitoring gap] Are continuous syncer error labels granular enough to distinguish between benign failures and active attacks, or do they all increment the same counter? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: STORAGE_SYNCHRONIZER_ERRORS] [Monitoring gap] Can storage synchronizer errors related to data corruption be distinguished from transient I/O errors in metrics, or are they mixed together? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Function: read_gauge()] [Decision vulnerability] If state sync driver uses read_gauge to make critical decisions about when to commit, can metric manipulation cause premature commits or stalls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: STORAGE_SYNCHRONIZER_PIPELINE_CHANNEL_BACKPRESSURE] [Decision vulnerability] Can attackers manipulate backpressure metrics to trick pipeline into throttling or aggressive processing, causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/metrics.rs] [Static: DRIVER_FALLBACK_MODE] [Decision vulnerability] If fallback mode decisions are based on DRIVER_FALLBACK_MODE gauge, can metric manipulation force validator into degraded fallback mode unnecessarily? (Medium)"
