  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Usage: proposal_status_tracker.rs] [Timing attack] Can Byzantine validators manipulate proposal timing to control when PayloadUnavailable timeouts are added to the queue, biasing exclude_authors calculations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Usage: proposal_status_tracker.rs] [State desync] Can different validators evict proposal statuses at different times due to race conditions, causing divergent window sizes and conflicting optimistic/pessimistic decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Edge case: capacity=1] [Eviction loop] With capacity=1, does every push operation evict the previous item, and can this cause excessive churn in consensus tracking structures? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Edge case: capacity=usize::MAX-1] [Allocation failure] Can setting capacity near usize::MAX cause VecDeque::with_capacity() to fail or trigger OOM killer on validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Edge case: empty queue] [Underflow] When queue is empty and pop operations are attempted, can this cause panics or return invalid None values that break consensus logic? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-collections/src/bounded_vec_deque.rs] [Concurrency: Ordering] Without synchronization, can reordering of push/pop operations cause different validators to see different eviction sequences? (High)",
