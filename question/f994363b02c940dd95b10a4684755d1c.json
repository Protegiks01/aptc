Can consensus block indefinitely trying to send QuorumStoreRequests if mempool is slow, causing consensus to halt and total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Mutable config] The node_config parameter is &mut NodeConfig. Can mempool modify critical configuration values that affect other services, causing security policy violations or configuration drift? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Database reader cloning] db_rw.reader is cloned at line 192. Can the cloned reader become stale if the original db_rw is updated, causing mempool to validate transactions against outdated state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Network interface race] network_interfaces contains both client and service_events. Can a race condition cause mempool to receive messages before it's fully initialized, leading to panics or message loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Mempool listener safety] mempool_listener is passed without validation. Can a malicious or compromised listener leak transaction data before blocks are committed, enabling front-running attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Client receiver handling] mempool_client_receiver is consumed by mempool. If the sender side (from bootstrap_api_and_indexer) is dropped prematurely, does mempool handle the channel closure gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Consensus receiver ownership] consensus_to_mempool_receiver is moved into mempool. Can mempool fail to process messages from this receiver, causing consensus-submitted batches to be silently dropped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Reconfig subscription safety] mempool_reconfig_subscription is consumed. If reconfiguration events are missed or delayed during initialization, can mempool operate with stale validator sets causing transaction routing failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Peers metadata sharing] peers_and_metadata is Arc-cloned and passed to mempool. Can concurrent modifications by network components cause mempool to route transactions to invalid or Byzantine peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_mempool_runtime_and_get_consensus_sender()] [Return value timing] The function returns both Runtime and Sender simultaneously. Can the caller use the Sender before the Runtime is fully started, causing messages to be lost in an uninitialized mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_admin_service()] [Thread spawn safety] AdminService::new spawns a new thread (implied). Can an attacker trigger multiple calls to this function, spawning excessive threads and causing resource exhaustion or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_admin_service()] [Configuration exposure] The admin service receives full node_config access. Can the admin API leak sensitive configuration data like private key paths, consensus parameters, or network topology? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_admin_service()] [Concurrent admin access] If multiple AdminService instances are created (programming error), can concurrent admin operations cause configuration conflicts or race conditions affecting node security? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_node_inspection_service()] [Data client exposure] aptos_data_client is passed directly to the inspection service.

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/services.rs] [Function: start_node_inspection_service()] [No return value] The function returns () with no handle to the started service. Can the inspection service continue running even after node shutdown, leaking information post-shutdown? (Low)",
