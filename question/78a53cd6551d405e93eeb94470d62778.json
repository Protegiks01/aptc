  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization Leak] When the configuration is serialized (e.g., for logging or debugging), can it accidentally expose sensitive flags or configurations that should remain private? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Optional ChainId] When chain_id is None, the sanitizer skips all checks - can this create a window where nodes boot without chain ID validation, allowing configuration exposure during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [is_mainnet() Bypass] Does ChainId.is_mainnet() properly validate against all mainnet chain IDs (including potential future mainnet forks), or can an attacker use an unrecognized mainnet variant to bypass the check? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [is_validator() Bypass] Can the NodeType.is_validator() check be bypassed by running hybrid nodes that participate in consensus but identify as fullnodes, avoiding sanitization while exposing validator data? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Chain ID Race] If chain_id is updated during runtime (e.g., during chain migration or regenesis), can the optimizer be triggered with stale chain_id values, enabling endpoints on mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error Propagation] Does the sanitizer error properly halt node startup, or can the error be caught and ignored, allowing mainnet validators to run with exposed configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Result Handling] If optimize() returns Err, does the caller handle it properly, or can errors be silently ignored, leaving configurations in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Panic Safety] Can any input values (malformed ChainId, invalid NodeType) cause panics in sanitize(), crashing validators during startup and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Modified Flag Accuracy] If optimize() fails to detect actual modifications (returns false when it modified config), can this cause config drift where local YAML and runtime config diverge? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_config_mainnet] [Incomplete Coverage] The test only validates Validator node type - are other node types (ValidatorFullnode, PublicFullnode) properly tested for mainnet configuration exposure scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Test: test_optimize_testnet_partial_config] [Edge Case] Does the test cover scenarios where local_config_yaml has malformed or partially invalid structures that could bypass null checks in optimize()? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Test Coverage] [Concurrency Testing] Are there tests validating thread-safety of sanitize() and optimize() when called concurrently during config reloads, or can race conditions corrupt configuration state? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_configuration] [Config Leak] What specific configuration data is exposed when expose_configuration=true? Can it include consensus keys, validator private keys, network secrets, or database credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_identity_information] [Identity Leak] What identity information is exposed - can it include node private keys, peer-to-peer authentication secrets, or validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_peer_information] [Topology Leak] Does peer information expose the complete validator set, their IP addresses, connection patterns, and network topology that enables targeted network attacks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field: expose_system_information] [Fingerprinting] Can system information enable OS fingerprinting, version detection, and vulnerability mapping for targeted exploits against validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Trait: ConfigSanitizer] [Sanitizer Order] Is InspectionServiceConfig::sanitize() called in the correct order relative to other sanitizers, or can earlier sanitizers modify values that bypass inspection service checks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Trait: ConfigOptimizer] [Optimizer Conflicts] Can multiple ConfigOptimizers conflict, where one optimizer enables endpoints while another tries to restrict them, creating non-deterministic security states? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Import: NodeConfig] [Circular Dependency] Can NodeConfig modifications during sanitize/optimize create circular updates that lead to infinite loops or stack overflows during config validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [YAML Bomb] Can an attacker inject a YAML bomb (deeply nested structures, billion laughs attack) into local_config_yaml that exhausts memory during optimize() parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Type Coercion] Does serde_yaml perform unexpected type coercion on boolean fields (e.g., 'yes'/'no', 'on'/'off') that could bypass is_null() checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Unicode Exploitation] Can Unicode or special characters in YAML keys ('inspection_service' vs 'inspection_service\\u200B') create look-alike attacks that bypass configuration checks? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Partial Update] If optimize() partially updates some expose_* flags before encountering an error, is the configuration rolled back, or does it remain in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Field Mutations] [Atomicity] Are all field modifications (expose_configuration, expose_identity_information, etc.) performed atomically, or can concurrent reads observe partially-updated states? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/inspection_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Validation Timing] Is sanitize() called before optimize(), ensuring that optimizations cannot enable insecure configurations that were previously restricted? (High)"
