  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Crypto: Hash Consistency] For ConsensusSessionKey Hash trait, do PerIssuerMode (Issuer) and PerKeyMode ((Issuer, KID)) use the same hash function, or can algorithm differences cause session key collisions across modes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Concurrency: Parallel Consensus] Can multiple concurrent calls to new_rb_request for the same issuer but different payloads create race conditions where both requests succeed but only one should be processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Concurrency: Mode Switch] During epoch transition when consensus mode changes, can ongoing consensus from the old mode interfere with new consensus from the new mode causing mixed-mode state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Concurrency: Session Key Access] Is ConsensusSessionKey access in concurrent HashMap operations thread-safe, or can simultaneous insertions for the same key cause data races in the channel sender? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Memory: Issuer Size] Can unbounded issuer byte vectors (Vec<u8>) cause memory exhaustion if Byzantine validators broadcast extremely large issuer names in ObservedUpdateRequest? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Memory: KID Size] In PerKeyMode, can unbounded KID byte vectors cause memory amplification when many concurrent key-level consensus sessions are active? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Memory: Clone Performance] Does cloning Issuer/KID in session_key_from_qc for every QC create performance bottlenecks when handling high-frequency JWK updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Error: anyhow::Result] Does using anyhow::Result throughout the trait make it impossible for implementations to return typed errors that calling code can programmatically handle? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Error: Silent Failures] Can errors from new_rb_request or session_key_from_qc be silently ignored by callers using '?' operator, causing consensus to appear successful while actually failing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Error: Panic Paths] Do any implementations contain unwrap() or expect() calls that could panic on malformed input, causing validator crashes instead of graceful error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Type: Lifetime Elision] Does the 'static bound on TConsensusMode prevent implementations from borrowing data, forcing unnecessary clones that could be optimized? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Type: Trait Object Safety] Is TConsensusMode trait object safe, or do associated types prevent it from being used as dyn TConsensusMode causing design limitations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Type: Send + Sync Bounds] Are Send + Sync bounds necessary on both the trait and associated types, or do they create redundant constraints that could be relaxed? (Low)"
