  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Public Visibility] [API Surface] Does making AptosPackageHooks pub(crate) provide sufficient encapsulation, or should it be completely private to prevent misuse by other crates in the workspace? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Organization] [Circular Dependencies] Can circular dependencies between exported modules (harness, stake, aptos_governance) create initialization order issues that break test environment setup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [UPGRADE_POLICY_CUSTOM_FIELD] [Constant Security] Is UPGRADE_POLICY_CUSTOM_FIELD properly validated to prevent injection of malicious policy strings that bypass upgrade compatibility checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: custom_package_info_fields()] [Return Value Trust] Do callers of custom_package_info_fields() properly validate the returned vector, or is the UPGRADE_POLICY_CUSTOM_FIELD blindly trusted without verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: harness] [FakeExecutor Security] Does the exported harness module's FakeExecutor bypass critical security checks (signature validation, gas metering, consensus) that must be enforced in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Testing Infrastructure] [Production Contamination] Can test-only code paths enabled by this module accidentally execute in production due to feature flag misconfigurations or build system errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Symbol Import] [Type Confusion] Can importing Symbol from move_symbol_pool without validation allow injection of malicious symbols that bypass package name verification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Export: stake] [Economic Exploits] Do exported stake testing utilities allow creation of invalid staking states (negative stakes, overflow rewards) that could be replicated in production if test code leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [CustomDepInfo] [Dependency Injection] Can malicious CustomDepInfo structures passed to resolve_custom_dependency() exploit parsing vulnerabilities before the bail!() error is raised? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Method Ordering] Does the order of method execution in PackageHooks (custom_package_info_fields, custom_dependency_key, resolve_custom_dependency) affect security, or can calling them in unexpected orders bypass validations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module: aptos_governance] [Proposal Manipulation] Can exported governance testing utilities create proposals with manipulated voting thresholds, execution delays, or stake requirements that affect mainnet if test configurations are copied? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Function: resolve_custom_dependency()] [Error Message] Does the generic 'not used' error message in resolve_custom_dependency() provide sufficient information for security auditing, or does it hide actual dependency resolution attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/lib.rs] [Global State] [Test Pollution] Can state modifications made by one test using these exported modules pollute the execution environment of subsequent tests, causing non-deterministic security validation failures? (Medium)"
