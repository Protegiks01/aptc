  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState::InProgress] [my_proposal tampering] Is my_proposal immutable once set in ConsensusState::InProgress, or can attackers modify it during consensus to cause validators to reach different conclusions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState::Finished] [Double finalization] Can ConsensusState transition to Finished multiple times with different QuorumCertifiedUpdate values, causing validators to finalize conflicting JWK updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Impl: PartialEq for ConsensusState] [Equality bypass] The PartialEq implementation ignores abort_handle_wrapper and vtxn_guard - can attackers exploit this to make semantically different states compare as equal, bypassing safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState::NotStarted] [Uninitialized state exploit] Can attackers send messages that assume ConsensusState is InProgress when it's actually NotStarted, causing panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Function: ConsensusState::my_proposal_cloned()] [Panic in production] The my_proposal_cloned() function panics if called on NotStarted - can attackers trigger this panic in production code paths to cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState] [Missing synchronization] Is ConsensusState properly synchronized with Arc<Mutex<>> or similar when accessed from multiple async tasks, or can data races corrupt consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: ConsensusState::Finished] [QuorumCertifiedUpdate mismatch] Can the QuorumCertifiedUpdate in Finished state differ from my_proposal, allowing validators to finalize updates they didn't originally propose? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: JWKConsensusMsg] [Message type substitution] Can an attacker deserialize an ObservationRequest as ObservationResponse or vice versa to bypass request-response validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Function: JWKConsensusMsg::name()] [Typo in name() function] Line 29 returns 'KeyLevelObservationResponse' for KeyLevelObservationRequest variant - can this naming inconsistency cause message routing bugs or logging confusion that masks attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateRequest vs ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [Request confusion] Can attackers send ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest when ObservedUpdateRequest is expected to cause type confusion and process per-key updates as provider-level updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Impl: RBMessage for JWKConsensusMsg] [Reliable broadcast exploit] Does the RBMessage implementation ensure exactly-once delivery semantics, or can Byzantine nodes exploit reliable broadcast to replay messages and build duplicate quorum certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateResponse] [Response without request] Can validators send ObservedUpdateResponse without corresponding ObservedUpdateRequest, flooding the network with unsolicited data to exhaust resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: JWKConsensusMsg] [Missing message authentication] Are JWKConsensusMsg messages authenticated at the transport layer, or can man-in-the-middle attackers inject or modify messages between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [KID manipulation] Can attackers manipulate the KID (Key ID) field in ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest to reference wrong keys or bypass access controls on specific key identifiers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Enum: JWKConsensusMsg] [Protocol downgrade] Can attackers force nodes to downgrade from KeyLevelObservationRequest to provider-level ObservationRequest, reducing security granularity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateRequest] [Issuer validation bypass] Is the Issuer field in ObservedUpdateRequest validated against a whitelist, or can attackers query arbitrary issuers to probe for information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Function: JWKConsensusMsg::epoch()] [Epoch extraction race] Can concurrent calls to epoch() on the same message return different values if the message is being modified, causing race conditions in epoch validation? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Non-deterministic serialization] Is ProviderJWKs serialization deterministic across all validators, or can serialization differences cause signature verification to fail on valid updates? (High)",
