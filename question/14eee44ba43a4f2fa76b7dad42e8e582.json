  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_view/db_state_view.rs] [Function: get()] [Proof verification bypass] Can an attacker exploit the conditional proof verification logic where verification only occurs when both version and maybe_verify_against_state_root_hash are Some, allowing unverified state reads when maybe_verify_against_state_root_hash is None despite having a valid version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_view/db_state_view.rs] [Function: get()] [TOCTOU race condition] In the proof verification path, can a race condition occur between get_state_value_with_proof_by_version and get_state_value_with_version_by_version where the underlying state changes, causing proof to verify against different data than what's returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_view/db_state_view.rs] [Function: get()] [Error handling bypass] Does the silent Ok() wrapping around get_state_value_with_proof_by_version allow attackers to bypass proof verification by triggering errors that are caught and ignored, returning unverified state values?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_view/db_state_view.rs] [Function: get()] [Proof verification logic] Does the proof.verify() call properly validate that the proof corresponds to the exact version requested, or can an attacker provide a valid proof for a different version causing state confusion?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_view/db_state_view.rs] [Function: get()] [TODO exploitation] The TODO comment mentions buffered state lacks proof support - can an attacker force reads to use buffered state to bypass all proof verification and serve malicious state values?
