  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [SSRF] Can an attacker control the URL parameter in HealthChecker::Http to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery attacks against internal services (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin), potentially accessing metadata endpoints or internal APIs that should not be reachable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [SSRF] Does the HTTP health check validate URL schemes, or can an attacker use file:// or gopher:// protocols to read local files or exploit other protocol handlers through the reqwest library? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [DNS Rebinding] Can an attacker exploit DNS rebinding attacks by providing a URL that initially resolves to a legitimate host but later resolves to an internal IP address, bypassing network security controls during health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the HTTP GET request have a timeout configured, or can a malicious server cause indefinite hangs by never responding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for the localnet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there a maximum response size limit for HTTP requests, or can an attacker return an arbitrarily large response body that exhausts memory and crashes the health checker process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [HTTP Response Handling] Does the health check validate HTTP status codes, or does it accept any successful connection (including 404, 500, etc.) as a healthy response, potentially reporting false positives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [TLS Validation] If HTTPS URLs are provided, does reqwest properly validate TLS certificates, or can an attacker perform MITM attacks with self-signed certificates during health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [Redirect Following] Does reqwest follow HTTP redirects automatically, and if so, can an attacker redirect the health check to malicious URLs, bypassing initial URL validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [Information Disclosure] Do error messages from failed HTTP requests leak sensitive information about internal network topology, service versions, or authentication requirements through the with_context() error formatting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - Http variant] [URL Parsing] Can an attacker exploit URL parsing inconsistencies between Url::clone() and reqwest::get() to bypass validation or access unintended endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [API Authentication] Does the Node API health check bypass authentication mechanisms, or can it be exploited to probe for authenticated endpoints without proper credentials? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on the get_index() call, or can an attacker trigger excessive health checks to overwhelm the Node API with requests, causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [SSRF] Similar to Http variant, can an attacker control the NodeApi URL to perform SSRF attacks through the aptos_rest_client, accessing internal blockchain endpoints or metadata services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [Response Validation] Does get_index() validate the response structure and content, or can a malicious server return crafted responses that cause panics or undefined behavior in the REST client? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [Connection Pooling] Does aptos_rest_client::Client properly manage connection pools, or can repeated health checks create connection leaks that exhaust available file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [Timeout Handling] Does get_index() have proper timeout configuration, or can a slow/hanging Node API cause indefinite blocks in the health check, preventing the localnet from starting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - NodeApi variant] [Error Propagation] Do errors from get_index() leak internal state information or authentication tokens through error chains that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [GRPC Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the GRPC URL to connect to malicious GRPC servers that exploit vulnerabilities in the create_data_service_grpc_client function or tonic library? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Timeout Bypass] The GRPC client has a 5-second timeout at line 61, but does this timeout apply to all operations including stream initialization, or can an attacker cause indefinite hangs in the get_transactions() stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Stream Exhaustion] Does the health check properly close the GRPC stream after reading the first message, or can unclosed streams accumulate and exhaust server resources over repeated health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Deserialization Attacks] Can a malicious GRPC server send crafted protobuf messages that exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in the GetTransactionsRequest or response handling at lines 64-77? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Request Validation] Does GetTransactionsRequest with starting_version=0 have proper validation, or can this trigger unexpected behavior in the indexer data service, such as returning excessive amounts of data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Error Context Leakage] Do the error contexts at lines 72 and 76-77 leak sensitive information about the GRPC stream internals, server topology, or transaction data structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [TLS Configuration] Does create_data_service_grpc_client enforce TLS/mTLS for GRPC connections, or can an attacker perform MITM attacks by intercepting unencrypted GRPC traffic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/health_checker.rs] [Function: check() - DataServiceGrpc variant] [Resource Amplification] Can an attacker exploit the GRPC stream to trigger resource amplification attacks where a small health check request causes the server to perform expensive operations or return large datasets?
