  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Consensus: Determinism] [Serialization determinism] When identifiers are serialized for consensus messages, is the serialization format completely deterministic and platform-independent? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Economic: DoS] [Validation cost] Can attackers submit transactions with many invalid identifiers forcing validators to burn CPU cycles on validation without paying proportional gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/identifier.rs] [Economic: DoS] [Collision attacks] Can attackers generate many identifiers with the same hash prefix to degrade HashMap performance in module resolution, slowing down validators? (Low)",
