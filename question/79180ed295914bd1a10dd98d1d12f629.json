  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: sig_verify_struct()] [Test coverage gap] Does the benchmark only test valid signatures, missing edge cases where malformed signatures might bypass validation in the underlying Ed25519Signature::verify() implementation, potentially allowing signature forgery in production code? (Critical - if underlying implementation is vulnerable)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: sig_verify_zero_bytes()] [Test coverage gap] Does verify_arbitrary_msg() with empty bytes properly handle all edge cases in signature verification, or could malicious actors exploit untested boundary conditions in zero-length message validation? (High - if underlying implementation has gaps)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: pk_deserialize()] [Test coverage gap] Does the benchmark test Ed25519PublicKey::try_from() with malicious/malformed byte sequences that could cause panics or incorrect deserialization in production, potentially allowing invalid public keys to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: sig_deserialize()] [Test coverage gap] Does Ed25519Signature::try_from() handle all malformed signature byte sequences securely, or could attackers craft signatures that deserialize incorrectly but are accepted by production code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: small_subgroup_check()] [Test coverage gap] Does is_small_order() correctly identify all small subgroup points that could be exploited for cryptographic attacks, or are there untested edge cases in curve point validation? (Critical - small subgroup attacks)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: random_message()] [Weak test data] Does using only alphanumeric characters in test messages adequately exercise signature verification with special bytes (0x00, 0xFF, control characters) that might reveal edge cases in production signature validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Struct: TestAptosCrypto] [Test data limitations] Does the benchmark adequately test CryptoHasher and BCSCryptoHash implementations with malicious inputs that could cause hash collisions or incorrect serialization in production consensus/transaction validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: sig_verify_struct()] [Missing attack vectors] Does the benchmark test replay attack scenarios where the same signature is verified multiple times, potentially missing performance degradation attacks in production? (Low - DoS out of scope)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: pk_deserialize()] [Missing validation tests] Are public keys with invalid curve points tested during deserialization, or could production code accept public keys not on the Ed25519 curve? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ed25519.rs] [Function: small_subgroup_check()] [Cryptographic vulnerability] Could attackers exploit the lack of comprehensive small subgroup testing to generate public keys in small subgroups, breaking signature security in production? (Critical)"
