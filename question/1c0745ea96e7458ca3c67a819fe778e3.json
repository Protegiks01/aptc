  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: PanicError] [Error Suppression] Can a malicious transaction craft inputs that trigger CodeInvariantError repeatedly during parallel execution, causing BlockSTM to incorrectly classify genuine bugs as speculative errors and suppress critical invariant violations that should halt the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: PanicError] [Consensus Safety] If a Byzantine validator modifies the error handling logic to convert CodeInvariantError into benign errors during transaction execution, can they hide consensus-breaking bugs and cause state divergence across honest validators leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Information Disclosure] Does the error logging at line 30 leak sensitive internal state information (memory addresses, cryptographic material, validator identities) that could be exploited by attackers monitoring validator logs to predict future block proposals or validator behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [DoS via Error Flooding] Can an attacker craft malicious transactions that trigger thousands of code_invariant_error() calls per block, flooding validator logs and causing disk I/O saturation that degrades consensus performance and threatens liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Race Condition] Is the error! macro call at line 30 thread-safe when multiple parallel execution threads invoke code_invariant_error() simultaneously? Could race conditions in the logging subsystem cause log corruption or lost error messages that hide critical invariant violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Error Conversion Abuse] Can a malicious smart contract exploit the expect_ok() function by passing crafted Result types that appear as Ok but contain poisoned values, bypassing error checks and causing undefined behavior in downstream VM execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Type Confusion] Does expect_ok() properly validate the generic types V and E at line 34? Could an attacker exploit Rust's type system to pass non-Debug types that panic during format!() call, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Format String Injection] At line 35, if the Debug formatting of error E contains unvalidated user input, can an attacker inject format specifiers or control characters that corrupt error messages or cause log injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Impl: From<PanicError> for PartialVMError] [Status Code Confusion] Can a Byzantine validator modify the status code mapping at line 50 from DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR to a different code, causing the block executor to misclassify fatal errors as recoverable and commit corrupted state to chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Impl: From<PanicError> for VMError] [Location Spoofing] At line 59, the conversion uses Location::Undefined. Can an attacker exploit this to hide the true source of invariant violations, making it impossible to debug consensus bugs or identify compromised modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Impl: From<PanicOr<T>> for StatusCode] [Error Classification Bypass] At lines 80-89, can an attacker craft a PanicOr<T> variant that matches neither CodeInvariantError nor Or, exploiting undefined behavior in the match statement to bypass error handling entirely?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Enum: PanicOr<T>] [Type Safety Violation] Can an attacker exploit the generic type parameter T at line 19 to pass non-Debug types that violate trait bounds, causing panics in error handling code and crashing validator nodes during transaction execution?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: map_non_panic()] [Closure Exploitation] At lines 64-69, can a malicious closure function f contain infinite loops or resource-intensive operations that are executed during error handling, causing DoS when errors occur in critical consensus paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: map_non_panic()] [Error Transformation Attack] Could an attacker chain multiple map_non_panic() calls with carefully crafted transformations to convert a CodeInvariantError into a benign error type, hiding critical bugs from detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Trait: NonPanic] [Marker Trait Bypass] At line 104, the NonPanic trait is used as a marker.

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Impl: From<T> for PanicOr<T>] [Generic Constraint Violation] At lines 106-110, does the implementation properly enforce that T implements both Debug and NonPanic? Could trait coherence rules allow bypassing these constraints for foreign types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/error.rs] [Function: canonical()] [Integer Overflow] At line 157, the bit shift (category << 16) + reason can overflow if category or reason values are maliciously large.
