  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [native_ripemd160] [Bitcoin compatibility] Does RIPEMD-160 match Bitcoin's implementation exactly for cross-chain operations, or could subtle differences break compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Empty input handling] Can zero-length byte vectors cause division-by-zero, underflow, or other edge case bugs in any hash function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Maximum input size] What happens when bytes.len() == usize::MAX - can it cause wraparound, overflow, or allocation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Gas exhaustion mid-hash] If a transaction runs out of gas during hash computation, is the partial state properly rolled back? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Charging failures] When context.charge() fails, do functions immediately return the error or can they continue executing, wasting resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Allocation failures] Can to_vec() operations fail on memory exhaustion, and if so, are these failures handled gracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Overall architecture] [Function selection attack] Can attackers deliberately choose weak hash functions (RIPEMD-160, SipHash) for security-critical operations to exploit known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Overall architecture] [Migration path] If any hash function needs to be deprecated due to cryptographic breaks, can existing Move contracts be migrated without breaking state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Overall architecture] [Testing coverage] Are there comprehensive test vectors from NIST, IETF, or other standards bodies to ensure all 6 hash functions are correctly implemented? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Overall architecture] [Fuzzing] Have all hash functions been fuzzed with random inputs to find crash bugs, hangs, or non-determinism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Overall architecture] [Quantum resistance] Are any of these hash functions quantum-vulnerable (SipHash 64-bit output vulnerable to Grover's), requiring future upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Byzantine validator] Can a malicious validator modify their local hash.rs to return manipulated hash outputs that favor their transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Selective censorship] Can validators detect specific transaction patterns by their hash function calls and selectively censor them? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [All functions] [Performance variance] Can validators on different hardware (x86 vs ARM) experience significant performance differences causing liveness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Compilation] [Optimization flags] Can aggressive compiler optimizations (LTO, PGO) introduce non-determinism in hash outputs across different validator builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Compilation] [Unsafe code in deps] Do any dependencies use unsafe Rust that could cause undefined behavior if compiler assumptions change? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/hash.rs] [Compilation] [Target-specific code] Can conditional compilation (#[cfg(target_arch = 'x86_64')]) in dependencies cause different behavior on different CPU architectures? (High)"
