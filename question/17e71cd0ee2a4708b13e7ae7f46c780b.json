  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Struct: PipelineInputRx] [Receiver drop] If receivers in PipelineInputRx at lines 120-126 are dropped before senders send, do the pipeline stages properly handle send errors or do they assume successful delivery? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/pipelined_block.rs] [Struct: PipelinedBlock] [Clone safety] Does the PartialEq at lines 213-219 properly compare all fields, or can blocks with different pipeline state be considered equal, causing incorrect block deduplication? (High)",
