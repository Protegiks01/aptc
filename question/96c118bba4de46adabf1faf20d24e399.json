  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Consensus] [Consensus Config Manipulation] Can an attacker craft malicious OnChainConsensusConfig values that break consensus safety or liveness when deployed via governance proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade() - Consensus] [Async Reconfig Race] The validation waits for MAX_ASYNC_RECONFIG_TIME (60s) - can an attacker exploit the asynchronous reconfiguration window to revert consensus changes before validation completes?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade() - Execution] [Error Message Confusion] The error message says 'Consensus config mismatch' for Execution config validation failure - can this confusion lead to incorrect debugging or security issue misidentification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ReleaseEntry] [Config Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the enum structure to wrap one config type as another (e.g., Consensus as Execution) to bypass type-specific validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Version] [Version Downgrade Attack] Does the version upgrade generation prevent version downgrades, or can an attacker propose reverting to an older AptosVersion with known vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade() - Version] [Version Validation Timeout] With only 60 seconds timeout, can network delays or validator disagreements cause legitimate version upgrades to fail validation incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ProposalMetadata] [Metadata URL Validation] The default URLs point to aptos-core GitHub - can an attacker inject malicious URLs in source_code_url or discussion_url that phish users or redirect to malware sites? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: Default for ReleaseConfig] [Unsafe Default Config] The default config includes DeprecatedSenderAwareV1 transaction shuffler - can this deprecated default be exploited to introduce insecure configurations?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade() - Randomness] [Config Conversion Attack] The validation converts ReleaseFriendlyRandomnessConfig to OnChainRandomnessConfig to RandomnessConfigMoveStruct - can information be lost or manipulated during these conversions?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_signer_arg()] [Signer Reference Manipulation] The function returns different signer arguments based on execution mode - can this be exploited to pass invalid signer references that bypass authorization checks?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_proposal_scripts()] [Multi-Step Ordering] For MultiStep proposals, scripts are generated in reverse then reversed - can an attacker exploit this double-reversal to create inconsistent proposal ordering?
