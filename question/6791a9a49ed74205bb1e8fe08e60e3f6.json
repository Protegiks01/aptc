  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block tampering] When receiving ExecutionRequest, is there cryptographic verification that ordered_blocks haven't been tampered with since ordering phase? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Size limits] Is there a maximum size limit on ordered_blocks vector to prevent memory exhaustion attacks, or can arbitrarily large vectors be passed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block window validation] Are the OrderedBlockWindow dependencies of each block validated to ensure they exist in the vector, or can missing dependencies cause panics? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionSchedulePhase] [Stateless violation] Since ExecutionSchedulePhase is stateless, can multiple concurrent calls to process() interfere with each other through shared global state or singleton resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Trait: StatelessPipeline] [Interface contract] Does the StatelessPipeline implementation properly handle all edge cases expected by the trait contract, or can unexpected inputs cause contract violations? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Non-deterministic execution] Can any operations in the async block at lines 70-76 be non-deterministic (e.g., timing-dependent, HashMap iteration), causing validators to compute different results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Execution order] Is the order of wait_for_compute_result() calls guaranteed to match block order, or can concurrent execution cause results to be set in non-deterministic order? (High)",
