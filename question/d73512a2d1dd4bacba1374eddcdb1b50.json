  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Function: extract_txns_from_block(), Line 138] [Empty Payload] When payload is None, the function returns Ok(vec![]) - can this hide evidence of blocks that should contain transactions but were corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Function: extract_txns_from_block()] [Payload Version Handling] The function handles 5 different Payload variants - if new payload types are added in future versions, will the function fail safely or cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Function: extract_txns_from_block()] [Transaction Deduplication] If the same transaction appears in both inline_batches and quorum store batches, will it be extracted twice, masking consensus bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Function: extract_txns_from_block()] [Lifetime Safety] The function returns Vec<&'a SignedTransaction> with lifetime tied to all_batches - can this cause dangling references if all_batches is deallocated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Function: extract_txns_from_block()] [Type Safety] Does the function properly handle all transaction types within SignedTransaction, or can malformed transactions cause deserialization errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Architecture] [Database Coupling] The tool directly opens QuorumStoreDB and ConsensusDB without going through proper access layers - can this bypass important validation or security checks in the normal database access path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Architecture] [No Authentication] There are no authentication or authorization checks before accessing consensus databases - can any local user or process read all historical consensus data including validator votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Architecture] [No Encryption] The tool reads databases in plaintext - if databases contain sensitive validator keys or private transaction data, can this lead to key material exposure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Architecture] [Audit Logging] Are there any audit logs when this tool is used to dump consensus data, or can attackers extract data without leaving traces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Architecture] [Resource Limits] The tool has no memory limits, timeouts, or resource constraints - can it be used to exhaust system resources by dumping terabytes of transaction data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Line 4] [Clippy Override] The #![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)] directive disables important safety warnings - does this hide legitimate panics that could be triggered by malicious database content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Error Handling] [Inconsistent Patterns] Some functions use .unwrap() while others use ? operator - can this lead to inconsistent error handling where some errors panic and others propagate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Error Handling] [Information Leakage] Error messages using bail! macro may leak sensitive information about database structure, batch digests, or transaction content to stdout/logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Memory Safety] [Large Allocations] Multiple functions load entire datasets into memory (all_batches, blocks, txns) - can this cause OOM kills on nodes with limited memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone Operations] The code uses .cloned() on transactions - can this cause performance issues or memory exhaustion when cloning millions of large transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Concurrency] [Thread Safety] If multiple threads call this tool simultaneously, can race conditions in RocksDB access cause corruption or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Concurrency] [Database Locks] Does RocksDB handle concurrent reads safely, or can this tool interfere with active consensus operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Validation] [Block Integrity] The tool extracts transactions without validating block signatures or quorum certificates - can this dump data from invalid blocks that shouldn't be trusted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Validation] [Transaction Signatures] Extracted transactions are not signature-validated - can this include unsigned or improperly signed transactions that were never executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Validation] [Batch Integrity] Batches retrieved from QuorumStoreDB are not validated - can corrupted or malicious batches be included in the output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Validation] [Digest Verification] Hash digests are used as keys but never re-computed or verified - can digest mismatches hide data corruption or attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Schema Migration] If database schemas change between versions, can old data cause deserialization failures or security issues when using this tool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Corruption Detection] The tool doesn't check for database corruption - can it propagate corrupted data as valid transaction information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [Checkpoint Interference] If the database is being checkpointed or backed up, can concurrent access via this tool cause corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Database] [RocksDB Options] Both databases are opened with default options - are there missing security options like encryption_at_rest, checksums, or paranoid_checks? (High)"
