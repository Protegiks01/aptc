  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Attack: History Manipulation] Can validators with database write access (corrupted nodes) manipulate NewBlockEvents to alter past reputation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Attack: Window Sliding] By carefully timing block production, can Byzantine validators ensure their failures slide out of the window before penalization? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Attack: Vote Withholding] Can validators strategically withhold votes to reduce others' reputation while maintaining their own? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Attack: False Failure Attribution] Can the next leader falsely report the previous leader as failed in failed_proposer_indices? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Rust: Integer Casting] Multiple 'as' casts (u32 as u64, u64 as u128, etc.) - can any cause truncation or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Rust: Lifetimes] The history_iter function returns impl Iterator with complex lifetimes - can lifetime issues cause use-after-free? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Rust: Send + Sync] The MetadataBackend and ReputationHeuristic traits require Send + Sync - are all implementations actually thread-safe? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Rust: Arc Cloning] Multiple Arc clones of backend and heuristic - can reference counting issues cause memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Error: Silent Failures] When bitvec_to_voters() or indices_to_validators() fail, errors are logged but votes/failures dropped - can this be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Error: Database Errors] If aptos_db operations fail, the function returns empty results or HashValue::zero() - can this cause systematic wrong leader election? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Error: Assertion Failures] Multiple assert!() calls can panic - should these be checked at initialization rather than runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Error: BCS Deserialization] If bcs::from_bytes fails for NewBlockEvent, the error is propagated - can malformed events cause consensus halt? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/liveness/leader_reputation.rs] [Liveness: Stuck Leader] If the elected leader is always the same Byzantine node with failed_weight but highest stake, can this halt consensus? (Critical)",
