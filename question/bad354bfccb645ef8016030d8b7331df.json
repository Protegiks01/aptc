  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Name confusion] At lines 78-86, can adversaries exploit the function name 'get_state_storage_usage_only_at_epoch_beginning' to create confusion with similarly named functions, causing wrong function calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Registration override] Can malicious code re-register the native function with make_all() to replace native_get_usage with a malicious implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Type safety] Does make_named_natives at line 86 properly validate that native_get_usage signature matches the expected Move function signature, or can type mismatches cause VM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Struct: NativeStateStorageContext] [Reference safety] Can the &'a dyn reference at line 23 outlive the actual resolver object, causing use-after-free when native_get_usage is called after resolver is dropped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Unwrap safety] Does the map_err at line 63 handle all possible error cases from get_usage(), or can unexpected errors cause unwrap panics that halt transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Memory leaks] Can repeated calls to native_get_usage leak memory through SmallVec allocations or Value construction, causing validators to run out of memory over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Struct: NativeStateStorageContext] [Drop safety] Is there a proper Drop implementation to clean up the resolver reference, or can context drops cause dangling pointers in storage systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Epoch transition race] Can calling native_get_usage exactly during an epoch boundary cause it to read inconsistent storage state (partially old epoch, partially new epoch), corrupting StateStorageUsage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Timing dependency] The function name 'only_at_epoch_beginning' suggests timing constraints - can calling this at wrong times cause determinism issues or expose implementation-defined behavior?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Reconfiguration safety] During on-chain reconfigurations, can state changes between epoch N and N+1 cause get_usage() to return values that don't correspond to any consistent state snapshot? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Friend module bypass] While state_storage.move restricts access to friends, can adversaries exploit native function calling conventions to bypass Move-level access controls and call native_get_usage directly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Module verification] Does the Move verifier properly ensure that only authorized modules can call the native function, or can malicious bytecode bypass verification to call it? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Zero values] Can resolver.get_usage() return zero values for items and bytes in legitimate scenarios, and would this corrupt storage gas calculations when used as denominators? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Performance attack] Can adversaries craft transactions that repeatedly call native_get_usage in loops, causing O(n) storage lookups that slow down block execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/state_storage.rs] [Function: native_get_usage()] [Cache poisoning] If resolver implementations use caching, can adversaries poison caches to cause get_usage() to return incorrect values on subsequent calls? (Medium)",
