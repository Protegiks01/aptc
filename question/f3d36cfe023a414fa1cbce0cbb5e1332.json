  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Runtime Creation] Line 103 creates a new runtime with aptos_runtimes::spawn_named_runtime(). Can this fail due to resource constraints? What happens if runtime creation fails and the function tries to use runtime.handle()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Runtime Ownership] The function returns the Runtime at line 124. If the caller drops this Runtime prematurely, will all spawned tasks (coordinator, gc_coordinator, snapshot_job) be aborted causing mempool shutdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [CoreMempool Creation] Line 104 creates CoreMempool::new(config) wrapped in Arc<Mutex>. Can this constructor fail or panic with invalid config? Is there proper error handling to prevent uninitialized mempool state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [VM Validator Creation] Lines 105-108 create PooledVMValidator::new() with num_cpus::get() as pool size. Can num_cpus::get() return 0 or invalid value causing panic or creating validator pool with no workers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [VM Validator Pool Size] The VM validator pool size is set to num_cpus::get(). On systems with very high CPU count (>256 cores), can this cause excessive resource consumption or contention in validator pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [VM Validator Initialization] PooledVMValidator is initialized with Arc::clone(&db). If database is not fully synced or in inconsistent state during bootstrap, can validator make incorrect decisions on transaction validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Empty Subscribers] Line 121 passes empty vec![] as subscribers to start_shared_mempool(). Does this break any notification logic that assumes at least one subscriber exists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Parameter Ordering] The function calls start_shared_mempool() with many parameters (lines 109-123). Can incorrect parameter ordering due to refactoring cause type confusion if parameters have same type? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Configuration Validation] Does bootstrap() validate the config parameter before creating CoreMempool and passing to start_shared_mempool()? Can malformed config cause panic during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Database State] The db Arc<dyn DbReader> is cloned multiple times (line 106 for validator, line 119 for start_shared_mempool). Can these clones observe different database states due to concurrent writes causing inconsistent validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Network Events] The network_service_events parameter is passed directly to start_shared_mempool without validation. Can malformed or closed event stream cause coordinator to panic immediately after start? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Client Events] The client_events MempoolEventsReceiver channel is passed directly. If this channel is already closed or has pending messages, does it affect mempool initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Quorum Store Channel] The quorum_store_requests Receiver is passed to coordinator. If consensus has already sent requests before bootstrap completes, are those requests lost or buffered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Mempool Listener] The mempool_listener is passed directly. If state sync has already committed blocks before mempool starts, does mempool miss those commit notifications causing stale transactions to remain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Reconfig Listener] The mempool_reconfig_events listener is passed directly. If an epoch change occurs during bootstrap, can coordinator miss the reconfig event causing it to use stale on-chain config? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Peers Metadata] The peers_and_metadata is passed directly. If peer connections are established before mempool bootstraps, does mempool miss peer connection events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Runtime Name] Line 103 names the runtime 'shared-mem'. Can having multiple instances of bootstrap() create runtime name conflicts? Does this affect runtime identification or metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Type Parameters] The function uses DbBackedOnChainConfig as concrete type for ConfigProvider. Can this cause issues if different on-chain config source is needed during emergency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Return Timing] The function returns Runtime immediately after calling start_shared_mempool() without waiting for tasks to start. Can caller use runtime before mempool is fully initialized causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Resource Cleanup] If bootstrap() is called multiple times (e.g., during restart), are previous Runtime instances properly shutdown to avoid resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: start_shared_mempool()] [Arc Clone Pattern] The mempool Arc is cloned at line 38, 80, and 86. Can this cloning pattern cause lock ordering issues if gc_coordinator and snapshot_job acquire locks in different order than coordinator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [Arc Clone Pattern] The db Arc is cloned at line 106 and 119. Can concurrent read operations from validator and coordinator observe inconsistent database snapshots during state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: start_shared_mempool()] [Mutex Contention] With coordinator, gc_coordinator, and snapshot_job all accessing mempool via Mutex, can lock contention during high transaction load cause coordinator to miss network events or broadcasts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: bootstrap()] [RwLock Pattern] The vm_validator uses RwLock. Can write lock acquisition during validator updates block coordinator's read attempts causing transaction validation delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/runtime.rs] [Function: start_shared_mempool()] [Task Spawn Order] Tasks are spawned in order: coordinator, gc_coordinator, snapshot_job. Can this ordering cause gc_coordinator to start garbage collecting before coordinator initializes peer state? (Medium)"
