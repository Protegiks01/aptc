  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Sensitive data exposure] Does the Debug trait implementation for DKGTranscriptRequest expose dealer_epoch in log messages, and if logs are publicly accessible, can this leak information about DKG protocol state to potential attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Transcript leakage] When DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse is logged using Debug trait, does it expose the full transcript_bytes content, potentially leaking cryptographic secrets if DKG transcripts contain sensitive key material? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Missing validation] Does any code path validate DKGTranscriptRequest fields before processing, or are dealer_epoch values trusted without bounds checking, potentially allowing wraparound or underflow in arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Envelope validation] Before dispatching to variant-specific handlers, is there validation that DKGMessage enum variant matches expected protocol state, or can out-of-sequence messages bypass state machine checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: name()] [String injection] Although name() returns static strings, if these strings are used in constructing log messages or database queries without proper escaping, can they introduce injection vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Transcript binding] Is the DKGTranscript in TranscriptResponse cryptographically bound to the dealer_epoch in the original TranscriptRequest, or can transcripts be malleably moved between epochs by Byzantine validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Request authentication] Does each DKGTranscriptRequest include a cryptographic signature from the requester, or can unsigned requests be accepted, allowing impersonation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Response integrity] Is there a MAC or signature covering the entire TranscriptResponse including metadata and transcript_bytes, or can attackers tamper with responses in-flight without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch authenticity] Does the epoch value extracted by epoch() method come from a cryptographically authenticated source, or can man-in-the-middle attackers modify epoch values to cause validators to process messages in wrong epoch contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Epoch arithmetic overflow] If downstream code performs dealer_epoch + 1 or dealer_epoch + offset calculations without overflow checks, can a DKGTranscriptRequest with dealer_epoch = u64::MAX - 1 cause integer overflow and wraparound to 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch comparison safety] When comparing epochs from different message types, is there protection against integer comparison vulnerabilities where u64::MAX compares as less than 0 due to type coercion bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Epoch subtraction underflow] If validation logic checks (current_epoch - request.dealer_epoch > threshold), can a request with dealer_epoch > current_epoch cause subtraction underflow that wraps to large positive value, bypassing threshold checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Message size limits] Is there enforcement of maximum message size for DKGMessage instances before network transmission, or can attackers send multi-gigabyte TranscriptResponse messages to overwhelm network buffers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Network partition exploitation] Can Byzantine validators send DKGTranscriptRequest only to specific validators to create network partitions where different validator subsets have different transcript views? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Message ordering assumptions] Does the DKG protocol assume FIFO or causal ordering of DKGMessage delivery, and if so, can Byzantine validators exploit network reordering to violate protocol invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Enum exhaustiveness] If new variants are added to DKGMessage in future without updating all match statements, can this cause panics or incorrect behavior in message handlers that assumed only two variants existed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Field visibility] Is dealer_epoch field intentionally public, and if so, can external code mutate it after construction, bypassing the new() constructor's intended initialization logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Derive macro safety] Does the CryptoHasher derive macro handle all field types correctly, or can adding new fields with special types in future cause the hash function to behave unpredictably? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Zero epoch handling] Is dealer_epoch = 0 valid and handled correctly as genesis epoch, or does it cause special case bugs in epoch comparison and validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Metadata null handling] If DKGTranscript.metadata is somehow null or uninitialized during deserialization corruption, will accessing response.metadata.epoch cause a segfault or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Empty transcript handling] Can TranscriptResponse contain a DKGTranscript with empty transcript_bytes (length 0), and if so, does aggregation logic handle empty transcripts without causing division by zero or invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: name()] [Name uniqueness] Are the string values returned by name() guaranteed to be unique across all enum variants, or could future variants introduce name collisions causing ambiguity in logging or metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Request spam] Without rate limiting, can a single Byzantine validator send millions of DKGTranscriptRequest messages per second to exhaust honest validators' network bandwidth and CPU processing requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Large transcript DoS] Can a malicious validator respond with DKGTranscript containing multi-gigabyte transcript_bytes to cause memory exhaustion when honest validators attempt to aggregate transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch lookup overhead] If epoch() is called repeatedly in hot paths without caching, and transcript metadata access is expensive, can this cause performance degradation that slows down DKG protocol execution? (Low)"
