  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Output] [Multiple Balances] The functions return Vec<AccountBalance> but always with a single element - can future modifications that return multiple balances introduce vulnerabilities in balance aggregation or display? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Output] [Balance Units] The balance is displayed as raw u64 without decimal conversion - can this cause user confusion about actual token amounts if different coins have different decimal places? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Security] [Malicious Node] If a user connects to a compromised or malicious REST API node, can the node exploit the multiple unwrap() calls to crash the CLI, leak information, or present false balance data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Security] [Balance Manipulation] Can a malicious node return arbitrarily large or small balance values to mislead users into making incorrect financial decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Security] [Privacy Leak] Does querying balance via view functions leak the querying user's IP address or identity to node operators, potentially enabling surveillance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/balance.rs] [Security] [Dependency Chain] Are the imported types and functions (ViewFunction, AptosCoinType, parse_type_tag, etc.) from trusted dependencies, or can supply chain attacks compromise these imports? (Low)"
