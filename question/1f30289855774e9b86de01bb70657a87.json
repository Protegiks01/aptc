  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Line: 372] [RefCell Borrow] The env.cmp_types.borrow_mut() at line 372 - if multiple threads are generating Boogie code concurrently, could this RefCell mutation cause runtime panics due to borrow checker violations? (Medium - Concurrency Safety)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_prelude()] [Shared Environment] Does the GlobalEnv parameter allow concurrent access during prelude generation, or could race conditions cause inconsistent type information to be collected across multiple verification tasks? (Low - Concurrent Verification)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 175-176] [Context Mutation] The repeated context.insert() calls throughout the function - is the Context struct thread-safe, or could concurrent template rendering cause data races? (Low - Thread Safety)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 417-420] [Tera Rendering] Does Tera::default() and tera.render() support concurrent use, or could multiple threads rendering templates simultaneously cause non-deterministic output or crashes? (Low - Concurrent Rendering)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Line: 150] [Writer Parameter] The CodeWriter parameter - if multiple threads write to the same CodeWriter concurrently, could this cause interleaved Boogie code that breaks parsing? (Medium - Output Integrity)",

(Low - Edge Case)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/boogie-backend/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 282-295] [No Native Instances] If a module has no native function instantiations, does filter_native return an empty vector without panicking, or could the sorted() and collect_vec() chain fail on empty iterators?
