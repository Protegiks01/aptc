  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new()] [Event handle validation] Does new() validate that coin_register_events and key_rotation_events have unique EventKeys, or can attackers create accounts with colliding event streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new_stateless()] [EventKey collision] In new_stateless(), EventKeys are created with hardcoded creation numbers (0 and 1) - can attackers exploit this predictability to cause EventKey collisions across different accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Struct: AccountResource] [Event handle cross-contamination] If coin_register_events and key_rotation_events share the same underlying EventKey through deserialization errors, can events from one stream contaminate the other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: rotation_capability_offer] [Capability theft] Can an attacker deserialize AccountResource with rotation_capability_offer pointing to their own address, gaining unauthorized ability to rotate victim's authentication keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: rotation_capability_offer()] [TOCTOU attack] Between checking rotation_capability_offer() and using the capability, can the offer be revoked or changed, causing time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: signer_capability_offer] [Unlimited signing power] If signer_capability_offer is set to Some(attacker_address), can the attacker gain permanent signing authority over the victim account without any revocation mechanism? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new()] [Default capability initialization] Does new() initialize rotation_capability_offer and signer_capability_offer to None without validation, or can attackers pass Some(malicious_address) during construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Function: new_stateless()] [Stateless capability abuse] Since new_stateless() sets both capability offers to None, can attackers exploit this to create accounts that permanently cannot offer capabilities, breaking expected account functionality? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Struct: AccountResource] [Capability offer race condition] Can concurrent modifications to rotation_capability_offer and signer_capability_offer cause inconsistent capability state that grants unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: rotation_capability_offer] [Address validation] Is the AccountAddress in rotation_capability_offer validated to exist and not be a reserved system address that could break capability logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Field: signer_capability_offer] [Self-delegation] Can an account set signer_capability_offer to Some(self_address), creating circular capability delegation that causes infinite loops in capability resolution? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Struct: AccountResource] [BCS encoding ambiguity] Does BCS deserialization enforce canonical encoding, or can attackers create multiple different byte sequences that deserialize to the same AccountResource, breaking content addressing?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/core_account.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization size attack] Can an attacker create an AccountResource with extremely large authentication_key Vec<u8> that causes serialization to consume excessive memory and crash validators? (High)",
