  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/traits.rs] [Function: reconstruct_decryption_key()] [Share ordering dependency] Does reconstruct_decryption_key() produce the same output regardless of the order of shares in the input slice, or can reordering affect the result and cause validator disagreement? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/traits.rs] [Function: decrypt()] [Decryption key validation] Does decrypt() validate that the decryption_key was properly reconstructed from a threshold of shares, or can a malformed key cause incorrect decryption or information leakage? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/traits.rs] [Function: decrypt_individual()] [Decryption key round mismatch] Does decrypt_individual() verify that the decryption_key was derived for the correct round matching the ciphertext, or can keys from different rounds be used to attempt decryption?
