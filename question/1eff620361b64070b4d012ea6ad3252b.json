  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: ok()] [SmallVec capacity exploitation] SmallVec uses inline storage for 1 element - can returning many values cause unexpected heap allocations that bypass gas metering for memory operations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: err()] [Negative gas cost] The #[cold] annotation suggests this is an error path - can negative or overflow costs be passed to err() to manipulate the total gas consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: out_of_gas()] [Zero partial cost exploit] Can out_of_gas() be called with zero partial_cost after expensive operations to get free computation up to the out-of-gas point? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: out_of_gas()] [Partial cost overflow] Can the partial_cost parameter overflow when representing very large consumed gas amounts, causing incorrect gas accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Abort code extraction vulnerability] When extracting abort_code from err.all_data() at line 107, can a malicious PartialVMError be crafted to return None for abort_code, causing it to default to UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR and hiding the real error? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Major status check bypass] The function only checks if major_status == ABORTED at line 106 - can other error statuses be crafted to bypass this check and cause incorrect error conversion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Gas charge on error] When converting an error to NativeResult::Abort, the cost is still charged - can this be exploited to drain gas from transactions while causing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Error data tuple destructuring] The all_data() call returns a 6-tuple and only abort_code is used - can other error data fields be manipulated to cause unexpected behavior when only abort_code is extracted?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Non-abort error passthrough] At line 114, non-ABORTED errors are passed through directly - can this allow VM invariant violations to be returned from native functions when they should have been caught earlier? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Empty stack access] When arguments.pop_back() returns None at line 131, can this be triggered in production to cause UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR when it should have been caught by the verifier? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Type conversion attack] Can value_as::<$t>() be called with a mismatched type $t to trigger type confusion and extract raw bytes from the Value enum? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Invariant violation on mismatch] When value_as() returns an error at line 136, is this a true invariant violation or can it be triggered by malicious bytecode that passed verification? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Stack order exploitation] Since arguments are pushed first-to-last but popped last-to-first, can incorrect pop_arg! ordering in native functions cause arguments to be processed in wrong order? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Reference type extraction] Can pop_arg! be used to extract reference types (e.g., &mut) and bypass Move's borrow checker, allowing native code to hold multiple mutable references? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Early return side effects] The macro returns early on errors - can this leave the arguments stack in an inconsistent state if some but not all arguments have been popped? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Architecture] [Native function trust boundary] Native functions have direct access to VM internals via NativeContext - can a compromised or buggy native function violate Move's safety guarantees (resource linearity, reference safety) that the verifier enforces? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Architecture] [Determinism violation] Can different implementations of the same native function return different NativeResult variants (Success vs Abort vs OutOfGas) based on system state, causing validators to produce different state roots?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Architecture] [VecDeque argument order] The documentation states 'Popping values from arguments gives the arguments in reverse order' - can native function implementers misunderstand this and process arguments in wrong order?
