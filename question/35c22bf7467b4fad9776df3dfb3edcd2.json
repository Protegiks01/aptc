(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Struct: PrebuiltPackage] [Clone performance] PrebuiltPackage derives Clone - when large packages with megabytes of bytecode are cloned, can this cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion in hot paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Struct: PrebuiltPackagesBundle] [BTreeMap overhead] Using BTreeMap for packages provides ordering but has overhead - can an attacker exploit the O(log n) access time by triggering worst-case access patterns to cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Generated Code] [Static lifetime] PREBUILT_BUNDLE has 'static lifetime and is never freed - can extremely large bundles cause memory to be permanently locked, reducing available memory for other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Code template injection] The hardcoded Rust code template uses string literals - can special characters in generated paths or names break out of the template and inject malicious Rust code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Copyright header manipulation] The generated code includes a copyright header - can manipulating the generation process cause incorrect or missing license information that creates legal issues?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Function: create_prebuilt_packages_bundle()] [Rustfmt skip directives] The generated code uses #[rustfmt::skip] - does this prevent detection of maliciously formatted code or unusual patterns by automated tools?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Generated Code] [Import dependencies] The generated code imports specific types from aptos_transaction_generator_lib and aptos_sdk - if these dependencies are compromised or have vulnerabilities, can they affect all generated code?
