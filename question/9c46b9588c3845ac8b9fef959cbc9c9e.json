  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Send/Sync Violation] Is OrderVoteProposal correctly marked as Send + Sync for concurrent use? Can Arc<QuorumCert> contain interior mutability that violates Sync requirements, causing undefined behavior in multi-threaded validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Panic in Clone] Can the Clone derive implementation panic if Block or BlockInfo cloning fails (e.g., out of memory), leaving validators in inconsistent state with partially cloned data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Debug Derive Information Leak] Does the Debug derive expose sensitive internal state (validator keys, signatures, block contents) that could be logged inadvertently and exploited by attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: PipelinedBlock::order_vote_proposal()] [Block Store Inconsistency] In pipelined_block.rs line 466, can the block_info() returned differ from the actual block's info if there's a race condition between block execution completion and order_vote_proposal() call? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: broadcast_order_vote()] [Network Message Tampering] Between creating the OrderVoteProposal and broadcasting it as OrderVoteMsg, can network-level tampering modify the proposal fields before it reaches other validators? (Medium - requires breaking network security)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: construct_and_sign_order_vote()] [Safety Rules Bypass] Can an attacker construct a valid OrderVoteProposal that passes all verify_order_vote_proposal() checks but still violates consensus safety when the resulting OrderVote is aggregated into a QC? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: OrderVoteMsg] [Message Wrapping Attack] When OrderVoteProposal is wrapped in OrderVoteMsg with the QC, can inconsistencies between the wrapped QC and the proposal's internal quorum_cert enable equivocation detection bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Epoch Boundary Attack] Can an OrderVoteProposal be created during epoch transition (block_info.next_epoch_state.is_some()) with a quorum_cert from the old epoch, causing validators to mix epoch state and violate safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Round Gap Exploitation] Can an OrderVoteProposal skip multiple rounds (e.g., round 5 to round 10) without proper timeout certificates, bypassing the round progression safety rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Backward Round Attack] Can an OrderVoteProposal with block.round() < safety_data.one_chain_round be created and partially processed before being rejected, wasting validation resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Future Round Speculation] Can an attacker create OrderVoteProposal instances for future rounds (far ahead of current round) to manipulate safety_data tracking or cause premature round advancement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Nil Block Confusion] Can an OrderVoteProposal contain a NIL block with non-zero transactions or state changes in block_info, causing confusion between NIL and normal block processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Optimistic Block Attack] Can an OrderVoteProposal for an optimistic block (block.is_opt_block()) be processed differently than normal blocks, enabling attacks that bypass standard validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Validator Set Mismatch] Can the quorum_cert signatures be from a different validator set than the one active when the OrderVoteProposal is validated, bypassing validator set consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Transaction Version Gap] Can block_info.version be set to a value that skips transaction versions (e.g., from version 100 to 110), allowing hiding of transactions or state changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Accumulator Root Mismatch] Can block_info.executed_state_id differ from the actual transaction accumulator root after executing the block, enabling state commitment forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Signature Status Bypass] Can the quorum_cert contain SignatureWithStatus entries marked as verified without actual verification, bypassing signature validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Function: new()] [Null/Default Value Injection] Can new() be called with default/empty values for block, block_info, or quorum_cert (using Default trait) to create invalid proposals that bypass validation checks expecting non-default values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: safety_data persistence] [Persistent State Manipulation] Can creating and validating OrderVoteProposal instances cause safety_data to be persisted in an inconsistent state (e.g., one_chain_round updated but highest_timeout_round not), enabling future safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: order vote aggregation] [Aggregation Mismatch] When multiple validators sign order votes from the same OrderVoteProposal, can differences in how they validated it (timing, state) cause their signed LedgerInfo values to differ, preventing QC formation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Block Execution Status] Can an OrderVoteProposal be created for a block before it has completed execution (compute_result not finalized), allowing ordering of blocks with indeterminate state?
