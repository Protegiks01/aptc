(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/config.rs] [Function: create_live_data_service() line 137] [Config Clone] The config is cloned on line 137 - if the original config is mutated after service creation, can this cause inconsistencies between configuration and runtime behavior?
