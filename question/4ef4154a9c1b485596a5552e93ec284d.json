  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start() - AugDataSignature] [Signature validation] When AugDataSignature messages are processed (line 462 mentions unreachable), are signatures validated before aggregation, or can invalid signatures corrupt the certificate? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Threshold manipulation] Does the certificate require exactly 2/3+1 signatures or can it accept any quorum size, allowing Byzantine validators to produce under-signed certificates? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Generic type S: TShare] [Type confusion] Can different validators use different implementations of TShare (S) that are incompatible, causing share aggregation to fail or produce different randomness values? (Critical)",
