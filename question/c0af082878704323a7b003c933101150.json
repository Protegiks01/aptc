  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: set_data_dir()] [Path Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious path values through set_data_dir() that cause safety_rules to read/write data to unauthorized locations, potentially leaking private keys or corrupting safety data? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: set_data_dir()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to set_data_dir() create race conditions where safety rules data directory is changed mid-operation, causing corruption of safety state or double-signing vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: enable_broadcast_vote()] [Vote Broadcast Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator exploit enable_broadcast_vote() by toggling vote broadcasting on/off to selectively reveal votes, enabling strategic withholding and consensus manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: enable_broadcast_vote()] [Configuration Inconsistency] Can mismatched broadcast_vote settings across validators (some true, some false) cause consensus divergence where votes don't propagate correctly? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: max_blocks_per_sending_request()] [Quorum Store Override Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the conditional logic in max_blocks_per_sending_request() by manipulating quorum_store_enabled state to request more blocks than allowed (switching between 10 and 10, but override should be 100)? (Medium)",

  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: max_blocks_per_receiving_request()] [Receive Limit Bypass] Can an attacker exploit max_blocks_per_receiving_request() to send max_blocks_per_receiving_request_quorum_store_override (100) blocks when quorum store is enabled, overwhelming receiver memory and causing crashes? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: max_blocks_per_receiving_request()] [Send/Receive Mismatch] Can inconsistencies between max_blocks_per_sending_request (10) and max_blocks_per_receiving_request (100) with quorum store be exploited to cause protocol violations or state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_send_recv_block_limits()] [Validation Bypass] Can an attacker bypass sanitize_send_recv_block_limits() checks by providing configs where send > recv but passing validation due to logic errors in the inequality checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_send_recv_block_limits()] [Error Message Injection] Can malicious config values cause the error message format in sanitize_send_recv_block_limits() to include user-controlled strings, enabling log injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_send_recv_block_limits()] [Integer Overflow in Comparison] Can integer overflow in send/recv comparisons within sanitize_send_recv_block_limits() cause validation to incorrectly pass when send > recv due to wrapping? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_send_recv_block_limits()] [Partial Validation] Does sanitize_send_recv_block_limits() only check txns and bytes but miss other send/recv pairs (like inline_txns), allowing those to be exploited with send > recv? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_batch_block_limits()] [Batch/Block Mismatch] Can an attacker craft configs where quorum_store.receiver_max_batch_txns exceeds various block limits, bypassing the checks in sanitize_batch_block_limits() to cause batch sizes larger than blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_batch_block_limits()] [Backpressure Loop Exploit] Can the for loop over pipeline_backpressure in sanitize_batch_block_limits() miss certain backpressure configurations, allowing batch sizes to exceed backpressure block limits?

  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_batch_block_limits()] [Only Bytes Checked] Does sanitize_batch_block_limits() only validate batch bytes against block bytes for backpressure/backoff but miss transaction count validation, allowing txn count mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_batch_block_limits()] [Type Conversion Vulnerability] Can casting receiver_max_batch_txns and receiver_max_batch_bytes to u64 in sanitize_batch_block_limits() cause overflow or truncation issues that bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Incomplete Validation] Does sanitize() only call SafetyRulesConfig::sanitize() and QuorumStoreConfig::sanitize() but miss validating ConsensusConfig's own fields, leaving exploitable misconfigurations?
