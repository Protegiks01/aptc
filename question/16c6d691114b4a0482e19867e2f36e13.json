  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Function: Version::deserialize()] [Whitespace Attack] Can attackers inject whitespace around version components (e.g., ' 1 . 2 . 3 ') that passes the split check but fails parsing at lines 215-217, causing inconsistent error states?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/manifest.rs] [Struct: Version] [Comparison Safety] Are Version structs used in safety-critical comparisons, and could integer overflow in major/minor/patch fields at lines 84-86 cause incorrect version ordering leading to use of incompatible dependencies? (High)",
