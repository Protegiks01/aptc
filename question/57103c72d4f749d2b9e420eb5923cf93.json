  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Panic in Parallel] If the parallel iteration at lines 75-82 encounters an error in lru_cache.put(), can this panic the rayon thread pool and crash the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: add_version()] [Version Overflow] Can the Version type overflow if validators process an extremely large number of transactions, and would this cause the version ordering assertion to behave incorrectly when versions wrap around? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Length Overflow] Can locked.len() at line 64 overflow or return unexpected values if the VecDeque grows extremely large, bypassing the eviction check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Constant: NUM_VERSIONS_TO_CACHE] [Configuration Attack] Can an attacker exploit the hardcoded NUM_VERSIONS_TO_CACHE=2 by causing rapid version turnover that keeps exactly 2-3 versions cached, maximizing eviction overhead and degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: add_version()] [Write Lock Contention] Can concurrent calls to add_version() from multiple validator threads cause write lock contention that degrades transaction processing throughput and affects consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Lock Ordering] Can maybe_evict_version() create lock ordering issues by acquiring read lock (line 63), releasing it, then acquiring write lock (line 85), while another thread does the opposite, potentially causing deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: get_version()] [Read Lock Starvation] Can heavy write traffic from add_version() starve get_version() read operations, preventing validators from accessing cached nodes and causing them to repeatedly query disk storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Long-Held Lock] Can the write lock held during pop_front() at line 85 block all other cache operations for extended periods if VecDeque operations are slow, causing validator timeouts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: add_version()] [Node Corruption] Can malicious or corrupted Node objects be inserted into the NodeCache without validation, and would these corrupted nodes propagate to other validators when they compute state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [LRU Corruption] If lru_cache.put() at line 81 fails silently or partially, can this result in missing nodes that validators later expect to find, causing state computation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: get_version()] [Stale Data] Can get_version() return an Arc to a NodeCache that gets modified after being cloned at line 96, causing validators to see inconsistent node data mid-computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Type: NodeCache] [NodeKey Collision] Can two different Merkle tree nodes have the same NodeKey hash, and if so, would HashMap overwrite one with the other, causing incorrect state tree traversal? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Par_iter Overhead] Can the parallel iteration overhead (lines 75-82) exceed the benefits for small caches, and could an attacker exploit this by causing frequent evictions of small caches to waste CPU resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Min_len Configuration] Can the with_min_len(100) configuration at line 79 be exploited by an attacker who ensures caches have exactly 99 nodes, forcing sequential processing and degrading eviction performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Rayon Panic] If a panic occurs in the parallel iteration closure (lines 80-82), can this crash the entire thread pool or leave the cache in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: get_version()] [Version Mismatch] Can get_version() return nodes from version N when version N-1 was requested due to off-by-one errors in the reverse iteration logic at lines 93-96? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: add_version()] [Empty Cache Allowed] Can add_version() accept an empty NodeCache (HashMap with 0 entries), and would this cause issues when validators try to compute state roots for this version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: maybe_evict_version()] [Premature Eviction] Can versions be evicted before all validators have finished using them for state computation, causing cache misses and forcing expensive disk reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: get_version()] [No Cache Warming] Does get_version() update access patterns or timestamps that could be used for smarter eviction, and can attackers exploit the FIFO eviction policy to maximize cache misses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/versioned_node_cache.rs] [Function: add_version()] [No Rollback Support] Can validators roll back to a previous version after a transaction execution failure, and if not, does this cause state inconsistencies when some validators apply a transaction and others don't?
