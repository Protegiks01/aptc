  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block replacement attack] Can a Byzantine validator replace blocks in ordered_blocks after validation but before execution, causing execution of unauthorized blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Epoch boundary] If ordered_blocks spans an epoch boundary, is there proper handling to prevent executing blocks from different epochs in the same batch, which could cause validator set inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Round monotonicity] Are block rounds guaranteed to be monotonically increasing in ordered_blocks, or can decreasing rounds cause rollback attacks or consensus safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Parent hash validation] Without checking parent_id consistency between consecutive blocks, can an attacker inject blocks that fork the chain causing state divergence between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Reference leak] When ordered_blocks is moved into the async closure at line 70, if the ExecutionWaitRequest future is never awaited, do the Arc<PipelinedBlock> references prevent blocks from being dropped, causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Weak pointer invalidation] If blocks in ordered_blocks are dropped elsewhere while execution is pending, can Weak pointers in OrderedBlockWindow become invalid causing panics in blocks() or pipelined_blocks() methods? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Circular reference] If PipelinedBlock contains Arc references that create cycles with ordered_blocks vector, can this prevent blocks from being freed even after execution completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Clone cost] Does calling b.randomness().cloned() at line 66 create expensive deep copies of Randomness data, potentially causing performance degradation or memory spikes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Lock ordering] When accessing pipeline_tx().lock() at line 65 and then potentially state_compute_result.lock() in set_compute_result(), is there a consistent lock ordering to prevent deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Mutex contention] If multiple ExecutionSchedulePhase instances process blocks concurrently, can lock contention on pipeline_tx across many blocks cause severe performance degradation affecting consensus timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Lock duration] The pipeline_tx().lock() is held during rand_tx.take() and send operations - if send() blocks or is slow, can extended lock duration cause pipeline stalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [State divergence] When set_compute_result() is called at line 73, if different validators receive different compute results due to non-determinism, will this be detected or can it cause silent state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Root hash mismatch] If set_compute_result() detects a root_hash mismatch (different from previous execution), the error is only logged - can repeated re-executions with different results corrupt the block's state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Execution summary collision] When execution_summary.set() is called, if it fails due to already being set, is the error properly propagated or can blocks have incorrect execution metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Gas accounting] If wait_for_compute_result() returns manipulated gas_used values, can this affect gas economics or allow free transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Transaction status manipulation] Can state_compute_result contain inconsistent transaction statuses (e.g., Keep vs Retry) causing some transactions to be double-executed or skipped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Error recovery] When ExecutorError is returned at line 72, is there proper error recovery or does the entire consensus pipeline halt requiring manual intervention? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [InternalError ambiguity] When wait_for_compute_result() returns InternalError with message 'Pipeline aborted', can this be confused with legitimate internal errors causing incorrect error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/pipeline/execution_schedule_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Silent failure] If rand_tx.send() fails silently (returns Err), is there logging or error handling to detect missing randomness, or does execution proceed incorrectly? (High)",
