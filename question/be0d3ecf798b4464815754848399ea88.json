  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 84-87] [Gas Fee Calculation] Does the code account for gas fees when validating that Alice has sufficient balance for transfers, or can the sum of transfer amounts (2000) plus gas fees exceed Alice's initial funding (100_000_000), causing the second transfer to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 57-60] [Faucet Funding Economics] Does the faucet impose rate limits or maximum funding amounts per address to prevent abuse, or can attackers drain the faucet by repeatedly calling fund() with different addresses, breaking devnet/testnet economics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 39-40] [Node URL Trust] Does the code verify the node's chain ID, genesis hash, or other identity information after connecting, or can DNS hijacking/BGP hijacking redirect connections to attacker-controlled nodes that return fake blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 88-91] [Transaction Censorship] If the connected fullnode censors transactions, can wait_for_transaction() wait indefinitely for a transaction that will never be included, and is there any mechanism to detect censorship or retry with a different node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Throughout] [API Version Compatibility] Does the Client::new() negotiate API versions with the node, or can API version mismatches cause silent failures, data corruption, or incorrect interpretation of transaction results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 68-138] [Balance Query Consistency] Can a malicious fullnode return inconsistent balance data across multiple queries (lines 68-74, 96-109, 125-138) to hide theft, fabricate balances, or manipulate user decisions about transfers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 47-48] [Private Key Storage] Are the LocalAccount instances storing private keys in plaintext memory throughout the program execution, and are they vulnerable to side-channel attacks (cache timing, speculative execution) that could leak key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 84-87] [Signature Verification] Does the SDK verify that the signature produced by alice.sign_with_transaction_builder() is valid before submission, or can local corruption, hardware faults, or malicious code cause invalid signatures to be submitted, wasting gas fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 84-87] [Transaction Malleability] Can the transaction hash change after signing but before submission due to signature malleability, canonical encoding issues, or witness data modifications, causing tracking issues or replay attack vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 68-91] [TOCTOU Balance Check] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between querying Alice's balance (lines 68-74) and submitting the transfer (lines 84-87), where concurrent transactions could drain Alice's balance, causing the transfer to fail with insufficient funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 84-91, 113-121] [Sequential Transfer Assumptions] Does the code assume transfers execute sequentially, or can transaction ordering in blocks, parallel execution (Block-STM), or mempool prioritization cause the second transfer to execute before the first, breaking the expected state progression? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Throughout] [Shared State Corruption] If this example code were used in a multi-threaded application with shared alice LocalAccount, could concurrent modifications to alice.sequence_number cause race conditions even with AtomicU64, due to missing synchronization of related state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 52-53] [Address Display Format] Does the .to_hex_literal() display format match the format expected by other Aptos tools and contracts, or can format inconsistencies (with/without 0x prefix, padding) cause address confusion attacks where users send funds to unintended addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Lines: 84-87, 113-116] [Transfer Amount Precision] Are transfer amounts specified in the smallest unit (octas), and is there proper handling of decimal/fractional amounts, or can rounding errors accumulate over multiple transfers causing balance discrepancies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/examples/transfer-coin.rs] [Throughout] [Example Code Security] Since this is example code that developers may copy into production applications, are there clear security warnings about practices that are acceptable for examples but dangerous in production (hardcoded URLs, no key encryption, missing error recovery)? (Low)"
