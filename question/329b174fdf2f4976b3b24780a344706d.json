  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_private_bytes()] [Error information leak] When the function returns DeserializationError, does the error message leak information about why the conversion failed that could help an attacker craft valid keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Invalid point acceptance] Does from_ed25519_public_bytes() properly validate that the Ed25519 point decompresses successfully, or could malformed inputs bypass validation and produce invalid X25519 public keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Torsion component] When converting from Ed25519 to X25519 via Montgomery coordinates, are torsion components properly handled, or could an attacker inject low-order points that weaken key exchange? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Identity mapping] Can the Ed25519 identity point or other special points be converted to problematic X25519 public keys that could compromise Diffie-Hellman operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Length check bypass] The function checks for exactly 32 bytes, but if called with memory-unsafe code, could buffer over-reads occur before the length check is performed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: public_key()] [Invalid derivation] When deriving a public key from a private key, is there any validation that the resulting public key is valid for X25519 operations, or could malformed private keys produce unusable public keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Unchecked bytes] The PublicKey struct directly stores raw bytes without validation - could an attacker construct a PublicKey with invalid curve points that would be accepted by the system but fail during Diffie-Hellman? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: as_slice()] [Mutation risk] Does as_slice() return an immutable reference, or could unsafe code mutate the underlying public key bytes, enabling key substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from() for PublicKey] [No validation] When constructing a PublicKey from a byte array, there is no validation that the bytes represent a valid curve point - could this allow injection of invalid keys into validator sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: try_from() for PublicKey] [Wrong error type] The function returns WrongLengthError for incorrect byte lengths, but should it also validate curve point validity and return DeserializationError for invalid points? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial for PublicKey] [to_bytes() cloning] The to_bytes() method clones the entire byte array - are there performance implications that could enable DoS through repeated serialization of public keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Default implementation] PublicKey implements Default, which creates an all-zero public key - is this the identity element or a weak key that should never be used in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Constant: PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE] [Size mismatch] If the PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE constant doesn't match the actual X25519 public key size, could this cause serialization bugs or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: Display for PublicKey] [Hex encoding security] The Display trait hex-encodes the public key - are there any side-channel concerns with how this encoding is performed that could leak timing information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: Debug for PublicKey] [Information disclosure] The Debug implementation shows the full public key hex value - in what contexts could this enable attackers to collect validator public keys for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Derive: DeserializeKey for PrivateKey] [Deserialization validation] When deserializing a PrivateKey from untrusted input, are there additional validation checks beyond length, or could malformed data cause the dalek library to panic or behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Derive: SerializeKey for PrivateKey] [Serialization side-effects] During serialization of PrivateKey, could the serialization process leave sensitive key material in intermediate buffers that are not properly cleared? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterialStringExt] [Hex decoding] When using from_encoded_string() to decode hex-encoded keys, are there risks of timing attacks during hex parsing that could leak information about valid vs invalid keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Constant: AIP_80_PREFIX for PrivateKey] [Prefix validation] The AIP-80 prefix 'x25519-priv-' is used for key encoding - if this prefix is not properly validated during deserialization, could an attacker substitute different key types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Constant: AIP_80_PREFIX for PublicKey] [Prefix confusion] Could an attacker craft keys with incorrect prefixes ('x25519-pub-' vs 'x25519-priv-') to cause type confusion in key management systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Derive: DeserializeKey for PublicKey] [Malformed input handling] When deserializing PublicKey from network messages, could specially crafted malformed data trigger panics or undefined behavior in the deserialization code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: try_from() for PrivateKey] [Slice bounds] When converting from &[u8] to PrivateKey, are slice bounds properly checked before copying, or could out-of-bounds access occur with attacker-controlled lengths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: try_from() for PublicKey] [Panic safety] If the try_into() conversion fails for PublicKey, does it safely return an error, or could panics propagate and crash validator nodes processing malformed network messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Dependency: x25519_dalek] [Library vulnerability] Does the code properly use the latest secure version of x25519_dalek, or could outdated versions contain known cryptographic vulnerabilities like key recovery or weak randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Dependency: x25519_dalek] [StaticSecret usage] The use of x25519_dalek::StaticSecret assumes long-lived keys - are there any security implications if keys are rotated too frequently or too infrequently in the validator network? (Medium)"
