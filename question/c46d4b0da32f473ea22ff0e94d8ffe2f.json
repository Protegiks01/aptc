  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Missing transaction type] Does the function properly handle all transaction types, or can attackers exploit unhandled transaction variants (PendingTransaction, StateCheckpointTransaction) to skip voter data extraction and cause indexer state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Default value bypass] In the wildcard pattern match at line 39, transaction version defaults to 0 and changes to empty_change - can this cause voter data from unhandled transaction types to be silently ignored, leading to incomplete indexer state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Empty changes exploitation] When transaction.info.changes is empty, the function returns an empty HashMap - can an attacker submit valid transactions with no WriteSetChanges to avoid voter updates being tracked, enabling voter manipulation without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Transaction type ordering] Are GenesisTransaction, UserTransaction, and BlockMetadataTransaction processed with consistent version numbering, or can version collision between different transaction types cause voter data overwrites? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Integer overflow] At lines 32-38, txn.info.version.0 (u64) is cast to i64 - can extremely large version numbers (> i64::MAX) cause integer overflow, resulting in negative transaction versions that break database ordering and indexer consistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Version wraparound] If transaction version exceeds 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (i64::MAX), does the cast cause wraparound to negative values, potentially allowing newer transactions to appear older and violating the last_transaction_version constraint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Struct: CurrentStakingPoolVoter] [Negative version] The last_transaction_version field is i64 - can negative values be inserted if version overflow occurs, causing database queries to malfunction when filtering by version ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Version comparison] When database updates check 'last_transaction_version <= EXCLUDED.last_transaction_version', can integer overflow cause newer updates to be rejected in favor of older data if versions wrap to negative? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Address manipulation] At lines 46-49, addresses are standardized using standardize_address() - can an attacker provide addresses with different representations (mixed case, different padding) that standardize to the same value, causing HashMap overwrites of legitimate voter data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Invalid address format] If write_resource.address.to_string() returns a malformed address (not starting with 0x, wrong length), does standardize_address() handle it safely, or can this cause panics or database constraint violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Address collision] Can two different staking pool addresses standardize to the same 66-character format, causing one staking pool's voter data to overwrite another's in the HashMap at line 50? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Case sensitivity bypass] Does standardize_address() properly normalize case, or can attackers use case variations of the same address to create duplicate entries or bypass database uniqueness constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Leading zeros manipulation] Since standardize_address() pads addresses to 64 hex characters after 0x, can addresses with varying leading zero counts be exploited to create inconsistencies between indexer state and on-chain state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Last-write-wins] At line 50, HashMap.insert() overwrites previous entries with the same staking_pool_address - if multiple WriteResource changes for the same pool exist in one transaction, does only the last one persist, potentially losing critical voter changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Multiple updates in transaction] Can a single transaction contain multiple StakePool resource writes for the same staking_pool_address with different voter_address values, and if so, which one is persisted - potentially allowing voter manipulation through transaction ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [HashMap DoS] Can an attacker create a transaction with thousands of WriteSetChanges for different staking pools, causing the HashMap to grow unbounded and exhaust indexer memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Concurrent modification] If from_transaction() is called concurrently for different transactions modifying the same staking pool, can race conditions in HashMap insertion lead to inconsistent voter state across indexer instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Resource type confusion] At line 43-45, only StakeResource::StakePool variant is processed - can an attacker create a DelegationPool resource at a staking pool address to avoid voter tracking, enabling unmonitored delegation changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Invalid resource data] If StakeResource::from_write_resource() returns Ok(Some(StakeResource::DelegationPool(_))), the code skips it - can this be exploited to hide voter changes by switching resource types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Error propagation] When StakeResource::from_write_resource() returns Err, the error is propagated with '?' - can malformed resource data cause the entire transaction processing to fail, allowing DoS of the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [None handling] If from_write_resource() returns Ok(None) for unsupported resource types, the code continues silently - can this hide critical voter updates if resource type detection fails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Partial parsing] If some WriteSetChanges parse successfully but others fail mid-iteration, does the function return a partial HashMap or propagate the error, potentially causing incomplete voter state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Empty string addresses] If inner.operator_address or inner.delegated_voter are empty strings, does standardize_address() produce valid database entries, or can this cause constraint violations?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Struct: CurrentStakingPoolVoter] [Missing validation] None of the string fields have length validation - can extremely long addresses (if standardize_address() fails) cause database VARCHAR overflow or performance degradation?
