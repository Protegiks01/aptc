  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/ip_range_manager.rs] [Integration] [Rate Limiting Bypass] If IpRangeManager is used for rate limiting, can an attacker bypass it by cycling through IPs not in the ranges, requesting unlimited tokens from the faucet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/ip_range_manager.rs] [Integration] [Allowlist Exhaustion] If used as an allowlist, can the list be exhausted by registering all allowed IPs, preventing legitimate users from accessing the faucet? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/ip_range_manager.rs] [Faucet Context] [Sybil Attack via IP Rotation] Can an attacker use IP rotation services or VPNs to bypass IP-based rate limiting and drain the faucet by creating multiple accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/ip_range_manager.rs] [Faucet Context] [Botnet Distribution] Can a botnet with thousands of unique IPs bypass IP filtering to request tokens in parallel, overwhelming the faucet's token supply? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/common/ip_range_manager.rs] [Faucet Context] [Cloud IP Exploitation] Can an attacker spin up cloud instances in different regions to obtain diverse IP ranges that bypass blocklists, draining faucet funds? (High)",
