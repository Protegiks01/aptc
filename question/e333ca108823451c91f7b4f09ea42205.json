  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/bounded_math.rs] [Error handling] [Error propagation] When signed_add() returns an error from unsigned_add() or unsigned_subtract() at lines 93, 84, 86, and 98, does the error context correctly identify which sub-operation failed for debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/bounded_math.rs] [Test coverage] [Missing edge cases] Do the tests at lines 156-219 adequately cover all edge cases, including max_value=u128::MAX, base=u128::MAX, zero values, and all sign combinations, or can untested paths harbor bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/bounded_math.rs] [Test coverage] [Concurrency testing] Are there no concurrency tests validating thread-safety of BoundedMath operations, meaning race conditions could exist that only manifest under parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/bounded_math.rs] [Test coverage] [Property testing] Does the test suite use property-based testing or fuzzing to verify arithmetic invariants (commutativity, associativity, identity), or can subtle violations go undetected? (Medium)"
