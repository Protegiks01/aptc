  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Trait: NonPanic] [Panic safety] Is the NonPanic trait implementation for DelayedFieldsSpeculativeError correct, or can certain error variants actually cause panics when unwrapped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: max_value in errors] [Bounds validation] Are max_value fields in DeltaApplication and DeltaMerge errors consistently validated against the same limits, or can different code paths use different max_value bounds for the same aggregator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: max_value in errors] [u128 maximum] Can max_value be set to u128::MAX to effectively disable bounds checking, allowing unlimited token minting or balance inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: max_value in errors] [Epoch changes] During validator epoch transitions, can max_value bounds change for existing aggregators, causing previously valid values to become invalid and break system invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Concept: Delta history] [History replay] Can an attacker manipulate delta history to replay old deltas that were already applied, causing double-counting in token supplies or staking rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Concept: Delta history] [History pruning] If delta history is pruned for old transactions, can this cause inconsistencies when verifying historical states or processing delayed operations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: min_achieved/max_achieved] [Achieved tracking] Can min_achieved or max_achieved values be manipulated to hide previous bound violations, allowing transactions that should have failed to appear valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: min_achieved/max_achieved] [Tracking reset] If achieved bounds are reset during state pruning or snapshots, can this allow attackers to bypass historical limits on aggregator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Field: min_achieved/max_achieved] [Overflow/underflow mix] Can min_overflow and max_underflow tracking be exploited to create scenarios where both overflow and underflow appear possible, causing validation confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Function: get_approximate_memory_size()] [Gas consistency] Does get_approximate_memory_size() return values that are consistent with actual gas metering, or can discrepancies allow transactions to consume more resources than they paid for? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldValue] [Conversion cost] Are conversions between Move values and DelayedFieldValue properly gas-metered, or can attackers perform unlimited conversions to waste validator compute resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldValue] [Clone cost] When DelayedFieldValue is cloned (especially Derived with large Vec<u8>), is the gas cost proportional to the data size, or can cheap clones of large data cause DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldValue] [Serialization] When DelayedFieldValue is serialized to storage, can the serialization format be exploited to create malformed stored values that cause crashes when deserialized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldValue] [State commitment] Do DelayedFieldValue variants produce consistent state commitments across validators, or can serialization differences cause state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Type: DelayedFieldValue] [Upgrade safety] If the DelayedFieldValue enum is modified in future upgrades (e.g., adding new variants), will existing stored values remain compatible, or can upgrades cause data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Error: PartialVMError] [VM error handling] When PartialVMError is returned from try_into_move_value or TryFromMoveValue, does the VM properly abort the transaction, or can error suppression allow invalid operations to proceed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/types.rs] [Error: PartialVMError] [Error context] Do PartialVMError messages contain sufficient context for debugging, or can vague errors hide the root cause of security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
