  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: BACKUP_EPOCH_ENDING_EPOCH] [Backup Progress] Does BACKUP_EPOCH_ENDING_EPOCH at line 190-196 expose backup progress information that could be used to time attacks when validators are resource-constrained during backup operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: BACKUP_TXN_VERSION] [Transaction Exposure] Can BACKUP_TXN_VERSION at line 198-204 reveal which transactions are being backed up, potentially exposing sensitive operational timing to external observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: BACKUP_STATE_SNAPSHOT_VERSION] [Snapshot Timing] Does exposing BACKUP_STATE_SNAPSHOT_VERSION at line 206-212 allow attackers to identify when validators are performing expensive snapshot operations for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: BACKUP_STATE_SNAPSHOT_LEAF_IDX] [Merkle Tree Structure] Can BACKUP_STATE_SNAPSHOT_LEAF_IDX at line 214-220 leak information about Jellyfish Merkle tree structure that could assist in crafting targeted state attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Macro: NODE_CACHE_SECONDS] [Thread-Local Aggregation] Does the make_thread_local_histogram_vec macro for NODE_CACHE_SECONDS at line 133-143 properly aggregate metrics across all validator threads, or could per-thread metrics hide anomalies in specific threads during attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Macro: COUNTER] [Thread Synchronization] Can the thread-local COUNTER macro at line 245-254 have synchronization issues where thread-local counters aren't properly flushed, causing lost metrics during node crashes or Byzantine attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [All Metrics] [Unwrap Pattern] Do all metric registrations using unwrap() (lines 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 57, 65, 77, 90, 104, 117, 130, 155, 168, 177, 185, 195, 203, 211, 219, 229, 238, 242) create crash vectors where metric registration failures cause validator node panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric Registration] [Startup Failure] If Prometheus metric registration fails for any metric due to name conflicts or system issues, can the cascading unwrap() panics prevent validator nodes from starting, causing network-wide liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Missing Metrics] [Pruning Failures] Does the file lack metrics for pruning failures or errors, potentially hiding storage corruption during pruner attacks that could lead to state inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Missing Metrics] [RocksDB Errors] Are there insufficient metrics for RocksDB error rates, potentially masking storage-layer attacks or corruption that could compromise blockchain integrity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Missing Metrics] [Backup Failures] Does the absence of backup failure metrics prevent detection of backup sabotage attacks that could make disaster recovery impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [All Lazy Metrics] [Initialization Race] Can multiple threads attempting to initialize Lazy metrics simultaneously cause race conditions in the underlying Prometheus registry, leading to duplicate metric registration panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric Updates] [Concurrent Modification] When multiple threads update metrics like COMMITTED_TXNS concurrently during parallel transaction execution, are atomic operations guaranteed to prevent metric corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: LEDGER_VERSION] [Consensus Divergence] If LEDGER_VERSION at line 40-46 is updated inconsistently across validator nodes due to race conditions, could this hide consensus divergence where different nodes have different ledger states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Metric: NEXT_BLOCK_EPOCH] [Epoch Mismatch] Can inconsistent updates to NEXT_BLOCK_EPOCH at line 48-54 across validators mask epoch transition bugs that could lead to validator set inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [Histogram Metrics] [Memory Usage] Do the histogram metrics with 22-32 buckets (API_LATENCY_SECONDS, OTHER_TIMERS_SECONDS, NODE_CACHE_SECONDS, BACKUP_TIMER) consume excessive memory when combined with multi-dimensional labels, potentially causing OOM during attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/metrics.rs] [All IntGaugeVec] [Label Memory] Can the combination of all IntGaugeVec metrics with multiple labels create unbounded memory growth when malicious components generate unique label combinations? (Medium)"
