  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: read_public_identity_file()] [Error message leakage] Do error messages from CliError::from at line 266 expose full file paths or contents that help attackers understand the system's directory structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: read_public_identity_file()] [Malformed PublicIdentity] Can from_yaml() successfully parse a file that creates a PublicIdentity with all fields set to None or invalid values, causing failures later in SetValidatorConfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: read_public_identity_file()] [Type confusion] Does from_yaml() validate that the deserialized object actually conforms to PublicIdentity structure, or can type confusion allow arbitrary struct deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: read_public_identity_file()] [File descriptor exhaustion] If read_public_identity_file() is called many times without proper cleanup, can it exhaust file descriptors and cause genesis ceremony failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: read_public_identity_file()] [Denial of read] If the file has restrictive permissions that read_from_file() cannot access, does the error handling provide enough context to diagnose issues, or can this be used to fingerprint the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [Layout default vulnerability] At line 291, Layout::default() generates default values - can these defaults be insecure (weak thresholds, open permissions, high gas limits) for production genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [File overwrite] Does check_if_file_exists() at line 290 properly prevent overwriting existing layout files, or can prompt_options be manipulated to silently overwrite critical configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [YAML bomb] Can the to_yaml() call at line 296 generate deeply nested or self-referential YAML that causes parser DoS when the layout is later loaded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [Path injection] Can output_file contain special filesystem paths (named pipes, device files, network shares) that cause write_to_user_only_file() to hang or behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [Default value tampering] If Layout::default() reads from environment variables or configuration files, can attackers pre-poison these sources to inject malicious defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [Missing validation] Does Layout::default() create a layout with valid validator set size, epoch duration, and other consensus parameters, or can invalid defaults cause genesis failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [Display trait exploitation] At line 295, output_file.display().to_string() is used - can non-UTF8 paths cause panics or injection issues in the filename string? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateLayoutTemplate::execute()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between check_if_file_exists() and write_to_user_only_file(), can an attacker create a symlink at output_file to overwrite arbitrary files with layout data? (High)",
