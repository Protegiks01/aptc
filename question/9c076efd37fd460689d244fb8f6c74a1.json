  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Resources] [HTTP Client Cleanup] Is the reqwest client in fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri properly cleaned up after each request, or do long-running observers accumulate connection handles? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Error Handling] [Partial Failures] If fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config succeeds but fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri fails, is the failure properly categorized? Can this leak information about validator network configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_observer.rs] [Error Handling] [Retry Logic] There is no retry logic for failed fetches. Can transient network issues cause validators to permanently miss JWK updates, leading to consensus divergence? (High)",
