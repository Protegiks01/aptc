  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Module Identifier Tampering] If the re-exported CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE constant is used in VM validation without additional verification, could an attacker craft transactions that reference a malicious module with the same identifier to bypass authentication checks in the core Account module? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Identifier Collision] Does the system validate that CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER ('Account') is unique across all modules, or could a malicious actor deploy a module with the same identifier at a different address to cause confusion in abort location tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Address Verification] Since CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE is constructed from CORE_CODE_ADDRESS, are there sufficient checks that this address cannot be manipulated during genesis or reconfiguration to point to a malicious implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Import Path: move_core_types::vm_status::known_locations] [Dependency Chain Attack] Could compromising the upstream move_core_types dependency allow an attacker to modify CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER or CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE definitions, affecting all authentication and account validation throughout Aptos? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Lazy Initialization Race] Since CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE uses Lazy<ModuleId> initialization, could concurrent first-time access from multiple threads cause race conditions where different threads see inconsistent module identifiers during VM startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Public Visibility] [Access Control] Are the pub use re-exports of CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE and CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER appropriately restricted, or could malicious code in other crates misuse these constants to impersonate core account module operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [String Validation] Is CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER ('Account') validated against the Move identifier rules (length limits, special characters), or could changes in the upstream definition break VM execution without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Module: account_config::constants] [Namespace Isolation] Does the constants module properly isolate these critical identifiers from other account_config submodules, or could imports accidentally shadow these constants leading to incorrect module resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Type Safety] Since ModuleId contains both address and identifier components, are there type-level guarantees preventing mixing of different module identifiers with the CORE_CODE_ADDRESS, which could create invalid module references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Abort Location Security] When core_account_module_abort() creates AbortLocation from CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE, could an attacker trigger aborts that are incorrectly attributed to the core account module to hide the true source of authentication failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Import: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Identifier Immutability] Is CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER treated as truly immutable throughout the codebase, or could unsafe code or FFI boundaries allow modification of this string, breaking all account module references? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Cache Poisoning] If CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE is cached or memoized in the VM's module cache, could an attacker poison this cache entry with a malicious module implementation during node initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Import Path] [Dependency Version Mismatch] Could version skew between move-core-types and aptos-core types create situations where CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER has different values in different compilation units, causing module resolution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Genesis State Integrity] During genesis initialization, is there verification that the actual deployed Account module at CORE_CODE_ADDRESS matches the expected CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER, or could genesis be initialized with a mismatched module? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Public Re-exports] [Symbol Conflicts] Could wildcard imports or glob re-exports from this module cause symbol conflicts with other account_config submodules, potentially leading to incorrect constant usage in authentication code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Case Sensitivity] Is the 'Account' identifier string comparison case-sensitive throughout the VM, or could an attacker deploy a module named 'account' (lowercase) that bypasses checks expecting 'Account'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Module Structure] [Circular Dependencies] Could the re-export of move_core_types constants in aptos-core types create circular dependency issues where the VM cannot properly initialize these constants during bootstrapping? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Address Canonicalization] Is CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (used in CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE construction) canonicalized consistently across all usage sites, or could different address representations cause module lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Import: known_locations] [Privileged Module Security] Since known_locations defines privileged system modules, are there runtime checks preventing non-system modules from claiming they are the CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE to gain elevated privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Serialization Security] When CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE is serialized for storage or network transmission, are there protections against deserialization attacks that could substitute a malicious module identifier? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Unicode Handling] Does the IdentStr type properly handle the 'Account' identifier string without Unicode normalization issues that could allow homograph attacks with visually similar identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Public Visibility] [Information Leakage] Could exposing CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE and CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER publicly leak information about system module structure that assists attackers in crafting targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Module Upgrade Safety] During protocol upgrades, is there validation that CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE continues to point to a compatible Account module implementation, or could upgrades break authentication by changing the underlying module? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Import Source: move_core_types] [Build Reproducibility] Are the move_core_types constants deterministically defined across different build environments, or could toolchain variations cause CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE_IDENTIFIER to have different values in different builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/account.rs] [Constant Re-export: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Dynamic Linking] If aptos-core is dynamically linked, could an attacker replace the move_core_types library to substitute malicious values for CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE, compromising all account operations? (Critical)"
