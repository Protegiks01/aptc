(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [PartialVMError Builder Pattern Attack] Does the builder pattern chain (lines 34-38) properly validate inputs at each step, or could an attacker provide malicious values that cause the builder to produce inconsistent or exploitable error states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Error Construction Race] If multiple threads construct errors using this function concurrently, could race conditions in the PartialVMError builder lead to corrupted error objects or validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [with_message Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft extremely long error messages in the original VMError that, when formatted at lines 14-17, cause the with_message() call to allocate excessive memory and DoS the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [finish() Panic Condition] Does the finish(location) call at line 38 have any panic conditions that could be triggered by malicious location data, causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Unmetered Error Processing] Since this function is used in unmetered module loading contexts, could an attacker trigger expensive error processing that bypasses gas metering and exhausts validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Debug Format Complexity] Could the {:?} formatting of complex VMError structures at line 17 trigger expensive Debug implementations that consume excessive CPU time without gas accounting?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [all_data() Cost] Is the err.all_data() call at line 27 O(1) or could it perform expensive operations on deeply nested error structures, enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [StatusType Enum Extension Attack] If new StatusType variants are added to the VMError type in a future update, could the match statement at line 12 fail to handle them correctly and fall through to the wildcard pattern at line 40?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Return Value Confusion] Could callers of this function misinterpret the returned VMError as indicating success when it actually represents a transformed verification failure, leading to incorrect error handling?
