  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Inode Exhaustion] Can repeated calls to File::create() at line 44 without cleanup exhaust filesystem inodes, preventing future config saves and causing validator failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Rollback Attack] Can an attacker with filesystem access replace current SafetyRulesConfig with an old version to rollback last_voted_round, enabling double-voting attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [No Monotonic Versioning] Does save_config() enforce monotonically increasing version numbers in SafetyRulesConfig, or can attackers downgrade configs to earlier, less secure versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config()] [Backup Restoration Attack] If validators restore from backups, does load_config() detect that SafetyRulesConfig is stale, or can this cause replayed votes violating consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [No Backup Mechanism] Does the implementation support atomic backup creation before overwriting configs, or can failed save operations destroy both old and new SafetyRulesConfig data? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config() for SafetyRulesConfig] [Swap File Exposure] Can sensitive key material from SafetyRulesConfig be written to swap space during load_config(), exposing consensus keys to disk forensics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Split-Brain Scenario] If multiple validator processes call save_config() concurrently for SafetyRulesConfig, can this create conflicting safety data causing inconsistent consensus behavior? (Critical)",
