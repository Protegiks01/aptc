(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Sigma protocol] [Zero-knowledge] Do the projection functions leak information about the ignored witness components (elgamal_randomness in HKZG projection, hkzg_randomness in ElGamal projection), breaking perfect zero-knowledge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Sigma protocol] [Completeness] Could rounding errors in field arithmetic during projection operations cause valid witnesses to be rejected, breaking the completeness property and causing DKG failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Sigma protocol] [Challenge generation] If the Fiat-Shamir transformation is used, does the DST (Domain Separation Tag) properly distinguish between HKZG and chunked_elgamal challenges to prevent cross-protocol attacks?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Line 174] [Encryption key poisoning] The eks slice contains encryption keys - if an attacker substitutes malicious keys, can they cause honest parties to encrypt to attacker-controlled keys, allowing secret theft during DKG?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Line 163] [Zero prepending rationale] The comment mentions this matches DeKARTv2 - if the zero prepending is removed but DeKARTv2 still expects it, could this cause verification failures across different implementations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/hkzg_chunked_elgamal.rs] [Line 166-169] [Witness lifetime] The Witness struct clones hiding_randomness - could the original CommitmentRandomness be mutated after cloning, causing witness inconsistency across multiple proof generations? (Low)",
