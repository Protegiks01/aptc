  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [All Non-CLI Releases] If all 30 fetched releases are non-CLI releases (missing 'aptos-cli-' prefix), the loop exhausts and returns error at line 79 - can this be exploited to DoS the update mechanism? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Missing Build Info] If cli_build_information() returns incomplete or malformed data, does the context() error at line 123 properly handle all failure cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Invalid Target String] If the match statement produces an unsupported target string, does the error at line 129 prevent further execution, or does it fall through? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Network Timeout] Are there proper timeout configurations for fetch() to prevent hanging indefinitely on slow or malicious network responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Version Metadata] Does the version parsing handle version metadata (e.g., '+build.123') correctly according to semver spec, or can metadata cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Leading Zeros] Can version components with leading zeros (e.g., '1.01.0') cause parsing issues or be exploited for version confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Major Version Jumps] Is there any protection against major version jumps that might indicate breaking changes requiring manual intervention? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: execute()] [Update Audit Log] Is there any logging of update operations (source, target version, timestamp) for security audit purposes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Failure Logging] Are update failures logged with sufficient detail for forensic analysis if a supply chain attack is suspected? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [SHA256 Checksum] Are release assets accompanied by SHA256 checksums, and if so, are they verified before binary installation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Checksum Source] If checksums exist, are they fetched from the same GitHub API endpoint (vulnerable to MITM), or from a separate trusted source? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Public Key Pinning] Is the Aptos Foundation's code signing public key pinned in the binary to prevent key substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Release Published Date] Does the code check the release published_at date to prevent installation of suspiciously backdated releases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Pre-release Flag] Does the GitHub release metadata include a pre-release flag, and if so, is it checked to avoid installing unstable builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Release Author Validation] Can the code verify that releases are published by authorized Aptos Foundation accounts, or can anyone with write access publish malicious releases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Release Notes] Are release notes parsed or validated in any way, or can malicious JavaScript/HTML in release notes exploit vulnerabilities in downstream tools? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/aptos.rs] [Function: check()] [Check Mode Side Effects] When --check is true (line 42), does the code still fetch release information from GitHub, potentially leaking version information to network observers? (Low)",
