  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker manipulate the node to report u64::MAX for latest_timeouts_count, causing integer overflow when added to allowed_consensus_timeouts in line 69, potentially bypassing the timeout check and masking consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Integer overflow] If previous_timeouts_count is close to u64::MAX and allowed_consensus_timeouts is non-zero, can the addition at line 69 overflow and wrap around, causing the comparison to incorrectly pass when it should fail, hiding consensus degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Underflow attack] Can an attacker cause latest_timeouts_count to be less than previous_timeouts_count (metric counter reset), potentially causing unexpected behavior or panic in the comparison logic, leading to checker failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Config: allowed_consensus_timeouts] [Integer overflow] Can setting allowed_consensus_timeouts to u64::MAX effectively disable timeout checking by making the condition at line 69 always false, allowing unlimited timeout increases without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Type safety] Does the u64 type provide sufficient range for cumulative timeout counts over long periods, or can legitimate long-running nodes hit u64::MAX causing counter wrapping and false positives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Constant: METRIC] [Metric name manipulation] Can a malicious node operator modify their metrics endpoint to report a fake 'aptos_consensus_timeout_count' metric with artificially low values to pass health checks while actually experiencing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: get_consensus_timeouts()] [Metric absence] If the aptos_consensus_timeout_count metric is missing (returns GetMetricResult with score 0), does the checker properly fail closed, or can nodes pass checks by simply not reporting this metric? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: get_consensus_timeouts()] [Metric parsing] Can malformed metric values (e.g., negative numbers, NaN, infinity) in the Prometheus scrape data cause parsing errors that are silently ignored, allowing invalid nodes to pass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Metric consistency] Between first_scrape and second_scrape, can a Byzantine node dynamically change its metrics endpoint to return different metric formats or sources, causing inconsistent comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: get_consensus_timeouts()] [Label injection] Does get_metric() properly validate metric labels, or can attackers inject malicious labels to select different timeout counters and manipulate which value gets checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Race condition] Between the tokio::time::sleep() at line 119 and second metrics scrape, can the node restart or reset its metrics, causing previous_timeouts_count > latest_timeouts_count and breaking the comparison logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing attack] Can a malicious node detect the delay duration from check_delay() and synchronously adjust its timeout counter just before the second scrape to barely pass the allowed_consensus_timeouts threshold? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Sleep duration] If check_delay() returns 0 or a very small duration, can both scrapes happen nearly simultaneously, capturing identical timeout values and always passing checks even on failing nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Async cancellation] If the check() async function is cancelled between first_scrape and second_scrape, can partial state persist causing incorrect results on the next check invocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Time synchronization] If the target node's system clock is manipulated (time travel attack), can timeout metrics appear to increase slower than reality, bypassing detection of actual consensus degradation?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Error silencing] When first_scrape fails at lines 105-117, the function returns early with score 0, but does this allow repeatedly failing nodes to remain in validator sets if the 'required' config is false? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Partial failure] If first_scrape succeeds but second_scrape fails at lines 121-133, does the checker properly handle this asymmetric failure, or does it allow nodes to pass by making the second scrape fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Unwrap safety] The unwrap() calls at lines 150-151 on Option<u64> assume check_results is empty, but can race conditions or logic bugs cause unwrap() on None, leading to panic and checker crash?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: get_consensus_timeouts()] [GetMetricResult handling] Does the GetMetricResult's unwrap() method at lines 139 and 142 properly populate check_results with errors, or can it silently fail allowing invalid metrics through? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty results] If both get_consensus_timeouts() calls fail and populate check_results, the function returns at line 146, but can an empty check_results vec pass through to build_check_result() causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Config: allowed_consensus_timeouts] [Misconfiguration] Can setting allowed_consensus_timeouts to 0 cause all nodes to fail checks on any timeout increase, creating false positives and excluding healthy validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Config: allowed_consensus_timeouts] [Default value] The #[serde(default)] at line 35 uses u64's default (0), which might be too strict - can this cause operational issues where all nodes fail unnecessarily? (Low)",
