  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_epoch_metrics()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads call this function concurrently during epoch change, can the increment_gauge() operation on SyncedEpochIncremental cause the counter to be incremented multiple times for the same epoch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_epoch_metrics()] [Parameter Validation] Is the reconfiguration_occurred parameter properly validated against actual blockchain state, or can incorrect values cause metric drift over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_synced_metrics()] [Integer Overflow] When converting num_synced_transactions from usize to u64, can overflow occur on 32-bit systems or when syncing extremely large transaction batches, causing incorrect metric increments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_synced_metrics()] [Metric Drift] If fetch_pre_committed_version() fails, metrics are not updated but transactions may have been committed - can this cause increasing drift between actual state and reported metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_synced_metrics()] [Race Condition] If this function is called concurrently while storage is being updated, can reading highest_synced_version race with concurrent commits causing metrics to skip versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_synced_metrics()] [Negative Values] If num_synced_transactions is 0, does incrementing by 0 have any side effects on metric aggregation or can it be used to probe metric state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Transaction Count Mismatch] Does get_num_transactions() validate that the count matches the actual transaction list length, or can a mismatch cause partial execution or incorrect metric updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Proof Validation] Is proof_ledger_info validated before being passed to storage_synchronizer, or can an invalid proof cause transactions to be executed against the wrong ledger state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Epoch Boundary] If end_of_epoch_ledger_info is provided, is it properly validated to ensure it represents a valid epoch transition, or can malicious epoch-end proofs cause network forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Error Recovery] If execute_transactions() fails after partial execution, are uncommitted transactions rolled back, or can partial state changes persist causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Notification Metadata] Does notification_metadata get properly validated, or can malicious metadata values cause the storage synchronizer to mishandle the execution request? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Gas Accounting] Are gas costs properly validated during transaction execution, or can transactions with incorrect gas costs be executed causing economic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: execute_transactions()] [Signature Validation] Does the execute_transactions call verify all transaction signatures before execution, or is signature validation assumed to be done elsewhere, potentially allowing unsigned transactions?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [Output Count Mismatch] Does get_num_outputs() correctly count all outputs including events and state changes, or can a mismatch cause incorrect state application and divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [State Root Validation] Are transaction outputs validated to ensure their state root matches the proof_ledger_info before application, or can invalid outputs corrupt the state tree? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [Write-Write Conflicts] When applying outputs, are write-write conflicts properly detected and rejected, or can conflicting outputs be applied causing non-deterministic state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [Epoch Change Validation] If end_of_epoch_ledger_info is provided with outputs, is the epoch transition properly validated against validator set rules and staking requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [Proof Verification] Does apply_transaction_outputs verify Merkle proofs for each output before application, or are proofs assumed to be pre-verified allowing invalid outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: apply_transaction_outputs()] [Atomicity] If applying outputs fails partway through, are all state changes rolled back atomically, or can partial application leave the state in an inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Struct: SpeculativeStreamState] [Concurrent Access] Is SpeculativeStreamState protected by proper synchronization primitives, or can concurrent access from multiple threads cause data races on epoch_state, proof_ledger_info, or synced_version?
