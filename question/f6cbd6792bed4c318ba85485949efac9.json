(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Certificate Validation] When code uses the MOVEY_URL constant, is TLS certificate validation properly enforced, or can an attacker with network access perform MITM attacks by presenting invalid certificates when the Move CLI connects to movey.net? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_URL] [Subdomain Takeover] If the 'movey-app-staging.herokuapp.com' subdomain (line 5) is ever decommissioned, could an attacker register the same Heroku app name and serve malicious content to users still running old debug builds? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Path Traversal] The credential path '/movey_credential.toml' in line 8 uses an absolute path starting with '/'. Can an attacker exploit path construction logic in consuming code to perform path traversal attacks and read/write credentials to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Filesystem Access] Does the code using MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH ('/movey_credential.toml' at line 8) properly validate that the credential file has secure permissions (e.g., 0600), or can any user on the system read sensitive Movey authentication credentials? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Root Filesystem Access] The path '/movey_credential.toml' (line 8) points to the root filesystem directory '/'. Can this cause permission errors, denial of service, or security issues when the Move CLI attempts to create/read this file in the system root requiring elevated privileges? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Credential Exposure] Does the hardcoded path '/movey_credential.toml' (line 8) allow multiple users on a shared system to access the same credential file, potentially exposing API keys or authentication tokens to unauthorized users? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-command-line-common/src/movey_constants.rs] [Constant: MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH] [Symlink Attack] When writing to MOVEY_CREDENTIAL_PATH ('/movey_credential.toml' at line 8), does the code check for symlinks that could allow an attacker to redirect credential writes to sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) via a symlink attack? (High)",
