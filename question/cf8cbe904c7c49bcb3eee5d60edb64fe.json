  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Serde Attribute: default] [Deserialization Bypass] Can the #[serde(default)] attribute cause security issues if partial configs are provided, where missing fields use insecure defaults that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Type Confusion] Can Serde's deserialization be exploited to provide negative values that wrap around to large positive values for u64/usize fields, bypassing intended limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Trait: Copy] [Race Condition] Does the Copy trait implementation at line 10 cause issues when NetbenchConfig is shared across threads, potentially leading to stale configuration reads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Deep Copy Issues] Is the Clone implementation safe when NetbenchConfig is cloned across thread boundaries, or could there be issues with concurrent modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Struct: NetbenchConfig] [Atomicity] Are reads of NetbenchConfig fields atomic, or could partial updates during concurrent access lead to inconsistent configuration states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Config Priority] If netbench is enabled in NodeConfig, does it take priority over other network configurations, potentially causing conflicts with consensus or state sync settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Initialization Order] Is NetbenchConfig loaded and validated at the correct stage of node initialization, or could late validation allow invalid configs to partially execute? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Network Channel Size] Does max_network_channel_size properly interact with other network buffer size configurations, or could mismatched values cause message loss or backpressure issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_config()] [Missing Test Case] Does the test verify that sanitize() rejects enabled netbench when chain_id is Some(custom_devnet_id), or only tests explicit testnet/mainnet cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_config()] [Edge Case] Does the test verify boundary values for max_network_channel_size (0, 1, u64::MAX), or only test the default happy path? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_config()] [Disabled Netbench] Does the test verify that sanitize() succeeds when netbench.enabled = false even on mainnet/testnet, confirming the early return logic? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_config()] [Node Type Validation] Should there be tests verifying netbench behavior for different NodeType values (Validator, FullNode, ValidatorFullNode)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Field: enabled] [State Confusion] Can the enabled boolean be toggled multiple times during runtime causing inconsistent netbench service state (partially initialized but disabled)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Field: enable_direct_send_testing] [Concurrent Modes] If both enable_direct_send_testing and enable_rpc_testing are set to true, does this cause resource contention or undefined behavior in the netbench service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Field: netbench_service_threads] [Thread Exhaustion] If netbench_service_threads is set to None (defaulting to num-cores), could this starve other critical system threads on nodes with limited CPU cores? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Field: direct_send_per_second] [Microsecond Precision] Is the direct_send_per_second field properly converted to microsecond intervals (comment says microseconds but field is per-second), and could this confusion lead to rate calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Field: direct_send_per_second] [Zero Value] What happens if direct_send_per_second is set to 0? Does this disable direct send testing, or cause division-by-zero errors in rate calculation code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Memory] [Allocation Size] Can the combination of max_network_channel_size * (direct_send_data_size + rpc_data_size) * rpc_in_flight exceed isize::MAX, causing allocation failures or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Memory] [Channel Capacity] Does the max_network_channel_size properly bound the total memory used by network channels, or could multiple channels each with max_network_channel_size capacity cause cumulative OOM? (High)",
