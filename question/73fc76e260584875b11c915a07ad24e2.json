  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker supply a maliciously crafted address string that bypasses Address parsing validation, potentially causing the API to access arbitrary memory locations or crash the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker request an extremely old or future ledger_version that hasn't been pruned yet, causing excessive disk I/O or memory consumption when retrieving historical state, leading to API slowdown or crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Concurrent Access] If multiple concurrent requests call get_account() with the same address but different ledger versions, can race conditions in api_spawn_blocking lead to inconsistent responses or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Fail Point Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the fail_point_poem check to bypass security validations or trigger unintended code paths by manipulating fail point configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [AcceptType Validation] Does check_api_output_enabled properly validate AcceptType, or can an attacker supply malicious accept headers to bypass output restrictions or access disabled API features? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Pagination DoS] Can an attacker craft a malicious StateKeyWrapper cursor in the 'start' parameter that causes infinite loops, excessive memory allocation, or crashes during pagination traversal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Limit Overflow] If an attacker supplies a limit value of u16::MAX (65535), can this cause memory exhaustion or integer overflow when multiplied by resource sizes during pagination? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Cursor Tampering] Can an attacker manually craft a StateKeyWrapper cursor that points to resources of a different account, bypassing access control and leaking sensitive data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly query accounts with thousands of resources using maximum limit values, causing sustained high CPU/memory usage and degrading API performance for legitimate users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Version Race] If ledger_version changes between paginated requests (no version specified), can this lead to inconsistent resource sets being returned across pages, potentially causing client-side state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [AssetType Parsing] Can an attacker supply a malformed AssetType that causes parsing errors, panics, or allows querying of unauthorized asset types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Balance Manipulation] If the balance() method has overflow vulnerabilities, can an attacker craft asset_type values that trigger integer overflows, displaying incorrect balances or causing crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Cross-Account Balance] Can an attacker manipulate the asset_type parameter to query balances from a different account's fungible stores, leaking financial information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_modules()] [Bytecode Exposure] Can an attacker use this endpoint to extract proprietary or vulnerable Move module bytecode from system accounts (0x1, 0x3, etc.), enabling reverse engineering of critical protocol logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_modules()] [Pagination Bomb] Can an attacker craft a malicious start cursor that causes get_modules_by_pagination to return overlapping or duplicated modules across pages, potentially causing cache poisoning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_modules()] [Module Size DoS] Can an attacker query accounts with extremely large modules (near max size), causing the API to allocate excessive memory when parsing ABIs or encoding responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [Version Validation Bypass] Can an attacker supply a requested_ledger_version that bypasses get_latest_ledger_info_and_verify_lookup_version checks, accessing pruned or invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [State Key Validation] If start parameter contains a malformed StateKey, can this cause parsing errors in subsequent operations that assume valid state keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [Limit Validation] Does the constructor validate that limit is within acceptable bounds, or can attackers supply 0 or extremely large values causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [Context Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate Arc<Context> references to cause use-after-free or data races when multiple Account instances access shared context concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [BCS Deserialization] Can an attacker corrupt state_value data to cause bcs::from_bytes<AccountResource> to panic or deserialize malicious AccountResource objects with invalid fields? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [Feature Flag Bypass] Can an attacker exploit race conditions in feature_enabled(DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_RESOURCE) to bypass stateless account restrictions during feature flag transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [Stateless Account Confusion] When stateless accounts are enabled, can an attacker exploit the AccountResource::new_stateless() fallback to create phantom accounts with zero sequence numbers, potentially enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [Error Information Leak] Do error messages from account_not_found expose sensitive information about account existence, sequence numbers, or internal state that aids reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [BCS/JSON Inconsistency] Can discrepancies between AcceptType::Json and AcceptType::Bcs responses cause client confusion or security issues when the same account is queried with different accept types? (Medium)"
