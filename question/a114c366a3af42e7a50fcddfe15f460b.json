  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: GAS_ESTIMATE_DEPRIORITIZED] [Label validation] Is GAS_ESTIMATE_DEPRIORITIZED constant (line 12) used without validation, allowing code bugs to accidentally record metrics under misspelled labels that don't match monitoring dashboards? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: GAS_ESTIMATE_CURRENT] [Inconsistent usage] Can inconsistent usage of GAS_ESTIMATE_CURRENT constant (line 13) across the codebase cause gas metrics to be split between 'current' and alternative spellings, hiding true gas estimation patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: GAS_ESTIMATE_PRIORITIZED] [Priority manipulation] If GAS_ESTIMATE_PRIORITIZED label (line 14) is used incorrectly in gas estimation logic, can attackers exploit discrepancies to submit transactions that bypass priority ordering mechanisms? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Static: GAS_ESTIMATE] [Estimate accuracy] Can significant deviations between GAS_ESTIMATE metrics (line 73) and actual gas consumption expose vulnerabilities in the gas estimation algorithm that attackers can exploit for underpaying gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Static: GAS_USED] [Gas accounting bypass] If GAS_USED metric (line 83) is recorded incorrectly or can be manipulated, does this indicate potential vulnerabilities in the actual gas charging mechanism that could lead to free transaction execution?
