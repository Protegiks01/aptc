  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Reference lifetime] Does the cost_table: &CostTable reference maintain valid lifetime throughout all command executions, or can dangling references occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_STORAGE_DIR] [Directory creation] When using DEFAULT_STORAGE_DIR = 'storage', does the CLI properly create this directory with secure permissions (not world-writable), or can attackers exploit insecure defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_BUILD_DIR] [Current directory] Using DEFAULT_BUILD_DIR = '.' as current directory - can this be exploited if the CLI is run from sensitive locations like /root, /etc, or system directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Move] [Default BuildConfig] When build_config uses #[clap(flatten)] without explicit defaults, can missing values cause undefined behavior or use insecure default configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Command chaining] Can an attacker chain multiple commands (e.g., New → Build → Test) to create a package, inject malicious code during build, then execute it in tests within a single CLI session? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Command] [Command ordering dependency] Do certain commands have implicit ordering dependencies (e.g., Test requires Build), and can violating these orders lead to undefined behavior or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Aptos-specific natives] When used within Aptos Core, can an attacker exploit the natives parameter to inject Aptos-specific native functions that access blockchain state, validator data, or cryptographic materials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_cli()] [Validator context] If the CLI is run on a validator node, can test execution or other commands access or modify validator keys, consensus state, or other critical security materials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_cli()] [Genesis compatibility] Does the genesis ChangeSet need to be compatible with Aptos mainnet state structure, or can incompatible test genesis data cause issues when transitioning to production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Module: base] [Module visibility] The base module is public at line 11 - can external crates import and misuse internal command implementations directly, bypassing CLI security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Module: test] [Test module exposure] The test module is public at line 12 - can production code accidentally import test utilities that have relaxed security constraints? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify_tool()] [Test coverage] The test at lines 108-112 only verifies clap command structure - does it validate security properties like input sanitization or argument bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/lib.rs] [Test: verify_tool()] [Debug assertions] Does debug_assert() at line 111 only run in debug mode, potentially missing security issues in release builds? (Low)",
