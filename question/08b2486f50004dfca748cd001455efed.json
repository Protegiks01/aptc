  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Randomness config None handling] When RandomnessConfigMoveStruct extraction fails and .ok() returns None (line 209), does from_configs handle None safely or can it cause randomness generation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Config version mismatch] Can mismatched sequence numbers between RandomnessConfigSeqNum and actual config cause observer to use wrong randomness parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [BTreeMap growth] Can the block_payloads BTreeMap grow unbounded across epochs without cleanup, causing memory exhaustion in long-running observers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Arc cycle] Can circular references between payload manager, consensus_publisher, and block_payloads prevent proper cleanup causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Config object size] Can extremely large on-chain configs (ValidatorSet with thousands of validators) cause memory pressure or allocation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: test_simple_epoch_state()] [Test coverage] Does the test verify epoch transition edge cases like concurrent access, missing configs, or malicious validator sets that could expose vulnerabilities in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: test_simple_epoch_state()] [Mock limitations] Can the test's manual state updates bypass validation logic that would execute in production, missing critical security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Zero window size] If execution_pool_window_size is set to 0 through consensus config, can this cause division by zero or infinite loops in execution pool logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: wait_for_epoch_start()] [Config deserialization] Can malicious binary data in on-chain configs cause deserialization panics or undefined behavior when extracting config structs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/epoch_state.rs] [Function: extract_on_chain_configs()] [Epoch timestamp] Does EpochState capture epoch start timestamp, and can timestamp manipulation cause consensus timing violations or timeouts? (Medium)"
