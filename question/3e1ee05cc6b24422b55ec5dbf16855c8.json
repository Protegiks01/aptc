  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsOutput] [Transaction Count Mismatch] Can the number of transactions in the vector not match the expected count from (end_version - start_version + 1), causing version accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsOutput] [Malformed Transaction] Can individual Transaction messages within the vector be malformed/invalid, bypassing validation due to protobuf's lenient parsing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsOutput] [Memory Exhaustion] Can transactions vector contain an extremely large number of transactions in a single batch, causing memory exhaustion when deserializing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsOutput] [Transaction Ordering] Are transactions guaranteed to be in version order within the vector, or can they be shuffled to cause execution order violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsOutput] [Duplicate Transactions] Can the same transaction appear multiple times within the transactions vector, causing duplicate processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [Missing INIT] Can a stream start with Data or BATCH_END without first sending INIT, bypassing initialization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [Multiple INIT] Can INIT be sent multiple times, resetting the stream state and potentially causing transaction loss or duplication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [BATCH_END Without Data] Can BATCH_END be sent without any preceding Data messages, advancing version counters without delivering transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [Data Without BATCH_END] Can multiple Data messages be sent without BATCH_END, leaving batches unclosed and causing accumulation of uncommitted transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [Premature Stream Termination] If the stream terminates mid-batch (after Data but before BATCH_END), how is partial batch data handled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Protocol: Stream State Machine] [Status/Data Interleaving] Can Status and Data messages be interleaved in unexpected patterns (e.g., INIT, Data, INIT, Data), causing state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Concurrent Stream Attack] Can multiple GetTransactionsFromNode streams be opened simultaneously with overlapping version ranges, causing race conditions in version tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Stream Cancellation] If a client cancels a stream mid-transmission, are resources properly cleaned up, or can this cause resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Stream Backpressure] If the client consumes data slower than the server produces, can this cause unbounded buffering and memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Stream Error Handling] If an error occurs mid-stream, is the stream state properly rolled back, or can partial/inconsistent data remain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Authentication Bypass] Does GetTransactionsFromNode require authentication, or can any client request transaction data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: FullnodeData] [Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting on GetTransactionsFromNode requests to prevent a single client from exhausting node resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: Ping] [Information Disclosure] Does PingFullnodeResponse expose sensitive FullnodeInfo that could be used for reconnaissance or targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: PingFullnodeResponse] [Optional Info] If info is None in PingFullnodeResponse, does this indicate a valid but uninitialized node, potentially causing connection to unstable nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Service: Ping] [Ping Flood] Can the Ping endpoint be abused for amplification attacks or to overload the node with lightweight requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Validation: StreamStatus + TransactionsOutput] Can end_version in StreamStatus claim N transactions were sent, but TransactionsOutput.transactions actually contains M ≠ N transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Validation: Request + Response Chain ID] Does the server verify that response chain_id matches the chain_id expected for the GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest connection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Validation: Stream Version Continuity] Across multiple batches, is continuity enforced (batch[i].end_version + 1 == batch[i+1].start_version), or can gaps/overlaps occur? (Critical)",
