  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Fail Crate Vulnerabilities] Does fail::cfg() have known CVEs or security issues that could be exploited through malicious name/actions strings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Global State Corruption] The fail crate uses global state - can an attacker corrupt this global state to affect other parts of the codebase that use fail_point! macros? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Failpoint Namespace Collision] Can an attacker guess or enumerate valid failpoint names by trying common patterns, then trigger critical failpoints without source code access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Action Parser Bugs] Does the fail crate's action parser have overflow, underflow, or parsing vulnerabilities when processing action strings like 'return(value)', 'panic', 'sleep', 'delay'? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Probability Manipulation] If actions include probability parameters (e.g., '50%*panic'), can an attacker use extreme values (0%, 100%, >100%) to cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Error Path Failpoints] Can an attacker configure failpoints in error handling code itself, causing panics in panic handlers and aborting the process without clean shutdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Empty String Attack] What happens when name or actions are empty strings? Can this bypass validation or trigger unexpected behavior in fail::cfg()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Duplicate Configuration] Can an attacker configure the same failpoint multiple times with conflicting actions, causing undefined behavior when the failpoint triggers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Wildcard Failpoints] Does the fail crate support wildcard/glob patterns in names? Can an attacker use '*' or '?' to enable all failpoints simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Removal Attack] Can an attacker disable existing legitimate failpoints used for testing by overwriting them with 'off' actions, breaking test infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Indexer Dependents] If external indexers depend on API reliability, can an attacker crash the API with failpoints to cause data gaps in downstream services, affecting DEXs, NFT marketplaces, or wallets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Smart Contract Interactions] Can an attacker trigger failpoints during smart contract execution to break atomic guarantees, causing partial execution and corrupting protocol state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Bridge Security] For cross-chain bridges, can an attacker use failpoints to prevent transaction finality proofs from being generated, locking funds on the bridge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/set_failpoints.rs] [Function: set_failpoint_poem()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker trigger failpoints in price feed oracles or data providers to cause stale data, manipulation, or missing updates? (Medium)"
