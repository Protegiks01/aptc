  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Trait: TConsensusMsg] [Trait bound violation] RandMessage implements TConsensusMsg but are all trait methods (epoch, from_network_message, into_network_message) properly constrained to prevent invalid implementations for malicious S/D types? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Reliable broadcast bypass] RandMessage implements RBMessage for reliable broadcast - can an attacker exploit RBMessage protocol guarantees to bypass normal verification, assuming messages are trustworthy because they passed RB validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [TOCTOU race] Between when verify() checks epoch_state.epoch and when message is actually processed, can epoch transition occur causing Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use vulnerability where message was valid when verified but invalid when processed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Config race] If rand_config or fast_rand_config are updated concurrently while verify() is running, can this cause partial verification with old config and partial with new config, leading to inconsistent security state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: from_network_message()] [Deserialization race] If multiple threads deserialize the same ConsensusMsg concurrently, can race conditions in BCS deserialization cause undefined behavior or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Share aggregation timing] Can an attacker observe timing differences in share.verify() to learn information about secret keys or influence which shares are accepted vs rejected, biasing final randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Partial verification leak] If verify() fails partway through (e.g., after checking epoch but before cryptographic validation), does error message leak information about why verification failed that can be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Randomness prediction] Can an attacker send invalid shares that fail verification in specific patterns to probe validator state and predict future randomness before it's revealed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Integration] [Network layer bypass] Can an attacker exploit differences between ConsensusMsg envelope and inner RandGenMessage to bypass network-layer authentication, allowing unauthorized nodes to inject randomness messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Integration] [Message ordering] Does the protocol handle out-of-order message delivery correctly?

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Integration] [Message duplication] Can network layer deliver duplicate RandGenMessages, and does verify() have idempotency guarantees to prevent double-counting shares or signatures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [CPU exhaustion] Can an attacker send messages that pass quick epoch check but trigger expensive cryptographic verification in share.verify() or certified_aug_data.verify(), exhausting validator CPU and degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: from_network_message()] [Memory exhaustion] Can attacker craft ConsensusMsg with extremely large data field that allocates gigabytes during BCS deserialization, causing validator OOM crash? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Struct: RandGenMessage] [Storage exhaustion] Can an attacker flood network with valid RandGenMessages that pass verification but consume unbounded storage when buffered before processing, filling validator disk? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Epoch boundary race] At exact moment of epoch transition, can an attacker send messages with both old and new epoch values such that different validators verify them differently, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Stale epoch state] If epoch_state parameter is stale (from previous epoch), can verify() succeed with old validator set allowing validators who are no longer authorized to inject randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch rollover] Can epoch counter wrap around at u64::MAX, and does this cause security issues when comparing epochs or validating message freshness? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Overall] [Share exposure] Can an attacker who compromises a validator's private key retroactively compute all historical randomness shares by replaying captured RandGenMessages, breaking forward secrecy? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Future share generation] Can an attacker request shares for future rounds via RequestShare before round starts, allowing them to precompute and bias randomness before honest validators generate their shares? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Overall] [Randomness grinding] Can a Byzantine validator selectively reveal or withhold their shares based on observed shares from others to grind randomness toward desired value, and does message verification prevent this? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Config inconsistency] If rand_config differs across validators (e.g., due to incomplete configuration sync), can this cause same message to verify differently on different nodes, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/network_messages.rs] [Function: verify()] [Fast path inconsistency] If some validators have fast_rand_config = Some() while others have None, can this cause some validators to accept FastShare messages that others reject, breaking consensus? (High)",
