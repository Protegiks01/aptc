  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/analyzed_transaction.rs] [Enum: StorageLocation::WildCardTable] [Table flooding] Can malicious transactions generate WildCardTable hints for every table in the system, forcing Block-STM to treat all table accesses as conflicting and eliminating parallel execution benefits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/analyzed_transaction.rs] [Enum: StorageLocation::Specific] [StateKey collision] Can attackers craft Specific storage locations with StateKey values that collide with system resources, causing hint-based dependencies to incorrectly identify conflicts with critical system state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/analyzed_transaction.rs] [Function: StorageLocation::into_state_key()] [Wildcard materialization] If Block-STM attempts to materialize wildcard locations into concrete StateKeys, can the panic at line 55 be triggered during normal operation, causing validator crashes?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/analyzed_transaction.rs] [Function: rw_set_for_create_account()] [Sender balance missing] Are sender coin store writes missing from the hints (since create_account likely costs gas), allowing parallel execution of conflicting sender balance updates?
