(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: advance_ms_async()] [Millisecond overflow] At line 187, Duration::from_millis(duration) with u64::MAX input creates a specific Duration - can this be used to craft attack scenarios where time advancement hits corner cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: max()] [Time comparison] At line 228, max(self.now, deadline) compares durations - can Duration's comparison implementation have edge cases with MAX values that cause incorrect results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Struct: MockTimeService] [Usage intent] The file is clearly for testing (mock service), but if production consensus code accidentally uses MockTimeService instead of real TimeService, can this cause validators to have manipulable time, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: sleep_blocking()] [Async/sync mixing] The sleep_blocking function at line 211-214 uses block_on - if consensus code path accidentally calls this instead of async sleep, can it block the executor thread and cause validator unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: poll()] [Waker clone cost] At line 389, cx.waker().clone() is called every poll - if a consensus timeout is polled repeatedly, can waker cloning overhead add up to measurable performance impact? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: trigger_min_sleep()] [Wake panic handling] At line 329, waker.wake() is called - if wake() panics (though it shouldn't), can this poison the lock and make all future operations panic, hanging consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: advance()] [Batch wakeup atomicity] Lines 248-251 wake multiple sleeps in a loop - if an earlier wake() causes the woken task to immediately create new sleeps, can the new sleeps interfere with the ongoing wakeup batch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: drop()] [Silent drop] MockSleep::drop at lines 398-405 silently unregisters - if consensus code assumes dropped sleeps still count toward pending timeouts, can this break timeout counting logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: drop()] [Drop during advance] Can MockSleep::drop() be called while advance() is iterating pending, causing the iterator to see a modified collection mid-iteration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: reset()] [Index reuse] After reset at lines 358-370, a new index is allocated at line 367 - can the old index still be referenced somewhere, causing operations on stale sleep entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: reset_until()] [Deadline validation] At lines 372-376, reset_until converts Instant to Duration - if the deadline Instant is from a different time service, can this cause incorrect duration calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: reset()] [Waker preservation] The reset function tries to preserve the waker at line 364 with flatten() - if unregister returns None (already triggered), is passing None to register_sleep safe, or can it break future polls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Tuple key ordering] The BTreeMap key is (Duration, SleepIndex) at line 67 - if Duration comparison has bugs with special values (zero, max), can this break the ordering and cause incorrect wakeup sequence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: unregister_min_sleep()] [Empty check] At line 317, keys().next() returns Option - if called on empty map, it returns None correctly, but can subsequent code handle None incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: advance()] [Deadline comparison] At line 244, deadline > self.now is used - should this be >= to handle deadline == now case correctly, or can equal deadlines be missed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: register_sleep()] [Auto-advance comparison] At line 290, deadline <= auto_advance_deadline uses <= - can deadline == auto_advance_deadline edge case cause both immediate resolution and pending registration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: advance_next()] [Non-atomic advance] advance_next at lines 222-231 gets minimum deadline, then advances time - can another thread insert a sleep with earlier deadline between these steps, breaking the 'next' semantic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: num_waiters()] [Snapshot consistency] num_waiters returns a point-in-time count - if consensus logic uses this to decide whether to wait for timeouts, can it miss sleeps that are registered immediately after the check? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: advance()] [Duration validation] advance accepts any Duration at line 233 - can negative duration (if Duration::from_secs with wrapping) or zero duration cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/mock.rs] [Function: sleep()] [Duration bounds] sleep() at line 207-209 accepts any Duration - can extremely small or large durations break assumptions in consensus timeout logic? (Medium)",
