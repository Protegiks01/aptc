  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Error swallowing] The main() function returns Result<()> but cargo may not properly fail on Err - can builds succeed with corrupted framework code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Context wrapping bypass] The .context() call adds error context but doesn't validate the underlying error - can specific error types be exploited to bypass safety checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build script privileges] Does the build script run with elevated privileges (during installation or system builds) that could be exploited to compromise the host system? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Module compilation order] Does the order of rerun-if-changed directives affect module compilation order, and can an attacker exploit ordering to bypass dependency checks in Move? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode verification bypass] After create_release() produces head.mrb, is the Move bytecode verified for safety and correctness, or can malformed bytecode slip through? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Gas metering bypass] Can an attacker craft Move source code that compiles to bytecode with incorrect gas annotations, allowing DoS through underpriced operations? (High)",
