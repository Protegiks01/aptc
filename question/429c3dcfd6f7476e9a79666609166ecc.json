  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious input_file path (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd' or absolute paths) to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive validator keys or configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Symbolic Link Attack] Does File::open() follow symbolic links, allowing an attacker to create a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g., validator private keys, system files) and read them through the node checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where an attacker could swap the input file between validation and reading, potentially injecting malicious node configurations?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a JSON file with millions of Entry objects in the Vec<Entry>, causing unbounded memory allocation and OOM crashes on validator nodes running the node checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Deserialization Type Confusion] Could malformed JSON exploit serde deserialization to cause type confusion in the Entry struct fields (e.g., providing string where number expected), leading to unsafe memory access or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Integer Overflow in JSON] Can the JSON parser handle extremely large numbers in api_port, noise_port, or metrics_port fields that exceed u16::MAX, and does it properly reject them or silently truncate causing validation bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Deserialization Validation] Does serde validation ensure that the account_address field contains only valid Aptos account addresses, or can malformed addresses cause panics or undefined behavior in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [JSON Schema Bypass] Can an attacker include extra unexpected fields in the JSON that get silently ignored by serde, potentially bypassing validation logic that should reject malformed entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Allowlist Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the account_address_allowlist check by providing account addresses in different formats (e.g., with/without 0x prefix, different case, different length padding) that pass allowlist check but resolve to different actual addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Empty Allowlist Interpretation] Does an empty account_address_allowlist (is_empty() returns true) correctly mean 'allow all addresses', and could this create an unintended open registration system allowing any attacker node to register? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Allowlist String Comparison] Does the allowlist comparison use account_address.to_string() which might have different formatting than the allowlist entries, creating bypass opportunities through format inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Case Sensitivity Attack] Is the allowlist comparison case-sensitive, and can attackers bypass it by using different case variations (0xABC vs 0xabc) if AccountAddress::to_string() normalizes differently than allowlist entries?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Protocol Validation Missing] Does the code validate that only http:// or https:// schemes are allowed in node_url, or can attackers specify ws://, ftp://, or other protocols causing unexpected behavior in node checking logic?
