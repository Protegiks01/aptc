  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Recovery] When TooManyRequested error is encountered, does retry logic properly back off or could aggressive retries by malicious client amplify DoS impact on storage layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Pruning Verification] Does MissingRootError handling verify that version is actually below pruning window vs accepting missing data from unpruned range that indicates corruption? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Transaction Finalization] If IoError occurs during transaction commit finalization, does error handling ensure transaction is either fully committed or fully rolled back, preventing partial state updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Validator Performance] Can repeated non-critical errors (ParseIntError, BcsError on malformed input) degrade validator performance through logging/metrics overhead, enabling performance-based DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [State Fork Detection] If NotFound error indicates missing state that other validators claim exists, does error handling trigger fork detection protocol vs silently retrying until state arrives? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Delegation Safety] When errors occur in delegated storage operations (background pruning, snapshot generation), does error propagation ensure main consensus thread is notified vs silent failure? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Code Exhaustion] With only 10 error variants defined (lines 14-35), are there failure modes that don't map cleanly to any variant and get incorrectly classified as Other, losing critical diagnostic information? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Cross-Version Compatibility] If error enum is extended in future versions, could old validators misinterpret new error variants sent over network, causing protocol compatibility issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Governance Bypass] Can storage errors during governance proposal execution be exploited to cause partial execution of proposal, bypassing safety checks and enabling unauthorized protocol changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Staking Corruption] If storage errors occur during stake reward distribution, could this result in incorrect reward amounts being recorded, enabling inflation attacks or theft of staking rewards? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Account State] Can NotFound error for account state be distinguished from account never created vs account deleted vs storage corruption, and could confusion enable unauthorized account recreation? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Module Publishing] If BcsError occurs during Move module deserialization at publish time, does error handling prevent partially valid modules from being committed to chain state? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Event Emission] Can storage errors during event emission cause events to be lost without transaction failure, breaking invariant that committed transactions always emit their declared events? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Table Operations] When TooManyRequested error occurs on table queries, does limit enforcement happen before or after expensive merkle proof generation, and could this be exploited for DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Version Linearization] If ParseIntError occurs parsing ledger version, could validator read non-linearized version ordering that breaks causality invariants in transaction history? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Checkpoint Integrity] Can RocksDbIncompleteResult during checkpoint creation result in checkpoint that passes basic validation but contains subtly corrupted state that diverges over time? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Resource Cleanup] Do all error return paths properly clean up storage locks and transactions, or could error cases leave locks held, causing deadlock that halts all storage operations? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Backup Verification] When NotFound errors occur during state backup, does error handling ensure backup is marked incomplete vs accepting partial backup that appears valid but missing data? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Replay Attack] Can storage errors during transaction validation be exploited to cause same transaction to be validated multiple times with different results, enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [State Versioning] If MissingRootError indicates truly missing (never existed) version vs pruned version, could confusion enable queries at impossible versions that should fail but return stale data? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Metrics] Are error types properly distinguished in monitoring metrics, or could high-severity errors (state corruption) be masked by high volume of low-severity errors (not found)? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Clone Implementation] [Thread Safety] Does the Clone derive at line 11 ensure error instances can be safely shared across threads, or could cloned error instances sharing mutable state cause race conditions in error handlers? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/errors.rs] [Debug Implementation] [Information Leakage] Does the Debug derive at line 11 expose sensitive internal state in error debug output that could leak to logs, enabling attackers to reconstruct storage internal structure? (Low)"
