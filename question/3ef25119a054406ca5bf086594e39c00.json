  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Public API safety] Since `pack()` is public, can external crates create malicious `Any` objects that violate invariants expected by Aptos core code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Public API abuse] Since `unpack()` is public, can external code attempt to unpack `Any` objects with system-critical type names, potentially bypassing access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Trait: AsMoveAny] [Trait visibility] The `AsMoveAny` trait is public - can third-party crates implement this trait incorrectly or maliciously, breaking security assumptions when their types are converted to `Any`? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: AsMoveValue::as_move_value()] [AsMoveValue trait abuse] Can malicious implementations of `AsMoveValue` for `type_name` or `data` fields produce invalid `MoveValue` structures that crash the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Schema evolution] If the `Any` struct needs additional fields in future (e.g., version number, checksum), will old serialized `Any` objects remain deserializable, or will this break backward compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [BCS version pinning] Is the BCS library version pinned to ensure packed data remains unpackable across Aptos version upgrades, or can BCS changes break historical data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Soft fork compatibility] If `unpack()` logic changes in a soft fork, can validators running old code and new code process the same `Any` objects differently, causing consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Move function interop] When `Any` objects are passed to Move functions, can malicious Move code exploit pack/unpack to violate Rust type invariants or access uninitialized memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Resource safety bypass] Can attackers use `Any` to pack Move resources (which should not be copyable) and later unpack multiple copies, violating Move's linear type system and enabling resource duplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Trait: AsMoveAny] [Ability bypass] If Move types have specific abilities (copy, drop, store, key), can `Any` bypass these restrictions by packing types that shouldn't be storable and storing them anyway? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Generic instantiation attack] Can attackers pack generic Move types with malicious type arguments (e.g., `Any<Signer>`) to gain unauthorized capabilities when unpacked? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Insufficient error cases] Does `unpack()` properly handle all possible BCS deserialization errors (incomplete data, invalid enums, out-of-range integers), or can some errors cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Missing size limits] Are there integration tests that verify `Any` objects cannot exceed reasonable size limits (e.g., 1MB) to prevent resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Fuzzing coverage] Has this code been fuzzed with arbitrary `type_name` and `data` combinations to discover edge cases or crashes? (Low)"
