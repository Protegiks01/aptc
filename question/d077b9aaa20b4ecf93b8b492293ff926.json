  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: governance] [Governance Module Import] Does the governance module import enforce proper access controls, or can governance functions be called in unintended contexts, bypassing proposal voting requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: stake] [Stake Module Import] Can the stake module be accessed inappropriately through the CLI to manipulate validator sets, stake amounts, or reward distributions without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: node] [Node Module Import] Does the node module expose node management functions that should be restricted to operators only, allowing unauthorized users to modify node configurations or restart validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: move_tool] [Move Tool Import] Can the move_tool module be exploited to compile malicious Move code, bypass module verification, or deploy contracts that violate safety invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: account] [Account Module Import] Does the account module properly validate account operations, or can it be used to create privileged accounts, bypass authentication, or manipulate account balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async Executor] Are the async executors properly configured with timeout limits, or can long-running subcommands block indefinitely, causing resource exhaustion or denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Concurrent Execution] Can multiple CLI commands be executed concurrently on the same local state, potentially causing race conditions in file I/O, database access, or key management? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Trait: CliCommand] [Type Confusion] Can the CliCommand trait implementation allow type confusion attacks where incorrect result types are returned, leading to deserialization errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Propagation] Are error types from different subcommands properly isolated, or can errors from one tool leak information about the internal state of other tools or modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 69: Init Tool] [Initialization Attack] Can the Init tool be exploited to overwrite existing configurations, replace validator keys, or modify critical settings during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 76: Workspace Command] [Workspace Escape] Does the execute_serialized_without_logger() method for Workspace commands properly sandbox operations, or can it be used to escape the workspace directory and access sensitive files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: common] [Common Utilities] Do the common utilities imported (CliCommand, CliResult, CliTypedResult) properly sanitize all inputs and outputs, or can they introduce injection vulnerabilities across all CLI tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: op] [Operations Module] Does the op module (which includes KeyTool) properly protect cryptographic operations, or can it be exploited for key extraction, weak key generation, or signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: update] [Update Module] Can the update module be exploited to downgrade software versions, bypass security patches, or install compromised binaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: workspace] [Workspace Module] Does the workspace module properly isolate workspace operations, or can it be used to access or modify files outside the workspace, including system files or validator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Test Function: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage] Does the verify_tool() test function provide adequate coverage for security-critical command paths, or can vulnerabilities exist in untested code branches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [CliResult Type] Can the CliResult type be manipulated to return success when operations actually failed, masking errors that could lead to inconsistent state or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 67: execute_serialized] [Serialization Format] Does execute_serialized() use a secure serialization format that prevents deserialization attacks, or can malicious payloads exploit parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 69: execute_serialized_success] [Success Manipulation] Can the execute_serialized_success() method be exploited to report success for operations that should have failed, leading to inconsistent state or bypassed validations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Tool] [Command Ordering] Does the order of command variants in the Tool enum affect parsing or execution, potentially allowing command shadowing or precedence attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Match Exhaustiveness] Is the match statement in execute() exhaustive and properly handling all Tool variants, or could new variants be added without proper security review? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 55: hide attribute] [Hidden Commands] Can the hide(true) attribute on the Workspace command be bypassed to expose hidden functionality, or does it only affect help text display? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Module: config] [Config Module Security] Does the config module properly validate and sanitize configuration files, or can malicious configs introduce backdoors, modify security settings, or corrupt node state? (High)"
