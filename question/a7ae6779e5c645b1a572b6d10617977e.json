  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide an extremely large positive expiry_offset_secs value that causes integer overflow when cast from i64 to u64 on line 69, resulting in transactions with near-zero expiry times that immediately expire? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Integer Underflow] Can an attacker supply a very large negative expiry_offset_secs (e.g., i64::MIN) that causes integer underflow when negated on line 74 as (-offset), potentially wrapping around and creating far-future expiry times that never expire? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Time Manipulation] Does the function properly validate that negative expiry_offset_secs values don't result in expiry times before the Unix epoch (before 1970), which could cause undefined behavior or transaction acceptance issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Arithmetic Overflow] When adding Duration to SystemTime on lines 68-70, can an attacker cause a panic or overflow by providing offset values near u64::MAX that exceed SystemTime's maximum representable value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the lack of bounds checking on expiry_offset_secs to create transactions with expiry times thousands of years in the future, potentially causing storage bloat or validator resource exhaustion when tracking pending transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Clock Skew Attack] If SystemTime::now() differs significantly across different nodes or between CLI and server, can this create race conditions where transactions are considered expired on some nodes but valid on others, causing consensus disagreement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Edge Case] What happens when expiry_offset_secs is exactly 0? Does this create immediate expiry, and could attackers use this to force transaction failures while still consuming sequence numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Type Conversion] The cast from i64 offset to u64 on lines 69 and 74 is unchecked - can this lead to silent truncation or sign extension issues on different platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker omit the optional sender field (line 100) and rely on private key derivation alone, potentially creating accounts when the private key was rotated and no longer matches the intended sender address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Account Collision] Is there validation to prevent creating an account at an address that already exists? Could an attacker exploit this to overwrite existing account state or confuse account ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Replay Attack] If sequence_number is provided explicitly (line 49), can an attacker replay this transaction creation command with the same parameters after key rotation to create unintended accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Gas Manipulation] When max_gas (line 54) is not provided, does the server estimation prevent an attacker from creating accounts with insufficient gas, causing failed transactions that still consume sequence numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Private Key Extraction] The private_key is extracted on lines 111-113 using extract_private_key - does this properly validate encoding options to prevent loading malicious keys or extracting keys from unintended profiles? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Address Validation] The new_account address is loaded via load_account_arg (line 102) - does this prevent attackers from specifying system addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.) that should not be user-creatable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [State Corruption] If account creation fails midway (e.g., after debiting gas but before creating account), can this lead to inconsistent state where funds are lost without account creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker create massive numbers of accounts with minimal stake to exhaust state storage or bloat the account tree, causing validator performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Amount Overflow] The amount field (line 156) is u64 - can an attacker specify u64::MAX to cause overflow when combined with gas fees or other operations, potentially minting unlimited funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Insufficient Balance] Does the transfer properly check sender balance before execution, or can an attacker initiate transfers exceeding their balance, causing failed transactions that still consume sequence numbers and gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Currency Manipulation] The currency is parsed via parse_currency (line 162) from JSON - can an attacker inject malicious currency metadata to transfer non-native coins disguised as native APT? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Self-Transfer] Is there validation to prevent sender == receiver transfers? Could such transfers be exploited for sequence number manipulation or fee extraction without actual value transfer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Zero Amount] Can an attacker execute zero-amount transfers to manipulate sequence numbers, create spam transactions, or exploit logic that assumes positive transfer amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Receiver Validation] Does the command validate that the receiver address is not a forbidden system address or smart contract that doesn't accept direct transfers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Account Creation] The comment mentions 'It will create the account if it does not exist' (line 132) - can an attacker exploit this to force unwanted account creation for arbitrary addresses, potentially causing storage bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Gas Price Manipulation] When gas_price is explicitly provided (line 59), can an attacker set it to zero or near-zero to execute transfers with negligible fees, undermining the economic security model? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Sender Confusion] When the optional sender field differs from the derived address from private_key, which one is actually used for the transaction? Can this create authorization confusion? (High)"
