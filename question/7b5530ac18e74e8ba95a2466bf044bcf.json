  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Visibility control] Are the re-exported types (EntryPoints, LoopType, MapType, MonotonicCounterType, MoveVmMicroBenchmark, OrderBookState) from move_workloads module at lines 11-13 properly scoped to prevent unauthorized access to internal test workload generation functions that could be misused in production environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Module dependency] Does the unconditional public re-export of TokenWorkflowKind from token_workflow module at line 14 expose sensitive workflow construction logic that could be exploited to craft malicious transaction sequences in testing environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Unsafe code policy] The #![forbid(unsafe_code)] directive at line 4 prevents unsafe blocks in this crate, but does this restriction extend to all re-exported dependencies (move_workloads, token_workflow, prebuilt_packages) to ensure no unsafe operations can bypass safety checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Module isolation] The private module declarations (args, move_workloads, prebuilt_packages, token_workflow) at lines 6-9 hide internal implementation, but can an attacker use Rust's module system or trait implementations to access private functions through the public re-exports? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Type re-export security] The pub use statements at lines 11-14 make internal types publicly accessible - could this exposure allow external crates to instantiate OrderBookState or EntryPoints variants in ways that violate invariants expected by the internal implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Dependency chain] Since this file re-exports from prebuilt_packages module which loads binary data (prebuilt.mpb), could an attacker who compromises the build process inject malicious Move bytecode that gets deserialized when this library is imported? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/lib.rs] [Public API surface] By re-exporting complex enums like EntryPoints and MoveVmMicroBenchmark, does the library expose sufficient validation at the API boundary to prevent callers from constructing invalid workload configurations that could crash validators during testing? (Low)"
