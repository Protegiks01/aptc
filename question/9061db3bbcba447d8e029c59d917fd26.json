  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function] [Resource cleanup] If start_peer_monitor crashes or panics, is the spawned metadata updater task (from spawn_peer_metadata_updater) properly cleaned up, or does it become an orphaned background task consuming resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Cross-function] [State machine] Can the state transitions (create state -> use state -> garbage collect state) be exploited with carefully timed peer connections/disconnections to cause use-after-free or double-free scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Configuration] [Integer overflow] Can peer_monitor_interval_usec overflow when converted to Duration::from_micros (line 106), causing unexpected timer behavior or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Configuration] [Time manipulation] Can the monitoring_service_config be manipulated to contain inconsistent interval values between peer_monitor_interval_usec and metadata_update_interval_ms, causing timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Configuration] [Validation missing] Are there bounds checks on node_config values before use, or can extreme configuration values cause arithmetic overflows, division by zero, or resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Configuration] [Malicious config] Can a compromised configuration file inject malicious parameters that cause the peer monitoring service to report false information about peer health, manipulating peer reputation and selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Network interaction] [Peers and metadata] Can malicious implementations of get_connected_peers_and_metadata() return crafted peer lists or metadata that bypass monitoring checks or cause incorrect state management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Network interaction] [Metadata updates] Can the update_peer_monitoring_metadata call (line 252-253) be exploited to inject false monitoring data that manipulates the global peer reputation system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Network interaction] [PeerNetworkId] Are PeerNetworkIds properly validated and sanitized before being used as HashMap keys, or can malicious peer IDs cause hash collisions, HashMap performance degradation, or key confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Network interaction] [Peer metadata] Can crafted PeerMetadata objects from connected_peers_and_metadata contain malicious data that exploits downstream consumers when passed to PeerState::new() or refresh_peer_states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Error handling] [Error suppression] Does the pattern of logging errors and continuing (lines 122-128, 151-155) allow accumulated errors to hide systemic failures that should halt monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Error handling] [Panic propagation] If functions called in the monitoring loop panic (e.g., garbage_collect_peer_states, create_states_for_new_peers), does this kill the entire monitoring service without recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Error handling] [Async error handling] Are errors in spawned async tasks properly propagated and logged, or can silent failures in peer state refresh or metadata updates go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Error handling] [Result unwrapping] Are there any hidden .unwrap() or .expect() calls in dependencies that could panic the monitoring loop on unexpected inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Memory management] [HashMap growth] Can the peer_states HashMap grow unbounded if garbage_collect_peer_states is never called or fails, causing memory exhaustion on validators with high peer churn? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Memory management] [Clone operations] Are the multiple clone operations (peer_monitor_state.clone(), peer_monitoring_client.clone(), time_service.clone()) in lines 145-149 efficient, or can they cause excessive memory allocation under high load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/lib.rs] [Memory management] [Arc reference counting] Can circular references between Arc-wrapped structures cause memory leaks where peer states are never freed even after garbage collection? (Medium)",
