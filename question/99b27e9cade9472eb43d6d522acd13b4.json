  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Pool fragmentation] Repeated take/add cycles at lines 44-45 and 54 can fragment the underlying Vec in ObjectPool - can this cause memory fragmentation or reallocation overhead in long-running tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Send/Sync safety] The struct is wrapped in Box<dyn TransactionGenerator> which requires Send + Sync - is StdRng at line 15 properly Send+Sync, or can moving the generator across threads cause data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Borrow checker bypass] The &mut self parameter at line 38-42 allows mutable access to rng at line 45, but accounts_to_use borrows accounts immutably - are there hidden borrow checker conflicts that could cause UB in unsafe code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Lifetime issues] The generator at line 16 is Box<dyn TransactionGenerator> with no explicit lifetime - if the inner generator captures references, can lifetime issues cause dangling references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: new()] [Move semantics] The constructor takes generator: Box<dyn TransactionGenerator> by value at line 24 - if the caller expects to retain ownership, will the move semantics cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Comment accuracy] The comment at lines 9-13 states accounts are 'burned (removed from the pool)' and used 'only once', but line 54 adds them to destination_accounts_pool for reuse - is the comment outdated or misleading? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Implicit behavior] The behavior when destination_accounts_pool is None (accounts are truly burned) vs Some (accounts are recycled) is not documented - can this cause confusion for users integrating this wrapper? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Return_partial flag] The take_from_pool() call at line 45 passes return_partial=true, but the implications of partial returns (fewer accounts than requested) are not documented - can this cause unexpected behavior in callers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Pool exhaustion handling] The early return at line 47 when pool is empty provides no error context - should this log a warning, emit metrics, or provide debugging information for troubleshooting? (Low)"
