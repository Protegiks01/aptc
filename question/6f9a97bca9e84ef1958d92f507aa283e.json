  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious package path through move_options.get_package_path() that uses '../' sequences to read .coverage_map.mvcov files from arbitrary directories outside the intended package, potentially exposing sensitive coverage data or causing unauthorized file access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Arbitrary File Read] In the CoverageMap::from_binary_file() call at line 200, can an attacker craft a symbolic link named .coverage_map.mvcov that points to sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, private keys), causing the deserialization to leak file contents through error messages or timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Deserialization Attack] Does CoverageMap::from_binary_file() at line 200 validate the binary format before deserialization, or can a malicious .coverage_map.mvcov file containing crafted BCS-encoded data trigger buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, or memory corruption in the deserialization logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted .coverage_map.mvcov file with extremely large coverage data structures (e.g., billions of entries) that exhausts memory during from_binary_file() deserialization at line 200, causing denial of service on the developer's machine? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Integer Overflow] If the .coverage_map.mvcov file contains coverage data with extremely large instruction counts or module indices, could integer overflow occur during deserialization or subsequent processing in CoverageMap::from_binary_file(), leading to incorrect coverage calculations or memory safety issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Compiler Config Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate move_options fields (bytecode_version, compiler_version, language_version) at lines 182-191 to force compilation with vulnerable or deprecated compiler versions that have known bugs, potentially causing incorrect bytecode generation or security vulnerabilities in the compiled output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Attribute Injection] In the BuildConfig at line 180, known_attributes uses extended_checks::get_all_attribute_names() - can an attacker inject malicious attribute names through environment variables or configuration files that bypass security checks when skip_attribute_checks is enabled, allowing unauthorized compiler directives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Named Address Injection] Does move_options.named_addresses() at line 174 properly validate named address mappings, or can an attacker inject addresses that conflict with system addresses (0x1, 0x2, etc.), potentially causing the compiler to generate bytecode that violates Move's address space isolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Directory Traversal in install_dir] Can the install_dir field from move_options.output_dir at line 177 be manipulated to write compilation artifacts to arbitrary system directories through '../' path traversal, potentially overwriting critical system files or planting malicious code in privileged locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Git Dependency Confusion] When skip_fetch_latest_git_deps is false at line 178, can an attacker perform a dependency confusion attack by hosting a malicious git repository that replaces legitimate Aptos framework dependencies, causing compilation with backdoored Move modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Compiler Experiments Exploitation] Does move_options.compute_experiments() at line 192 validate experimental compiler flags, or can an attacker enable dangerous experimental features that disable safety checks, type verification, or resource linearity enforcement in the Move compiler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Error Message Information Leak] At line 201-202, when CoverageMap::from_binary_file() fails, does the error message leak sensitive file system paths, internal data structures, or stack traces that could aid an attacker in reconnaissance for further attacks on the build system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Compilation Error Leak] At line 205, when compile_package() fails, does the MoveCompilationError leak source code fragments, internal addresses, or cryptographic material that should remain confidential in a production environment? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [Race Condition] If multiple concurrent processes call compile_coverage() on the same package directory, can race conditions in reading .coverage_map.mvcov or writing compilation artifacts cause file corruption, incomplete coverage data, or build failures that mask real test failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: compile_coverage()] [TOCTOU Vulnerability] Between checking the path with get_package_path() at line 198 and reading the coverage file at line 200, can an attacker modify the .coverage_map.mvcov file through a symlink swap (TOCTOU attack), causing the function to read different data than expected and potentially leak sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Filter Injection] Can the filter string parameter at line 48-51 contain regex metacharacters or special characters that cause unexpected behavior in the contains() comparison, potentially bypassing module filtering and exposing coverage data for modules that should be hidden? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Resource Exhaustion via Filter] Can an attacker provide a malicious filter string that causes catastrophic backtracking or performance degradation when matching against module names, leading to denial of service during coverage report generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Type Confusion] At lines 53-58, the code assumes all CompiledUnits are Modules when filtering - if a non-Module unit somehow passes the filter_map, could this cause a panic in the module.clone() operation or subsequent coverage processing?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Memory Exhaustion] If the compiled package contains thousands of large modules, can the modules.collect() operation at line 60 exhaust available memory, causing the coverage tool to crash before generating any output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/coverage.rs] [Function: SummaryCoverage::coverage()] [Clone Performance Attack] At line 55, module.clone() creates deep copies of potentially large module bytecode - can an attacker craft Move modules with extremely large constant pools or function bodies that cause excessive memory allocation and performance degradation during cloning?
