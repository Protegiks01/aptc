  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro hygiene] [$crate hygiene break] If the $crate::... prefix is not consistently used (lines 56-67, 155-255), can macro invocations from external crates resolve to wrong types, causing type confusion vulnerabilities in logging code used by consensus modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro expansion] [Compile-time DoS] Can attackers provide source files with extremely long identifier chains (e.g., $($k).+) that cause exponential macro expansion times, preventing validator code from compiling and delaying security patches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro expansion] [Token tree explosion] Can nested schema! or fmt_args! macro calls cause token tree explosion during compilation, consuming excessive memory and preventing validators from being built on resource-constrained systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Feature flags] [Build inconsistency] Can inconsistent feature flag settings across different validator builds cause some validators to use the tokio-console unwrap variant (lines 17-48) while others use the standard variant (lines 6-15), leading to divergent panic behavior and network partitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Feature flags] [Feature detection bypass] Can attackers manipulate the compilation environment to enable the tokio-console feature on validators that should run the standard variant, introducing unwrap panics that don't exist in the intended production configuration?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 23] [Unwrap panic] Can the .unwrap() call after tokio::task::Builder::new().name($name).spawn($func) panic if the tokio runtime is shutting down, causing validator crashes during graceful shutdown and potentially corrupting consensus state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 27] [spawn_on unwrap] Does the .unwrap() after spawn_on($func, $handle) on line 27 properly handle cases where the target executor has been dropped, or can this cause validator panics when attempting to spawn tasks on terminated thread pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 56-61] [Metadata construction] Is the Metadata::new() constructor guaranteed to be const-evaluable, or can runtime dependencies in env!(), module_path!(), file!(), or line!() cause compilation failures or introduce non-determinism across validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 63] [TOCTOU race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use race between METADATA.enabled() returning true and Event::dispatch() executing, allowing log levels to change mid-execution and causing logs to be emitted at wrong levels or suppressed inconsistently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 66] [Format args evaluation order] Does the fmt_args!($($args)+) evaluation on line 66 have guaranteed ordering relative to schema!($($args)+) on line 67, or can compiler reordering cause arguments with side effects to execute in wrong order, corrupting validator state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 155] [from_serde panic] Can Value::from_serde(&$val) panic for certain types, and if so, does this panic occur within a macro expansion where panic handling is disabled, causing validator crashes during log generation in consensus code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 169] [from_debug safety] Does Value::from_debug(&$val) safely handle types with malicious Debug implementations that access global state, acquire locks, or perform I/O operations, potentially introducing deadlocks or side effects in validator logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 183] [from_display side effects] Can Value::from_display(&$val) trigger arbitrary code execution through Display trait implementations, allowing logged values to modify consensus state, send network messages, or leak cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Line 239] [Schema reference] Does the lone schema case (&$schema) on lines 237-247 validate that $schema is actually a valid Schema type, or can attackers pass arbitrary references that cause type confusion when the schema array is constructed? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: log] [Double evaluation] Since the log! macro can evaluate $($args)+ multiple times through both fmt_args! and schema!

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Trailing comma handling] Do the $(,)* patterns in the schema macro (lines 132-255) correctly handle all combinations of trailing commas, or can specific comma patterns cause macro expansion failures that prevent validators from compiling security-critical code?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Log level manipulation] Can Byzantine validators manipulate their log levels to suppress security events (like double-signing attempts) while appearing to have normal logging configuration, hiding malicious behavior from monitoring systems?
