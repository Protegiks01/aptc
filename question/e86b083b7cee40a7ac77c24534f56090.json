  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Function: gather_metrics()] [Consistency guarantees] Does gather_metrics() provide a consistent snapshot of all metrics at a single point in time, or can metrics change during iteration, causing inconsistent scrape data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Line 16] [Partial results] If aptos_metrics_core::gather() fails partway through collection, does it return partial results or empty Vec, and can this cause misleading metrics that appear as sudden drops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Function: gather_metrics()] [Untestable state] The function has no dependency injection and directly calls global functions - can this make it difficult to test edge cases like metric registry failures or corrupted data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Line 23] [Threshold coverage] Is the 2000 dimension threshold tested with edge cases like exactly 2000, 2001, and u64::MAX dimensions to ensure correct boundary behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Line 34] [Overflow testing] Are there tests that verify saturating_add() correctly prevents overflow when total exceeds u64::MAX, and that the metric counter remains meaningful? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Function: gather_metrics()] [Concurrency testing] Have race conditions been tested with concurrent gather_metrics() calls, metric registrations, and counter updates to ensure thread safety? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Static: NUM_METRICS] [Cardinality explosion] In production, can the single 'type' label lead to unbounded cardinality if new metric types are dynamically created, causing Prometheus server memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Line 26-32] [Production logging] Can the warning logs be triggered frequently enough in production to cause log rotation issues, disk space exhaustion, or log shipping costs to become significant? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Function: gather_metrics()] [Hot path performance] If gather_metrics() is called frequently (e.g., every 15 seconds by multiple Prometheus instances), can the cumulative CPU/memory overhead impact faucet service availability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/gather_metrics.rs] [Line 38-41] [Metric reset strategy] The monotonically increasing counters never reset - can this cause operational issues when interpreting metrics over long time periods (weeks/months), as the values grow unbounded? (Low)"
