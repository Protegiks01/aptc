  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Export] [Access Control] Are all module re-exports at lines 44-72 appropriately scoped with correct visibility modifiers, or could internal configuration details be exposed to external callers through overly permissive 'pub use' statements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Declaration] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker exploit the module declaration order (lines 6-41) to inject malicious configuration modules before critical security modules like 'safety_rules_config' or 'secure_backend_config' are loaded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Safety Rules Bypass] Is the public re-export of 'safety_rules_config' at line 68 properly restricted, or can non-validator nodes manipulate safety rules configurations leading to consensus safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Secure Backend Exposure] Does the public re-export of 'secure_backend_config' at line 69 expose sensitive cryptographic key storage configurations that could allow attackers to discover or manipulate validator private key locations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Loading] [Race Condition] Can concurrent access to the re-exported modules (lines 44-72) during node initialization create race conditions where partially initialized configurations are used, leading to validator misbehavior or consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Config Sanitizer] [Validation Bypass] Is the 'config_sanitizer' module (line 10) properly loaded before other configuration modules, or can attackers load unsanitized configs by exploiting module initialization order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Config Optimizer] [Manipulation] Can the 'config_optimizer' module (line 9) be manipulated to override security-critical configuration values set in 'node_config_loader', potentially weakening validator security on mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] [Information Disclosure] Are internal modules like 'config_sanitizer' and 'config_optimizer' (lines 9-10) kept private to prevent external code from bypassing config validation, or could they be accessible through Rust's module system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Consensus Config Tampering] Does the re-export of 'consensus_config' at line 47 allow external modification of critical consensus parameters like timeout values or quorum thresholds that could halt the network? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Execution Config Manipulation] Can attackers exploit the public re-export of 'execution_config' at line 51 to disable paranoid hot potato verification or modify gas parameters, enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Storage Config Attack] Does the re-export of 'storage_config' at line 71 expose database pruning settings or buffer sizes that attackers could manipulate to cause state corruption or storage exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Mempool Manipulation] Can the public re-export of 'mempool_config' at line 59 allow external modification of transaction pool sizes or timeout values to facilitate transaction censorship or DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Declaration] [Missing Validation] Are critical security modules like 'dkg_config' (line 14) and 'jwk_consensus_config' (line 24) properly validated through the sanitizer, or are they loaded without security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [State Sync Attack] Can attackers manipulate the publicly exposed 'state_sync_config' at line 70 to force validators to sync from malicious peers or disable state verification, leading to state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [API Exposure] Does the public re-export of 'api_config' at line 45 allow modification of API endpoints or authentication settings that could expose internal validator data or enable unauthorized API access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Loading] [Failpoint Injection] Can the 'error' module (line 15) be exploited to inject custom error handling logic that bypasses failpoint validation, allowing attackers to enable failpoints on mainnet validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Logger Manipulation] Can the public re-export of 'logger_config' at line 58 be exploited to disable security-critical logging, modify log levels to hide malicious activity, or cause log injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [Indexer Config Attack] Do the re-exports of indexer configurations (lines 54-57) expose database credentials or indexer GRPC endpoints that could be exploited for data exfiltration or service disruption? (Medium)",
