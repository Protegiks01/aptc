  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Imports] [Dependency poisoning] The file imports aptos_gas_schedule_updator library - can a malicious version of this library be introduced through dependency confusion attacks during builds? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Logging & audit trail] Does the tool log all generated proposals and their parameters for audit purposes, or can malicious proposals be generated without leaving traces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error messages] Can error messages leak sensitive information about the system configuration or file paths that attackers could use for reconnaissance? (Low)",
