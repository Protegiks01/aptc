  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Enum: EntryFunctionCall] [Type Safety] Can an attacker exploit the lack of bounds checking on Vec<u8> fields (collection, name, description, uri) to inject arbitrarily large payloads causing memory exhaustion or DoS conditions during BCS deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_token_sdk_builder.rs] [Enum: EntryFunctionCall] [Input Validation] Do the property_keys, property_values, and property_types vectors in TokenCreateTokenScript enforce length matching, or can mismatched vectors lead to undefined behavior or state corruption when processed by the Move VM?
