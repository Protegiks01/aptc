  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Security Headers] Does the service automatically add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP), or are responses vulnerable to clickjacking and XSS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Missing Audit Logging] Is audit logging configured at the service level for all API calls, or must each component implement its own logging with potential gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Parameter: basic_api] [Health Check Bypass] Can attackers bypass the health check in BasicApi by accessing FundApi endpoints directly through the composed service without health validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Parameter: captcha_api] [CAPTCHA Bypass] If CaptchaApi is disabled, does the service composition still protect FundApi endpoints, or can attackers fund accounts without solving CAPTCHAs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Parameter: fund_api] [Privilege Escalation] Can the service composition be exploited to access FundApi's internal methods that should only be callable by other components? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Component Confusion] If multiple components define endpoints with similar names, can routing confusion allow attackers to call unintended endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Parameter: basic_api] [Semaphore Sharing] If BasicApi holds a concurrent request semaphore, is it shared properly with FundApi, or can attackers overload FundApi while BasicApi shows healthy? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Schema Injection] Can attackers manipulate the OpenAPI schema generation to inject malicious schema definitions that cause client-side vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Information Leakage] Does the auto-generated OpenAPI specification expose internal endpoint details, parameter constraints, or error messages that aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: server()] [Base URL Manipulation] Can attackers exploit the OpenAPI specification's server URL to redirect clients to malicious faucet clones for phishing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Method: trim()] [Whitespace Handling] Does calling .trim() on the version string prevent injection attacks if the version file contains leading/trailing malicious content, or could special characters still cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Constant: VERSION] [Buffer Overflow] If the .version file is extremely large, could include_str! cause compilation issues or runtime problems when passed to the OpenAPI service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Constant: VERSION] [Supply Chain] Can an attacker who compromises the build pipeline modify the doc/.version file to inject malicious version strings that are then included in the compiled binary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Constant: VERSION] [File System Access] Does the relative path '../../../doc/.version' create security risks during build if the build environment has been compromised? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Initialization Race] If this function is called multiple times concurrently, can race conditions cause inconsistent service states or allow bypassing security controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Resource Cleanup] If service construction fails partway through, are the API components properly cleaned up, or could resource leaks allow attackers to exhaust memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/api.rs] [Function: build_openapi_service()] [Shutdown Safety] When the service shuts down, are the three API components gracefully stopped to prevent incomplete transactions or corrupted state? (Medium)"
