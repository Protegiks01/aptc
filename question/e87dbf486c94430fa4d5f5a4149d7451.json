  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [All metrics] [Write access] If an attacker gains write access to the metrics backend, can they forge verification success metrics to hide backup corruption or incomplete verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [VERIFY_COORDINATOR_START_TS and FAIL_TS] [Timing attack] Can the time difference between START_TS and FAIL_TS be analyzed to determine which specific backup chunks or epochs cause verification failures, potentially identifying corrupted or malicious backup data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Integration] [Atomicity violation] Are metric updates atomic with the actual verification state changes, or could crashes between verification completion and metric updates leave inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [VERIFY_STATE_SNAPSHOT_LEAF_INDEX and TARGET_LEAF_INDEX] [Progress calculation] Can incorrect calculations of progress (current/target) due to concurrent updates or overflows mislead operators about verification completeness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [All metrics] [Observability gap] If metrics are silently failing to update due to backend issues, will verification continue without operators being aware that monitoring is broken? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Metric export] [Data leakage] When metrics are exported to external monitoring systems, could sensitive versioning or timing information be leaked to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Integration with restore controllers] [Verification bypass] Could a malicious restore controller manipulate metrics to show successful verification while skipping actual cryptographic verification of Merkle proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] If metric registration fails but is unwrapped, does the panic propagate correctly or could verification continue with broken monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Dependency] [Supply chain] Could a compromised aptos_push_metrics crate manipulate metric values or registration to hide verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/verify.rs] [Static lifetime] [Memory safety] Are there any unsafe operations or memory issues with the static Lazy initialization that could be exploited to corrupt metric values? (Low)"
