  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: account()] [Reference safety] Does the account() getter return a reference that could lead to use-after-free or dangling pointer issues if the CoinWithdraw struct is dropped while the reference is still in use? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Account validation] Does new() validate that the account parameter represents an existing account on-chain, or can callers create withdrawal events for non-existent accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Field: account] [Address collision] If AccountAddress uses a weak hashing scheme, can attackers generate colliding addresses that make withdrawal events appear to come from legitimate accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Does new() perform ANY validation on coin_type, account, or amount parameters, or does it blindly construct CoinWithdraw structs with potentially invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [String cloning] Does new() properly clone the coin_type String parameter, or can ownership/borrowing issues lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory allocation] Can calling new() with an extremely large coin_type String cause memory allocation failures or OOM conditions that crash the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Race condition] Is new() thread-safe when called concurrently by multiple threads, or can race conditions lead to partially initialized CoinWithdraw structs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization attack] Can the Serialize implementation produce non-canonical BCS output that validators serialize differently, causing state root divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Deserialization attack] Can the Deserialize implementation accept multiple valid BCS representations of the same CoinWithdraw data, enabling replay attacks or double-counting of withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] Can attackers craft events that claim to be from the 'coin' module but are actually from a different module, bypassing access controls that filter by module name? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name collision] Can multiple structs use STRUCT_NAME='CoinWithdraw', causing type confusion where withdrawal events are misinterpreted as other event types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Static: COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can the COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE Lazy static be modified or replaced after initialization, allowing attackers to change how CoinWithdraw events are typed and validated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Static: COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Race condition] Is the Lazy initialization of COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE thread-safe, or can concurrent first accesses cause multiple initializations leading to inconsistent type tags? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Static: COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Address verification] Does COIN_WITHDRAW_TYPE verify that CORE_CODE_ADDRESS is the correct address for the coin module, or can it be initialized with an attacker-controlled address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version] Does MoveEventV2Type implementation ensure backwards compatibility with V1 events, or can version confusion lead to withdrawal events being ignored or misprocessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep copy] Does Clone properly deep-copy the coin_type String, or can shallow copying lead to multiple CoinWithdraw instances sharing the same string buffer causing memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Hash collision] Can attackers craft two different CoinWithdraw events that compare equal due to hash collisions in the PartialEq implementation, enabling event deduplication bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: Eq] [Reflexivity] Does the Eq implementation maintain reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity invariants, or can violations lead to broken Set/Map operations on CoinWithdraw events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leak] Can the Debug implementation leak sensitive information (e.g., private keys in AccountAddress) through debug logs that are accessible to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Event ordering] Can CoinWithdraw events be emitted out-of-order relative to actual withdrawal transactions, causing indexers to show incorrect withdrawal histories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Missing timestamp] Does CoinWithdraw include a timestamp field, or can the lack of temporal information make it impossible to determine when withdrawals occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Missing transaction hash] Does CoinWithdraw link to its originating transaction, or can this make it impossible to verify the legitimacy of withdrawal events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Struct: CoinWithdraw] [Event replay across chains] Can CoinWithdraw events from one blockchain (e.g., testnet) be replayed on another chain (e.g., mainnet) if there's no chain ID validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Gas exhaustion] Can deserializing a maliciously crafted CoinWithdraw event consume excessive gas due to quadratic complexity in BCS parsing, enabling DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_withdraw.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas metering] Is gas properly metered when calling new(), or can attackers spam event creation to exhaust block gas limits without paying appropriate fees? (High)"
