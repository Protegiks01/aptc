  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Move VM: Module loading] [Module replacement attack] After compile_to_test_plan() generates bytecode, can an attacker replace modules in the TestPlan before execution to run different code than what was tested? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Version handling] [Compiler downgrade attack] Can an attacker force the use of an older, vulnerable compiler version by manipulating CompilerVersion::latest_stable() to exploit known compiler bugs? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Language features] [Feature flag abuse] Can tests enable unstable Move language features through LanguageVersion::latest_stable() that haven't been security-audited, introducing vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Error suppression] [Warning suppression attack] Does ignore_compile_warnings (line 79) allow tests with critical security warnings (e.g., integer overflow, type confusion) to execute, potentially hiding vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Optimization attacks] [Optimization-dependent bugs] Can compiler optimizations in move_compiler_v2 cause different behavior between debug and release builds, allowing security tests to pass in debug but fail in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [File I/O: Path validation] [Directory traversal] Can relative paths in source_files (e.g., '../../sensitive/file.move') escape the intended project directory and compile sensitive or malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [File I/O: Symbolic links] [Symlink attack] If source_files or dep_files contain symbolic links, can attackers bypass access controls to compile code from restricted directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [File I/O: Race conditions] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Can an attacker modify source files between compile_to_test_plan() calls (lines 177 and 179), causing different code to be compiled than what was intended for testing? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [File I/O: Writer safety] [Output tampering] Can the Writer parameter be a file descriptor that writes to a sensitive location (e.g., /var/log/secure), allowing test output to corrupt critical system files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Empty test plan] [False positive] If build_test_plan() returns a TestPlan with no tests due to filter exclusion, does run_and_report_unit_tests() return success (true), creating a false sense of security? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Zero threads] [Division by zero] If num_threads is set to 0, could this cause division by zero errors in TestRunner's thread pool initialization or work distribution logic? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Malicious module names] [Code injection via names] Can module names or test function names containing special characters (e.g., quotes, newlines) in format_module_id() cause injection attacks in output formatting? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Infinite test loops] [Resource exhaustion] Can tests contain infinite loops that never hit the gas limit due to gas metering bugs, causing the test suite to hang indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Recursive dependencies] [Stack overflow] If dep_files reference each other recursively, can this cause stack overflow during the compilation process in compile_to_test_plan()? (Medium)"
