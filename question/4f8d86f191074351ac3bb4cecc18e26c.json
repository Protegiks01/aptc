  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/schemes/fptx.rs] [Function: setup()] [Unimplemented vulnerability] The setup() function returns unimplemented!() - can an attacker trigger this function in production code to cause validator nodes to panic and crash, leading to loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/schemes/fptx.rs] [Function: setup()] [Protocol violation] Since setup() is unimplemented, how is production initialization handled, and can attackers exploit any initialization gaps to compromise the encryption scheme's security guarantees? (Critical)",
