  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Method: test_failed_transaction_cleanup()] [TraversalContext creation] The function creates a new TraversalStorage and TraversalContext - does this properly simulate production module traversal state, or could missing context cause bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Method: test_failed_transaction_cleanup()] [State view parameter] The function accepts any impl StateView - can tests pass in mock state views that don't enforce production invariants, causing cleanup logic to be inadequately tested? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Method: test_failed_transaction_cleanup()] [Return value tuple] The function returns (VMStatus, VMOutput) - are both values properly validated in tests, or could tests only check one value and miss issues with the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Method: test_failed_transaction_cleanup()] [Log context] The function uses state_view.id() with index 0 for logging - could this cause log pollution or confusion when multiple tests run concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Overall] [Test-production divergence] Does the testing infrastructure in this file accurately replicate production behavior, or are there subtle differences that could cause bugs to pass tests but fail in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Overall] [Error injection coverage] The file only supports injecting EndOfRunEpilogue errors - what about errors in transaction prologue, gas metering, module loading, or signature verification? Are critical error paths untested? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Overall] [Testing feature flag] Could the 'testing' feature flag be accidentally enabled in release builds through misconfigured cargo features, exposing test-only code in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Overall] [Concurrent test execution] If tests using error injection run concurrently, can thread-local state cause unpredictable interactions that hide race conditions in production code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Overall] [Test determinism] Can the error injection mechanism cause non-deterministic test results that lead to flaky tests, reducing confidence in the test suite? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Integration] [failed_transaction_cleanup call] The test function calls self.failed_transaction_cleanup() - if this production function changes its signature or behavior, will tests break or silently pass with incorrect behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Integration] [gas_feature_version dependency] The function calls self.gas_feature_version() - if gas feature versions are incorrectly configured in tests, could this cause production gas metering bugs to be missed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Integration] [runtime_environment dependency] The function calls self.runtime_environment() - does the test environment accurately reflect production runtime configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Integration] [Module storage] The function uses state_view.as_aptos_code_storage() - can test state views provide incomplete or incorrect module storage that doesn't match production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Rust] [RefCell panic] The RefCell in INJECTED_ERRORS could panic if borrow_mut() is called while the HashSet is already borrowed - can this happen in async test contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Rust] [cfg attribute interactions] The mix of #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'testing'))] and #[cfg(feature = 'testing')] could cause confusion - are all paths properly guarded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Rust] [Import visibility] The testing_only module is public - could external crates misuse this API if they enable the testing feature? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Documentation] [Missing docs] The file lacks documentation explaining when and how to use error injection - could developers misuse it causing inadequate test coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Documentation] [Usage examples] There are no examples of how test_failed_transaction_cleanup should be called - could incorrect usage in tests miss critical bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/testing.rs] [Maintenance] [Limited error types] With only one InjectedError variant, is this mechanism scalable as more error injection points are needed? (Low)"
