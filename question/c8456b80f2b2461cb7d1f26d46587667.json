  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Cursor Forgery] Can an attacker craft StateKeyWrapper cursors that skip validation and point to arbitrary state keys, enabling cross-account data leakage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::resources()] [Page Boundary] Can pagination boundaries cause resources to appear in multiple pages or be skipped entirely when state changes between paginated requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::modules()] [Module Page Confusion] Can module pagination return the same module multiple times across pages due to cursor manipulation or state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account_resources()] [Limit Bypass] Can determine_limit be bypassed by supplying edge case values (0, 1, u16::MAX) that circumvent max page size restrictions? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::new()] [Version Time-of-Check] Can ledger version validation in get_latest_ledger_info_and_verify_lookup_version be bypassed through TOCTOU attacks where state advances between validation and usage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Historical State Poison] Can requesting very old ledger versions cause the API to load corrupted or tampered historical state that was previously pruned incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [Version Inconsistency] If different resources are read at different effective versions due to race conditions, can balance calculations mix state from incompatible ledger versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::resources()] [Version Drift] Can concurrent API requests with no specified version observe state from different ledger versions, breaking client assumptions about state consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::get_account_resource()] [StateKey Collision] Can StateKey::resource_typed generate colliding keys for different accounts due to hash weaknesses or encoding issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [StateKey Manipulation] Can StateKey::resource construction with attacker-controlled struct_tags access resources from different accounts or system tables? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [Resource Group Key] Can StateKey::resource_group be exploited to access resource groups from unintended accounts by manipulating the primary_fungible_store_address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::resources()] [Pagination Start Key] Can the start StateKey parameter bypass access control by pointing to state keys outside the target account's keyspace? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [Balance Addition Overflow] Can balance += operations overflow when summing coin_balance, fa_store_resource.balance(), and concurrent_fa_balance_resource.balance()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::resources()] [Limit Multiplication] Can determine_limit * resource_size calculations overflow when processing accounts with maximum resources and maximum page sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::modules()] [Module Size Accumulation] Can summing module bytecode sizes overflow u64 when an account has many large modules, causing incorrect memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Spawn Blocking Race] Can api_spawn_blocking cause race conditions when multiple threads access the same Account instance concurrently, leading to use-after-free or data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [Feature Flag TOCTOU] Can feature_enabled(DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_RESOURCE) check be exploited through TOCTOU where the feature flag changes between check and usage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [Concurrent State Reads] Can reading CoinStore and FungibleStore resources at slightly different times cause balance inconsistencies due to concurrent state updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::resources()] [Iterator Race] Can state_view iteration race with background state updates, causing resources to be skipped or duplicated in paginated results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [Error Code Manipulation] Can BasicErrorWith404::internal_with_code with AptosErrorCode::InternalError be exploited to mask actual error types or cause incorrect error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::balance()] [Silent Failures] Can balance calculation errors be silently ignored, causing zero balances to be returned even when errors occur during resource lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::find_event_key()] [Context Loss] Can .context() error wrapping lose critical error information needed for security logging or incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::find_resource()] [Resource Not Found Timing] Can resource_not_found error responses reveal timing information about whether resources exist, aiding account enumeration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accounts.rs] [Function: Account::account()] [BCS/JSON Divergence] Can differences in BCS vs JSON serialization cause the same AccountData to have different semantic meanings, confusing clients or breaking protocol assumptions? (Medium)"
