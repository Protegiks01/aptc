  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Unwrap Panic Chain] The function chains multiple .unwrap() calls - can any of these fail in production scenarios, causing the entire proposal generation process to panic and abort? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: append_script_hash()] [File Write Unwrap] Uses .unwrap() after file operations - can filesystem errors (permissions, disk full) cause panics that leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Framework] [Nested Unwrap] The framework::generate_upgrade_proposals() result is unwrapped - can framework generation failures cause unhandled panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: load_config()] [Path Unwrap] Uses .to_str().unwrap() on path - can non-UTF8 paths cause panics when loading configs, breaking governance proposal generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - RawScript] [File Name Unwrap] Uses .file_name().and_then().ok_or_else() but still has potential panics - can malformed script paths cause proposal generation to fail unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleLocator] [Deserialization Ambiguity] The visitor tries URL parsing before falling back to LocalFile - can this cause ambiguous cases where a local file path is mistaken for a URL or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ReleaseEntry] [Enum Serialization] Can an attacker craft malicious YAML that deserializes to unexpected ReleaseEntry variants, bypassing type-specific validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ProposalMetadata] [Serde Default Injection] Uses #[serde(default)] for URLs - can missing fields in malicious configs cause unexpected default values to be silently substituted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_config()] [Generic Deserialization] The generic OnChainConfig deserialization - can type confusion attacks exploit this to deserialize configs as wrong types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ReleaseConfig] [Clone Implementation] All structs derive Clone - can deep cloning of large configs cause memory exhaustion or performance issues that enable DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_and_equals()] [Comparison Logic] Uses PartialEq for config comparison - can floating point imprecision, NaN values, or custom PartialEq implementations cause incorrect equality checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Gas] [Gas Comparison Short-Circuit] If old == new, the gas proposal is skipped - can an attacker exploit this by making old and new equal through manipulation while actual gas costs differ? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Version] [Version Skip Logic] If fetch_and_equals returns true, version upgrade is skipped - can stale cached values cause legitimate upgrades to be incorrectly skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - Consensus] [Consensus Skip Logic] Similar skip logic for consensus config - can this cause critical consensus updates to be silently dropped if validation is bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: validate_upgrade()] [Partial Validation] Some ReleaseEntry types (Framework, RawScript) have empty validation - can malicious entries of these types bypass all validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_proposal_scripts()] [String Allocation] Extensive string and Vec allocations throughout - can an attacker craft configs that cause excessive memory allocation leading to OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: load_config()] [File Read to String] Reads entire file into String without size limit - can extremely large config files cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Temporary File Cleanup] TempPath is used but unclear if cleanup happens on panic - can panics leak temporary files and exhaust disk space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - RawScript] [HashMap Allocation] Creates HashMap for template data - can malicious scripts with many template variables cause excessive HashMap allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: ReleaseConfig] [Vec Growth] proposals and update_sequence are unbounded Vecs - can configs with thousands of entries cause performance degradation or memory issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Hash Algorithm Security] The execution hash is computed by GenerateExecutionHash - is the underlying hash algorithm collision-resistant and secure against pre-image attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: append_script_hash()] [Hash Comment Injection] The hash is added as a Move comment - can special characters or control sequences in the hash be exploited to inject malicious code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: generate_release_script() - RawScript] [Hash Vector Construction] Constructs 'vector[Xu8,Yu8,...]' from hash bytes - can endianness issues or byte ordering cause hash validation to fail on different architectures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: HashValue] [Hash Size Assumption] Code assumes standard hash size - can changes to hash algorithm or custom implementations break hash handling logic? (Medium)",
