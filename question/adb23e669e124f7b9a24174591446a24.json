  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Network partition] Is there a metric detecting network partition scenarios in JWK consensus, or can split-brain conditions go undetected until causing consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Message drops] Is there a counter for dropped JWK consensus messages due to channel overflow, or is message loss invisible to operators until consensus fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Epoch transitions] Is there a counter tracking JWK consensus state across epoch transitions, or can epoch boundary bugs go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Validator participation] Is there a gauge tracking which validators are actively participating in JWK consensus, or can Byzantine validators selectively drop out without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Integration] [Metric export security] Are these Prometheus metrics exposed on authenticated endpoints only, or can external attackers scrape PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES and OBSERVATION_SECONDS to gain intelligence about validator state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Integration] [Cross-component confusion] Can metrics from the JWK consensus subsystem be confused with metrics from other consensus subsystems (e.g., DKG consensus which has similar counter names), hiding security issues? (Low)"
