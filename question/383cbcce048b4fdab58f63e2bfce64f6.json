  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the IpRangeManagerConfig file path to read arbitrary files on the filesystem through path traversal attacks (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd'), potentially leaking sensitive configuration or bypassing blocklist restrictions by loading an empty file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Symlink Attack] If the blocklist file path points to a symlink, can an attacker with filesystem access replace it with a symlink to /dev/null or an empty file, effectively disabling IP blocking and allowing unlimited faucet funds drainage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Race Condition TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-to-time-of-use vulnerability where the blocklist file could be modified between IpRangeManager initialization and when check() is called, allowing previously blocked IPs to bypass restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted blocklist file with millions of IP ranges that consumes excessive memory during IpRangeManager initialization, causing OOM crashes and faucet service denial? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Malformed Input] Does the IpRangeManager::new() properly handle malformed IP range entries (e.g., '999.999.999.999/99', 'gggg::/999') without panicking or entering invalid states that could bypass blocklist checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Propagation] If IpRangeManager::new() returns an error due to file parsing failure, does the system fail closed (reject all requests) or fail open (allow all requests), and could this be exploited to bypass IP blocking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker inject special file paths like '/dev/random' or named pipes that cause IpRangeManager to block indefinitely during initialization, creating a permanent DoS condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Unicode/UTF-8 Attack] Does the file parser properly handle Unicode characters, BOM markers, or mixed encodings in the blocklist file that could cause parsing errors or bypass certain IP ranges? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Leak] If IpRangeManager::new() fails partway through parsing a large file, are all allocated resources properly cleaned up, or could repeated initialization failures lead to memory leaks and eventual faucet service crash? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Hot Reload Missing] Since IpBlocklistChecker is initialized once at startup, if administrators update the blocklist file, will changes take effect without restart, or can attackers continue using newly-blocked IPs until manual restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Bypass] In the IPv4 matching path, can an attacker send requests with IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (::ffff:192.0.2.1) that bypass the IPv4 blocklist check by entering the IPv6 code path instead, allowing blocked IPs to drain faucet funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Range Edge Case] Does the IPv4 range matching correctly handle boundary conditions like the first IP (x.x.x.0) and last IP (x.x.x.255) of a subnet, or can attackers use these edge addresses to bypass blocklist ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Broadcast Address] Are IPv4 broadcast addresses (255.255.255.255, subnet broadcasts) properly handled in the contains() check, or could they bypass detection due to special address handling in the iprange library? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Loopback] If 127.0.0.0/8 is in the blocklist, can an attacker bypass it by using specific loopback IPs like 127.0.0.2 or 127.255.255.255 that might not be caught by range matching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Private Range Bypass] Can attackers exploit RFC1918 private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) behind NAT to repeatedly request funds if these ranges aren't blocklisted, appearing as different public IPs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Subnet Mask Error] If the blocklist contains overlapping IPv4 ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.1.0.0/16), does the ipv4_list.contains() correctly match all IPs in both ranges, or could specific IPs fall through the cracks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Zero Address] Does the check properly handle 0.0.0.0 as a source IP, or could this special address bypass blocklist validation and allow unlimited faucet requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Class E Range] Are experimental IPv4 addresses (240.0.0.0/4, Class E) properly validated and blocked if in the blocklist, or do they receive special treatment that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Link-Local] Can attackers use link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16) to bypass blocklist checks if the faucet accepts requests from these special-use addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv4 Performance DoS] If an attacker sends millions of requests from different IPv4 addresses, does the ipv4_list.contains() operation remain O(log n) efficient, or could it degrade to O(n) causing CPU exhaustion and faucet slowdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Notation Bypass] Can an attacker use compressed IPv6 notation (e.g., ::1 vs 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1) or mixed notation (::ffff:192.0.2.1) that gets normalized differently, bypassing blocklist entries that use a different notation format? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Privacy Extensions] With IPv6 privacy extensions (RFC 4941) rotating addresses, can an attacker from a single host generate unlimited temporary IPv6 addresses to bypass per-IP rate limiting and drain faucet funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 /64 Subnet] Since most IPv6 allocations give /64 subnets with 2^64 addresses, does the blocklist properly handle /64 ranges, or do administrators need to block individual IPs allowing trivial bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Zone ID] Does the IPv6 parsing strip zone identifiers (fe80::1%eth0) before checking against the blocklist, or could attackers add arbitrary zone IDs to bypass exact-match blocklist entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Transition Mechanisms] Can attackers use 6to4 (2002::/16), Teredo (2001::/32), or 6rd tunneling addresses that might not be properly handled by ipv6_list.contains() to bypass blocklist restrictions?
