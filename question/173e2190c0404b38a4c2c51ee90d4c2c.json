  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] Does the tokio::main async runtime properly handle panics that occur during args.run().await execution, or could an unhandled panic in the transaction generator crash the process without cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] The main function returns Result<()> with ? operator - are all errors from args.run() properly propagated and logged, or could critical failures be silently swallowed leading to incorrect transaction generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Stack overflow] Could deeply nested async operations in args.run() cause stack overflow in the tokio runtime, especially when processing large transaction batches or recursive Move script execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the tokio runtime have any limits on the number of concurrent tasks spawned by args.run(), or could unbounded task spawning during transaction generation lead to memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input injection] Can malicious command line arguments passed to IndexerCliArgs::parse() contain path traversal sequences (../) that could allow reading/writing files outside intended directories when processing testing_folder or output_folder? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Buffer overflow] Could excessively long command line arguments (testing_folder, output_folder, network) cause buffer overflow or memory exhaustion during clap parsing before reaching args.run()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode exploitation] Does IndexerCliArgs::parse() properly validate Unicode characters in path arguments, or could homoglyph attacks or special Unicode sequences bypass file system security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Symbolic link attack] If command line arguments contain symbolic links in testing_folder or output_folder paths, could an attacker trick the tool into reading/writing sensitive files by manipulating symlinks after parse but before run()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Argument injection] Could shell metacharacters or special sequences in command line arguments be improperly handled by clap, potentially leading to command injection if arguments are later used in shell commands within args.run()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integer overflow] If network or mode arguments contain extremely large string values, could this cause integer overflow during parsing or when indexing into collections in subsequent processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Cancellation safety] Is the args.run().await call cancellation-safe, or could untimely cancellation (SIGINT, SIGTERM) during transaction generation leave partially written files or corrupted state in the output directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Tokio worker threads] Does the #[tokio::main] macro use appropriate worker thread configuration, or could CPU-bound operations in args.run() block all worker threads preventing other async tasks from progressing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal handling] Are SIGTERM/SIGINT signals properly handled during args.run() execution to allow graceful shutdown, or could forced termination corrupt generated transaction files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async recursion] If args.run() triggers recursive async calls (e.g., nested transaction processing), could this exhaust the tokio task queue or cause deadlocks in the async runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory leak] Could the async runtime created by #[tokio::main] fail to properly clean up memory after args.run() completes, especially if there are circular references in spawned tasks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Use-after-free] If args.run() spawns background tasks that outlive the function return, could these tasks access freed memory after main() exits, causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege escalation] If this tool is run with elevated privileges (sudo), are there safeguards to prevent args.run() from creating files with overly permissive permissions that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment variable injection] Does IndexerCliArgs::parse() or args.run() read any environment variables that could be manipulated by an attacker to change tool behavior or inject malicious configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Working directory] Could changing the current working directory before running this tool cause unexpected behavior in path resolution within args.run(), potentially leading to file operations on unintended directories?
