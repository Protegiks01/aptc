(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Enum: ErrorCode] [False error reporting] Can Byzantine validators send ErrorCode messages claiming parsing failures for valid messages, confusing peer validators about message validity and disrupting consensus? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Function: MultiplexMessageSink::start_send()] [Serialization timing] Can timing differences in BCS serialization be exploited to infer message contents, enabling side-channel attacks on consensus messages containing sensitive data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Function: MultiplexMessageStream::poll_next()] [Poll frequency] Can repeated polling without yielding control (busy-wait) when Poll::Pending is returned cause excessive CPU usage and starve other validator tasks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Struct: RpcRequest] [Request amplification] Can a single malicious RpcRequest trigger multiple RpcResponse messages from different validators, creating an amplification vector for network resource exhaustion? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Function: MultiplexMessageStream::poll_next()] [No message authentication] The deserialization at line 231 doesn't verify message authenticity - are messages authenticated at a higher layer, or can man-in-the-middle attackers inject forged messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Struct: RpcResponse] [Response forgery] Since responses lack cryptographic signatures at this layer, can compromised network nodes forge responses to redirect validators or manipulate consensus outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Enum: MultiplexMessage] [Stream hijacking] Can an attacker send StreamMessage fragments with request_ids matching active streams to inject data into ongoing stream transfers and corrupt large message reassembly?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Enum: MultiplexMessage] [Message type switching] Can an attacker start a stream with StreamMessage::Header then switch to sending regular NetworkMessage with the same connection, causing stream state machine confusion?
