  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [SmallVec optimization] The SmallVec return type - can stack-allocated optimization lead to buffer overflows if multiple values are somehow returned instead of the expected single value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Move bytecode validation] Does the bytecode verifier ensure borrow_address is only called on proper signer values from transaction senders, or can it be invoked on signers from other sources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Reference counting] If SignerRef uses reference counting, can integer overflows in the ref count allow double-free or use-after-free when multiple borrow_address calls occur? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Memory leak] Can repeated calls to borrow_address without proper cleanup cause memory leaks in long-running transactions with many signer operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Dangling reference] After borrow_signer() returns a reference, can the underlying signer be moved or dropped, leaving callers with a dangling pointer to freed memory? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Transaction signer validation] Can borrow_address be called on signers from aborted or failed transactions, potentially leaking addresses from invalid transaction contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Multi-sig transactions] In transactions with multiple signers, can borrow_address be exploited to access the wrong signer's address, breaking access control assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Signer uniqueness] Can the same signer reference be borrowed multiple times in one transaction to create multiple address references, and could this violate Move's resource uniqueness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Transaction replay] If a transaction is replayed with the same signer, does borrow_address return identical references, and could this enable replay attacks if reference identity is used for authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Gas parameter manipulation] Can governance proposals maliciously set SIGNER_BORROW_ADDRESS_BASE to zero, allowing free signer operations and enabling spam attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/signer.rs] [Function: native_borrow_address()] [Gas schedule updates] During epoch transitions when gas schedules change, can transactions in-flight use old or new gas prices inconsistently, causing state divergence between validators? (High)",
