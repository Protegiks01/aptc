  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [BigQuery Injection] Can the `event_name` field contain BigQuery-specific injection payloads or special characters that modify query semantics when data is queried from the analytics database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Schema Poisoning] Can malicious `event_name` values cause schema inference issues in BigQuery, potentially corrupting the table schema or causing query failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Timestamp Precision] Does the `event_timestamp: u64` field properly represent microsecond precision after conversion from Duration, or can precision loss cause event ordering issues in time-series analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Timestamp Overflow] Can epoch transitions or far-future timestamps cause the u64 `event_timestamp` to overflow, resulting in incorrect time values stored in BigQuery? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Event Params Type Confusion] Does the `event_params: Vec<serde_json::Value>` allow arbitrary JSON types (arrays, objects, null) that could cause type confusion or parsing errors in BigQuery schema? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Flatten Injection] Does the `#[serde(flatten)]` attribute on `event_identity` properly prevent key collisions, or can an attacker craft EventIdentity with keys that overwrite other BigQueryRow fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Serialization Inconsistency] Can differences in JSON serialization between Rust serde and BigQuery's parser cause data corruption or loss of information during ingestion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [PeerId Leakage] Does the flattened `event_identity` containing PeerId expose sensitive validator identity information that could enable targeted attacks on specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [ChainId Confusion] Can an attacker submit telemetry with mismatched ChainId values in EventIdentity, causing cross-chain metric pollution or incorrect network analytics? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Circular Reference] If TelemetryEvent or TelemetryDump contained self-referential structures (though they don't currently), could serialization cause infinite loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Format String Injection] Can String fields in the structs contain format specifiers that cause injection vulnerabilities when serialized data is used in formatted output? (Low)",
