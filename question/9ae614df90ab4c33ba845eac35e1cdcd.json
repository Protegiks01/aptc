  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: Signature::LENGTH] [Signature Size Validation] Does code that uses SIGNATURE_LENGTH properly validate actual signature sizes, or can mismatches between expected and actual signature sizes cause buffer overflows when parsing signatures received over the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::from_bytes_unchecked()] [Error Mapping Loss] Does converting all errors to WrongLengthError at lines 78, 81, 84 hide important error details that could help diagnose attacks, such as distinguishing between truncated keys and corrupted keys?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: SigningKey::sign()] [Error Propagation] Does the `?` operator at line 143 properly propagate all possible errors from signing_message(), or are some error conditions silently ignored leading to signatures over unintended message content? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::clone()] [Unwrap Danger] Does the unwrap() at line 34 create a panic vector where attackers can craft keys that clone successfully once but fail on subsequent clones, causing non-deterministic validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: arbitrary::Arbitrary for PublicKey] [Error Mapping] Does mapping all errors to IncorrectFormat at line 48 hide important distinctions between different types of invalid keys, reducing fuzzing effectiveness at finding edge cases?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::from_bytes_unchecked()] [Weak Seed Domain] Does the function validate that the three 16-byte seeds don't come from a weak domain (e.g., printable ASCII characters), which would reduce the effective keyspace from 2^384 to a much smaller searchable space?
