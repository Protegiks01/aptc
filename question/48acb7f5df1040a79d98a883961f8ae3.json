  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_svg()] [Logic Error] The sort and take operations at lines 82-88 only operate on data[0] - can this cause inconsistencies if benchmarks have different sample sets, leading to incorrect joined mapping? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_benchmarks_to_file()] [String Injection] Can benchmark sample names contain special characters that break SVG rendering when used in Text elements at lines 178-179 and 206? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_benchmarks_to_file()] [XML Injection] When drawing labels with sample names and config strings, are these properly escaped for SVG/XML context to prevent markup injection that could break rendering? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_benchmarks_to_file()] [Error Suppression] Do the root.draw() calls at lines 194-226 properly propagate errors, or can rendering failures be silently ignored leading to incomplete/corrupted SVG output? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_benchmarks_to_file()] [Coordinate Overflow] At lines 184-188, can the Cartesian2d coordinate system setup fail or behave unexpectedly with extreme coordinate ranges causing rendering artifacts? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_svg()] [Validation Missing] The --top argument accepts any number parsed as usize - can extremely large values cause issues when data[0].take(*n) is called with values exceeding actual data length? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/plot.rs] [Function: plot_svg()] [Logic Error] When --sort is specified without data files, can accessing data[0] at line 83 cause a panic due to empty vector? (Low)",
