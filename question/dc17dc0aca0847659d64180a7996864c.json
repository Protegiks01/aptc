  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs] [Pruner Progress Inconsistency] Can different pruner progress values (Event, Transaction, TransactionInfo, etc.) being misaligned indicate database corruption or pruning bugs that could be exploited? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs lines 245-255] [Epoch Ending Signature Leak] Do the last 10 epoch endings expose complete validator signatures and quorum certificates that could be analyzed to identify Byzantine validators or voting patterns?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs] [EpochEndingStateMerkle Special Handling] Why is EpochEndingStateMerkle pruned separately, and could exploiting this separation enable epoch boundary attacks or state fork conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_db_versions.rs] [Metadata Item Limit] Does print_metadata_items() have any limit on the number of items printed, or could a database with millions of metadata entries cause output truncation or buffer overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Auxiliary Info State Root] Does PersistedAuxiliaryInfo contain state root hashes that could be compared across versions to detect state forks or consensus divergence? (High)",
