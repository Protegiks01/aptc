  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: are_failpoints_enabled()] [Feature Flag Inconsistency] Can validators be deployed with different failpoint feature flag settings, causing some nodes to execute different code paths and break consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: are_failpoints_enabled()] [Production Exposure] Is there proper validation to ensure failpoints are never enabled in production validator binaries, or can a misconfigured build accidentally enable debug features that expose attack surfaces? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: are_failpoints_enabled()] [Information Disclosure] Does the failpoints feature expose internal error paths or state information that attackers can use to understand system internals and craft targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: are_failpoints_enabled()] [Runtime Feature Toggle] Is this checked at compile-time only via cfg_if, or can runtime behavior differ based on dynamic conditions, potentially allowing feature flag manipulation during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [Type Name Spoofing] Can an attacker craft types with malicious names that, when extracted by type_name(), produce misleading config names causing wrong configs to be loaded (e.g., 'ConsensusConfig' vs 'Malicious::ConsensusConfig')? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [Unsafe Type Coercion] Does the ?Sized bound allow unsized types that could cause undefined behavior or panics when type_name() is called, potentially crashing validator nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [String Manipulation Attack] The split('::').last().unwrap_or() could panic on invalid UTF-8 or malformed type names - can this be exploited to crash nodes during config loading? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [Default Name Fallback] When split returns empty iterator, it defaults to 'UnknownConfig' - can this cause validators to silently load wrong configs or skip critical config validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [Namespace Collision] Can different types with the same final name component (e.g., 'consensus::Config' and 'network::Config' both returning 'Config') cause config files to overwrite each other or be loaded incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: get_config_name()] [Generic Type Confusion] For generic types like Config<T>, does type_name() include the type parameter in a predictable way, or can different instantiations produce the same name causing config conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: is_tokio_console_enabled()] [Debug Feature Exposure] If tokio-console is accidentally enabled in production, does it expose runtime performance data, task scheduling information, or internal state that attackers can monitor to time attacks or understand validator behavior? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: is_tokio_console_enabled()] [Performance Impact] Can enabling tokio-console cause significant performance degradation in validators, leading to missed consensus deadlines, timeout-based slashing, or network partition? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: is_tokio_console_enabled()] [Network Exposure] Does tokio-console open network ports for monitoring - can attackers connect to these ports on validator nodes to extract sensitive timing information or inject malicious commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Function: is_tokio_console_enabled()] [Feature Flag Mismatch] Can some validators run with tokio-console enabled while others don't, causing performance disparities that affect consensus timing and leader election fairness? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Struct: RootPath] [No Path Validation] The RootPath struct stores paths without validating they exist, are directories, or have proper permissions - can this cause validators to fail at runtime with unclear errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Struct: RootPath] [Missing Canonicalization] Paths are stored as-is without canonicalization - can symbolic links, '.', '..', or hardlinks cause the same logical path to have multiple representations breaking config caching or equality checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Struct: RootPath] [Concurrent Modification] The root_path field can be read via full_path() without synchronization - in multi-threaded validator code, can this cause data races or torn reads of PathBuf? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Struct: RootPath] [No Access Control Checks] RootPath doesn't verify that the process has read/execute permissions on the path - can this cause runtime failures when validators try to load configs from inaccessible directories? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Struct: RootPath] [Platform-Specific Behavior] Does RootPath behave identically on Linux/Windows/macOS with their different path semantics, or can cross-platform differences cause validators on different OS to diverge? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Config Loading] When RootPath is used to load consensus configs, can an attacker exploit path traversal to load a malicious consensus_config.yaml that sets unsafe parameters like reduced voting thresholds or disabled signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Validator Keys] If RootPath is used to locate validator private keys, can path traversal allow an attacker to point the validator to attacker-controlled key files, enabling them to impersonate validators and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Network Config] Can exploiting full_path() path handling allow loading network configs from attacker-controlled locations, potentially setting malicious seed peers or disabling security features? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Genesis Config] During validator initialization, can path vulnerabilities in RootPath cause loading of a malicious genesis.blob that sets up an attacker-controlled validator set or invalid initial state? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Storage Config] Can path traversal in RootPath configuration allow redirecting AptosDB storage to attacker-controlled locations where they can corrupt state or inject invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/utils.rs] [Integration: Safety Rules] If safety_rules configuration uses RootPath, can attackers manipulate paths to load permissive safety rules that allow double-signing or equivocation? (Critical)"
