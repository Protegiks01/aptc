  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Gas parameter manipulation] Can onchain_config gas parameters be set to extreme values (e.g., zero gas costs or infinite gas limits) that break economic security assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Config version skew] Can different executor shards receive different versions of onchain_config, causing them to execute the same transactions with different rules and produce divergent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Config caching] If onchain_config is cached incorrectly, can stale configuration be used for execution even after on-chain upgrades, causing violations of new protocol rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [VMStatus forging] Can a Byzantine shard return fabricated VMStatus errors to incorrectly mark valid transactions as failed, causing them to be dropped and potentially allowing double-spend attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Error code mapping] Can VMStatus error codes be manipulated to map retriable errors to fatal errors or vice versa, causing incorrect error handling in the consensus layer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Partial failure handling] If some sub-blocks succeed and others return VMStatus errors, how is this handled during result aggregation, and can inconsistent handling cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVRequest] [Access control bypass] Can RemoteKVRequest include StateKeys for system-reserved addresses or modules that should not be accessible during remote execution, bypassing access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVRequest] [Key collision] Can attackers craft StateKeys that collide with legitimate keys due to hash collisions or encoding ambiguities, allowing them to read or poison wrong state values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVRequest] [Historical state access] Can StateKeys be crafted to access historical state versions that should be pruned or inaccessible, potentially revealing sensitive past state or causing time-travel attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVResponse] [Merkle proof omission] Does RemoteKVResponse include cryptographic proofs (e.g., Merkle proofs) for the returned state values, or can values be returned without proof, allowing Byzantine coordinators to serve arbitrary data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All structs] [Unsafe code interaction] While lib.rs has no unsafe blocks, can the data structures be passed to unsafe code in other modules where memory safety violations could occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [All structs] [Interior mutability] Do any of the contained types use interior mutability (Cell, RefCell, etc.) that could lead to race conditions when structs are shared across threads via Arc? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Vec types] [Capacity vs length attacks] Can attackers craft Vec instances with large capacity but small length, wasting memory and potentially causing allocation failures in resource-constrained environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Module imports] [Dependency confusion] Can version skew between aptos_types, aptos_vm, and executor-service cause incompatible type definitions that break serialization or execution logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Public API] [Breaking changes] If the struct definitions change in backward-incompatible ways, can old and new nodes coexist in the network, or will this cause immediate network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Module structure] [Circular dependencies] Do the module declarations create any circular dependency risks that could lead to initialization order issues or deadlocks during service startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Analysis bypass] Can pre-computed AnalyzedTransaction metadata be incorrect or stale, causing Block-STM to make wrong assumptions about transaction dependencies and miss conflicts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Read/write set forgery] Can AnalyzedTransaction read/write sets be manipulated to hide actual dependencies, allowing conflicting transactions to execute in parallel and create race conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand] [Storage location mismatch] Can AnalyzedTransaction metadata point to wrong storage locations (wrong shard, wrong state tree), causing transactions to read/write incorrect state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Aggregation order dependency] Does the order in which Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> from different shards are aggregated matter, and can manipulating this order cause different final state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Missing shard results] If a remote executor shard fails to return results, how is this handled, and can it cause the coordinator to proceed with partial results leading to incomplete execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteExecutionResult] [Duplicate results] Can the same shard send multiple RemoteExecutionResult messages for the same block, causing duplicate processing and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVRequest] [Batch size manipulation] While REMOTE_STATE_KEY_BATCH_SIZE is defined in remote_state_view.rs, can RemoteKVRequest bypass this limit by being crafted directly with oversized keys Vec? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [RemoteKVResponse] [Response fragmentation] Can large RemoteKVResponse messages be fragmented during network transmission in ways that allow reassembly attacks or message injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [ExecuteBlockCommand::into()] [Move semantics violation] Can calling into() on a cloned ExecuteBlockCommand lead to multiple ownership of the same sub_blocks data, causing use-after-free or double-free issues? (High)"
