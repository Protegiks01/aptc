  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_internal()] [Serialization error masking] If both single and Vec parsing fail, the function returns SerializationError with raw response - can this leak sensitive repository data in error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Content stripping vulnerability] The function strips newlines every 60 characters - can an attacker craft base64 content where this stripping corrupts validator keys or configuration in a way that appears valid but is compromised? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Base64 length manipulation] Since GitHub adds newlines every 60 chars, can an attacker exploit edge cases where legitimate base64 data is corrupted by the stripping logic, causing validators to load invalid keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Content encoding bypass] Does the function validate that content parameter is valid base64, or can attackers inject raw binary or malicious strings that get stored without validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Content size attack] Can an attacker upload extremely large base64-encoded files that cause memory exhaustion when the lines().collect() operation loads the entire content into memory on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_file()] [Newline injection] Can malicious content with injected newlines bypass the stripping logic to embed malicious data or commands within validator configuration files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: TIMEOUT] [Timeout integer overflow] The TIMEOUT constant is u64 = 10_000 - can this value overflow when converted to milliseconds internally, causing infinite timeouts that hang validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Timeout bypass] Does timeout_connect apply to the entire request lifecycle including response reading, or can attackers exploit slow HTTP response bodies to bypass the 10 second timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Connection reuse attack] Are HTTP connections properly closed after each request, or can connection pooling be exploited to maintain open connections that bypass timeout restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: TIMEOUT] [DoS via timeout] Is the 10-second timeout sufficient to prevent slowloris-style attacks where GitHub API deliberately delays responses to exhaust validator resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Proxy injection] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables or configuration to set a malicious proxy_url that intercepts all GitHub API traffic including validator credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Proxy parsing vulnerability] Does ureq::Proxy::new() properly validate the proxy_url format, or can specially crafted proxy URLs cause crashes, code execution, or credential leakage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [HTTPS downgrade via proxy] Can a malicious proxy configuration downgrade HTTPS to HTTP, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks on validator configuration updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Proxy bypass] Does the proxy configuration properly handle all GitHub API endpoints including api.github.com, or can attackers bypass proxy restrictions to make unauthorized requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: upgrade_request()] [Host extraction exploit] The expect() on request.get_host() will panic if host is None - can this be triggered to crash validator nodes processing malformed GitHub API requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Infinite recursion DoS] Can an attacker create a deeply nested directory structure or circular symlinks that cause stack overflow when recursively deleting, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker create a directory with millions of files that cause the recursive deletion to consume excessive API quota or processing time, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Partial deletion state] If deletion fails midway through a recursive delete, can validators be left in an inconsistent state with partially deleted configuration that breaks consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_directory()] [Directory size DoS] Can an attacker fill a directory with millions of files causing get_directory() to return enormous Vec<String> that exhausts validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete_directory()] [Trailing slash handling] The function uses trim_end_matches('/') - can inconsistent handling of paths with/without trailing slashes cause deletion of wrong directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: post_url()] [Owner/repository injection] Are the owner and repository fields validated to prevent path traversal or special characters that could manipulate the GitHub API URL? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_url()] [Query parameter injection] Can the branch field contain special characters like '&' or '?' that inject additional query parameters to manipulate API responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Constant: URL] [Hardcoded endpoint vulnerability] The hardcoded 'https://api.github.com' URL cannot be changed - can this prevent validators from using GitHub Enterprise or alternative git hosting, forcing reliance on public GitHub? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: post_url()] [URL encoding bypass] Are path components properly URL-encoded when constructing API endpoints, or can unencoded special characters cause API request failures or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-github-client/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_url()] [Branch name validation] Can branch names with special characters like '../' or null bytes exploit URL construction to access unauthorized refs or tags? (High)"
