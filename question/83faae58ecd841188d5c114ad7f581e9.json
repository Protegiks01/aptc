  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker pass an extremely large array of SignedTransaction references causing unbounded memory allocation in the Vec::new() initialization, leading to OOM and faucet service DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Double ownership inefficiency] Does the double .to_owned().to_owned() pattern at line 12 create unnecessary memory copies that could be exploited to exhaust memory with crafted transaction batches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Hash collision] Can an attacker craft multiple different SignedTransactions that produce identical committed_hash() values, causing transaction confusion or replay attacks when hashes are used for deduplication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Empty array handling] Does the function properly handle an empty transactions array, or could passing &[] cause unexpected behavior in downstream rate limiting or logging logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Malformed transaction handling] If a SignedTransaction contains invalid or corrupted data, can the committed_hash() call panic or produce inconsistent results across different nodes? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Vec allocation] Is there a risk of Vec reallocation thrashing if the number of transactions varies wildly, causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: transaction_hashes()] [Type confusion] Could the committed_hash() method return different hash types or formats depending on transaction structure, leading to inconsistent string representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Panic on time error] Does the .expect() call at line 22 cause a panic when SystemTime::now() returns an error, leading to complete faucet service crash and loss of availability? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Time going backwards] Can system clock adjustments (NTP corrections, manual changes) cause duration_since() to fail, triggering the panic and crashing the faucet service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Clock manipulation attack] If an attacker gains control of the server's system clock via NTP spoofing or privilege escalation, can they manipulate rate limits by setting time backwards/forwards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Integer overflow] Can the as_secs() conversion overflow if the duration exceeds u64::MAX seconds (584 billion years), though practically impossible, is this handled safely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Monotonic clock] Should this use a monotonic clock instead of wall clock to prevent issues with DST transitions, leap seconds, and NTP adjustments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Race condition with time checks] Can concurrent calls to this function return slightly different values, causing race conditions in rate limit checks across multiple threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/helpers.rs] [Function: get_current_time_secs()] [Leap second handling] Does the function properly handle leap seconds that could cause duration_since to return unexpected values or fail? (Low)",
