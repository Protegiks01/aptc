  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Panic safety] If invalid credentials are provided, could this cause panics in downstream code that doesn't properly validate the config, leading to service disruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Privilege escalation] If an attacker gains access to modify this configuration, could they redirect NFT asset uploads to their own Cloudflare account, enabling content hijacking or phishing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Supply chain attack] If the configuration loading mechanism is compromised, could an attacker inject malicious Cloudflare credentials that upload assets to attacker-controlled infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Resource exhaustion] Could malicious configuration values (e.g., very long strings) cause resource exhaustion in the NFT metadata crawler, leading to denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Memory leak] Does the Clone implementation properly handle credential strings, or could cloning without proper cleanup lead to credential data persisting in memory longer than necessary? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Drop implementation] Is there a custom Drop implementation to securely zeroize credential strings when the config is dropped, preventing credentials from remaining in freed memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Field types] [String vulnerabilities] Are the String types susceptible to interior mutability exploits or unsafe operations that could corrupt or leak credential data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Configuration source] Is the source of this configuration trusted and authenticated, or could an attacker with file system access replace the config file to inject their own Cloudflare credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Environment separation] Are production and development configurations properly separated to prevent test/development Cloudflare credentials from being used in production, or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [API abuse] If the Cloudflare credentials are compromised, are there rate limits or usage monitoring to detect abnormal API usage patterns that could indicate credential theft? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/worker/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderWorkerConfig] [Quota exhaustion] Could an attacker with access to the configuration credentials exhaust the Cloudflare account's storage or bandwidth quotas, causing service disruption? (Medium)"
