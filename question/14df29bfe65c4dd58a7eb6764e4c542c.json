  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Constants: LATEST_STABLE_*_VERSION] [String conversion] Are the string constants LATEST_STABLE_LANGUAGE_VERSION and LATEST_STABLE_COMPILER_VERSION guaranteed to parse back to their value counterparts? Could they diverge? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Module: lang_feature_versions] [Feature availability] If COMPILE_FOR_TESTING_VALUE is V2_2 but a node compiles with V2_1, could testing-only code be inadvertently deployed to production? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Constant: SINT_LANGUAGE_VERSION_VALUE] [Type safety] Does code properly check is_at_least(SINT_LANGUAGE_VERSION_VALUE) before allowing signed integer usage? Could signed integers be used in V2_2, causing type safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Constant: LANGUAGE_VERSION_FOR_PUBLIC_STRUCT] [Access control] Does the check for public structs properly prevent their use in older versions? Could bytecode manipulated to include public structs execute in V2_3? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Constant: LANGUAGE_VERSION_FOR_RAC] [Feature bypass] What is RAC (Runtime Arithmetic Checks) gated by V2_5? Could attackers compile with V2_4 to bypass these safety checks while claiming V2_5 compatibility? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Dependency: legacy_move_compiler] [Compiler version mapping] Could mismatches between CompilerVersion and CompilerLanguageVersion cause incorrect compiler selection or compilation failures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Dependency: move_command_line_common::env] [Environment manipulation] Does get_bytecode_version_from_env() properly validate environment variables, or could injection attacks manipulate bytecode versioning? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Validator divergence] If validators run different versions of this file with different LATEST_STABLE values, could they disagree on whether bytecode is valid for production, causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Bytecode verification] Does the VM verify CompilationMetadata when loading bytecode? Could attackers deploy bytecode claiming stable versions while actually compiled with unstable features? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Upgrade coordination] During protocol upgrades that change LATEST_STABLE versions, could race conditions allow unstable bytecode to be deployed before all validators upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Historical compatibility] Can validators running old code validate new CompilationMetadata with future version numbers? Could forward compatibility issues cause consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: CompilerVersion::from_str()] [DoS via parsing] Could repeatedly parsing malformed version strings consume excessive CPU, allowing DoS attacks during bytecode verification? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: LanguageVersion::from_str()] [Regex complexity] Does from_str() use efficient string matching, or could crafted inputs cause catastrophic backtracking or excessive allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Overall] [Memory exhaustion] Could malicious metadata with extremely long version strings cause memory exhaustion during deserialization or validation? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/metadata.rs] [Function: CompilerVersion::from_str()] [Null bytes] Can null bytes in version strings cause truncation or parsing errors that differ between string processing methods? (Medium)",
