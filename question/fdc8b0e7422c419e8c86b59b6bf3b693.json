  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/pipeline.rs] [Atomic Operations] [Memory Ordering] At line 340, does Ordering::SeqCst provide sufficient guarantees, or could weaker orderings cause the AtomicBool update to be reordered with prior operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/pipeline.rs] [Atomic Operations] [Counter Visibility] At lines 78 (AtomicU64) and 78 (AtomicBool), are reads of these atomics properly synchronized with writes, or can stale values be observed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/pipeline.rs] [Atomic Operations] [Mixed Synchronization] Does mixing Arc<Mutex> for staged_result with AtomicBool/AtomicU64 for indexer_wrapper create memory ordering issues? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/pipeline.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Transaction Blocks] At line 227, are empty blocks (block_size == 0) properly validated as legitimate stage terminators, or can they be injected to DOS the pipeline? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/pipeline.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Start Version] At line 74, if start_version is 0, does this cause underflow at line 338 (target_ver - 1)? (High)",
