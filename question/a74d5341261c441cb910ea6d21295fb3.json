  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Selective forwarding] Can Byzantine validators selectively verify and forward only messages that benefit them while dropping others, causing honest validators to have inconsistent views of shares and aug data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Fast path poisoning] At lines 157-163, if fast_config is Some but FastShare::new() or S::generate() with fast_config produces shares incompatible with the slow path, can validators disagree on whether to use fast or slow randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Config inconsistency] If different validators have different fast_config settings (Some vs None, or different parameters), can they produce divergent randomness values even when processing the same shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start() - FastShare handling] [Path downgrade attack] If an attacker prevents fast path shares from reaching honest validators but slow path shares arrive, can they force a downgrade to slower randomness generation and delay consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Fast path race] If fast_share is added to rand_store after slow_share at lines 160-162, can there be a race where shares are aggregated using slow path before fast shares arrive, causing inconsistent path selection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Database corruption] The db parameter at line 81 is passed to AugDataStore - if the storage backend is corrupted or returns stale data, can this cause validators to load incorrect aug data and produce invalid randomness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Storage failure atomicity] At line 312, if add_aug_data() succeeds locally but the broadcast fails, and then the validator restarts, will get_my_aug_data() return the stored data and skip broadcasting, causing the validator to never certify their aug data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: aug_data_store] [Persistence verification] Is there verification that aug_data_store persists data durably to disk before considering it committed, or can a crash lose aug data and force restart from scratch? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_blocks()] [Round overflow] At line 133, rounds are collected as u64 - if a malicious block contains u64::MAX round number, can this cause overflow in arithmetic operations or comparisons in downstream components? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_aggregate_shares_task()] [Duration overflow] At line 274, if the sleep duration 300ms is somehow modified or misconfigured to extremely large values, can this cause aggregation to never begin and randomness to stall? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: observe_queue()] [Queue size overflow] At line 479, queue.len() is cast to i64 - if queue size exceeds i64::MAX, can this cause integer overflow or panic? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_reset()] [Round underflow] At line 188, if ResetSignal::TargetRound contains 0 or is less than current round, can this cause the validator to reset to an invalid state or skip necessary cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_incoming_metadata()] [Weak randomness source] Does S::generate() at line 146 use cryptographically secure randomness generation, or can predictable entropy sources allow attackers to predict future shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: broadcast_aug_data()] [Aug data collision] If two validators generate the same aug data using D::generate() at line 309, can this cause signature aggregation to fail or produce invalid certificates? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Signature malleability] Does msg.verify() check for signature malleability, or can an attacker modify signatures in ways that pass verification but change message hashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Channel ordering] The decision_rx channel at line 387 is unbounded - if randomness decisions arrive out of order (e.g., round N+1 before round N), does process_randomness() handle this correctly or corrupt block_queue state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: start()] [Verified message backpressure] If verified_msg_rx at line 390 receives messages faster than they can be processed, and the channel is unbounded, can this cause memory exhaustion even though messages are verified? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_reset()] [Channel draining] At line 384, incoming_blocks is drained with try_next() in a while loop, but if new blocks arrive during draining, can some be missed and processed after reset? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_response()] [Response serialization failure] At lines 216-217, if to_bytes() fails (which triggers expect), does this panic the entire RandManager task and halt randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel capacity] The unbounded channels created at line 97 for decision_tx/decision_rx have no capacity limits - can flooding these channels with invalid randomness decisions cause unbounded memory growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch mismatch] If epoch_state.epoch at line 99 doesn't match the epoch in incoming blocks or messages, can validators from different epochs interfere with each other's randomness generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: verification_task()] [Cross-epoch messages] Does msg.verify() at line 239 explicitly check that message epoch equals epoch_state.epoch, or can messages from previous/future epochs pass verification and corrupt current epoch state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: process_reset()] [Epoch cleanup] When reset occurs at lines 190-191, is epoch_state properly updated or validated, or can stale epoch state persist across resets causing validators to operate with wrong validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Validator set changes] The epoch_state at line 53 contains the validator set - if the validator set changes mid-epoch, does RandManager properly handle this or continue using stale validator lists for signature verification? (Critical)",
