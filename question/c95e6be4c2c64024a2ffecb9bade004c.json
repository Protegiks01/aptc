  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Information leak via errors] CheckerError::MissingDataError exposes the exact key name 'build_commit_hash' (line 100) - does this leak information about system internals that attackers could use to craft targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Inconsistent error handling] Target node missing data returns Some/None pattern (lines 105-111) while baseline returns early - can this asymmetry be exploited to create states where compromised target nodes aren't properly flagged? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Silent failure] When target_build_commit_hash is None, only a debug! log is emitted (line 137-139) - can attackers exploit this silent failure mode to hide version mismatches by manipulating target provider data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Vec manipulation] check_results vec is mutated throughout the function (lines 92, 108, 115) - can race conditions during concurrent check() calls cause results from different checks to be mixed or lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Result ordering] Results are pushed to check_results in specific order - can attackers exploit result ordering to manipulate how CheckSummary aggregates scores, potentially hiding critical failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing attack] The string equality comparison baseline_build_commit_hash == target_build_commit_hash (line 116) - does this use constant-time comparison? Can attackers use timing side-channels to infer correct hash prefixes and gradually reconstruct valid hashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Hash collision] Git commit hashes are being compared as strings - can attackers exploit hash collisions or shortened hashes to make malicious builds appear legitimate by matching only partial hash prefixes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Unicode normalization] Are the hash strings normalized before comparison? Can attackers use Unicode equivalence or homoglyph attacks to bypass comparison with visually identical but byte-different hashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty string bypass] The TODO comment (lines 4-6) mentions build_commit_hash can be empty string in containers - can attackers exploit this to make empty == empty match pass validation even when versions are actually different? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Whitespace manipulation] Does string comparison trim whitespace? Can attackers add leading/trailing whitespace to hashes to bypass exact equality checks while appearing valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Case sensitivity] Are git commit hashes compared case-sensitively? Can attackers exploit case differences to bypass validation (e.g., 'ABC123' vs 'abc123')? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Score manipulation] Matching hashes get score 100 (line 119), mismatches get 50 (line 128) - can attackers exploit the 50-point score for mismatches to keep nodes appearing partially healthy despite running malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Integer overflow] Score is u8 type - although values 0, 50, 100 are hardcoded, can any arithmetic on scores in CheckSummary::from() cause integer overflow when aggregating multiple CheckResults? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Score weighting bypass] The 50-point score for mismatch suggests partial credit - does this conflict with security models where version mismatch should be binary fail/pass? Can attackers exploit partial scoring to evade detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Arithmetic precision] When CheckSummary aggregates scores using integer division (types.rs line 59), can rounding errors in average calculation mask critical version mismatches among many passing checks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [String concatenation DoS] Long hash strings are formatted multiple times - can attackers provide extremely long fake hashes causing memory exhaustion through repeated string allocations in format! operations?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Headline manipulation] Headlines are hardcoded strings (lines 118, 127) - can the Self::build_result() implementation be exploited to inject arbitrary headline content through stack corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Explanation injection] CheckResult explanations are user-visible - can attackers craft hash values containing newlines, ANSI codes, or HTML/JavaScript to perform injection attacks in web UIs displaying these results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Result<Vec> semantics] Returning Ok(vec![...]) with error CheckResults vs Err(CheckerError) - can attackers exploit confusion between error types to bypass upstream error handling expecting CheckerError? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Vec capacity] No capacity pre-allocation for check_results vec - can many CheckResults cause repeated reallocations and performance degradation exploitable for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Early return bypass] Multiple return paths (lines 84, 97, 142) - can attackers manipulate execution flow to hit specific return paths that skip validation or security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Error context loss] When returning CheckerError::MissingDataError (line 98), context from baseline provider failure is wrapped in anyhow! - does this lose critical error details needed for security incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/build_version.rs] [Function: check()] [Concurrent check() calls] The async trait implementation allows concurrent invocations - if check() is called simultaneously on same BuildVersionChecker instance, can race conditions corrupt check_results or config access?
