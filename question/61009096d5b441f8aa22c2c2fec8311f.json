  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [All wrappers] [Query parameter parsing] Are these wrappers safely usable as query parameters, or could query string encoding differences cause validation bypasses when FromStr is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [All wrappers] [Request body parsing] When these wrappers appear in request bodies, does JSON/binary deserialization properly validate all fields, or could crafted request bodies inject invalid wrapper values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [IdentifierWrapper] [Move compatibility] Are all identifiers that pass IdentifierWrapper validation guaranteed to be valid in Move's identifier syntax, or could discrepancies cause transaction failures during Move compilation/execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [IdentifierWrapper] [Module/function resolution] When IdentifierWrapper is used to specify Move modules or functions in API calls, could identifier confusion attacks cause unintended code execution by referencing wrong modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [EventGuid] [Event stream security] Could EventGuid manipulation allow an attacker to subscribe to events from accounts they don't control, leaking sensitive transaction information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [StateKeyWrapper] [State access control] Does StateKeyWrapper enforce any access control on which state keys can be queried via API, or could attackers query sensitive internal state that should be restricted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [All functions] [Panic safety] Are there any unwrap(), expect(), or panic!() calls hidden in the dependencies (Identifier, StateKey, EventKey) that could cause API endpoint crashes when processing malicious inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [All functions] [Error message injection] Could error messages returned from validation failures contain user-controlled input that enables injection attacks in logs or error responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/wrappers.rs] [All functions] [Error handling consistency] Are errors handled consistently across all wrapper types, or could inconsistent error handling create confusion about which validation errors are critical vs. recoverable? (Low)"
