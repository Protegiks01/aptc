  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Network/Safety rules coupling] If network message handlers and safety rules (vote signing) share mutexes for validator state, can malicious network messages trigger panics that prevent safety rules from executing, enabling equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Panic amplification DoS] Can an attacker trigger a single panic that poisons multiple mutexes in a chain (A poisons B, B poisons C, etc.), causing cascading validator crashes that take down >1/3 of the network and halt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Restart loop DoS] If poisoned locks persist across restarts (e.g., in memory-mapped state), can validators enter an infinite crash-restart loop when trying to lock() during initialization, requiring manual state wipes to recover? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Thread exhaustion] Can an attacker cause repeated panics in short-lived threads holding mutexes, forcing the validator to spawn new threads continuously until thread limit is reached, causing OOM and process termination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [BLS signature aggregation race] If BLS signature aggregation for quorum certificates uses Mutex to protect partial signature state and a panic occurs, can this cause validators to produce different aggregated signatures for the same QC, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [VRF state poisoning] If VRF leader election state is protected by Mutex and a panic poisons it, can this cause different validators to compute different leaders for the same round, causing proposal conflicts and safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: into_inner()] [Key rotation vulnerability] During validator key rotation, if into_inner() panics while extracting old keys from Mutex protection, are old keys properly zeroized, or can they remain in memory/logs creating cryptographic vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Monitoring blind spots] If monitoring/metrics code panics and poisons mutexes protecting health check state, can validators appear healthy to orchestration systems while actually being unable to participate in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Backup/restore integrity] During state backup operations, if Mutex-protected state is copied and a panic occurs mid-copy, will the backup be marked as corrupted, or could silent corruption lead to unrecoverable state when restored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Upgrade path safety] During validator binary upgrades, if old and new code versions use different panic handling for poisoned locks, can this cause upgrade failures or state inconsistency across the validator fleet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/mutex.rs] [Function: lock()] [Emergency shutdown] If a validator needs emergency shutdown (e.g., detected compromise), can poisoned locks prevent clean shutdown, leaving partial state on disk that causes crashes on restart and extends the compromise window? (High)"
