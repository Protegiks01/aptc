  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Error Information Leak] If the API call (line 73) fails, does the error handling leak sensitive information like internal paths, database queries, validator configurations, or network topology through verbose error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Integer Overflow in Balance] When AccountBalanceResponse returns balance amounts, can extremely large values cause integer overflow in display formatting, fee calculations, or downstream processing, showing incorrect balances to users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Negative Balance Display] Can malicious or corrupted API responses return negative balance values that aren't properly validated, causing the CLI to display impossible negative balances that could facilitate fraud? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Balance Precision Loss] Does the balance response handling maintain full precision for large amounts? Can rounding errors or floating-point conversions cause significant value loss when displaying balances, especially for accounts with huge stake amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Metadata Injection] Can attackers inject malicious metadata fields in AccountBalanceResponse (sequence_number, operators, lockup_expiration_time_utc) that exploit parsing vulnerabilities in the CLI display logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Balance Array Confusion] If multiple balances are returned in AccountBalanceResponse.balances vector, does the CLI correctly sum them? Can attackers exploit balance aggregation logic to hide funds or double-count amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Stake Calculation Bypass] Can an attacker provide an account that has both regular balance and stake, then toggle stake_amount flag to detect discrepancies between reported total_stake and actual aggregated stake amounts, indicating accounting bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Operator Stake Leak via Total Stake] Does total_stake_account (line 56) include operator-delegated stake?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Stake State Inconsistency] Can an attacker query stake_amount balances during epoch transitions or validator set changes when stake states are temporarily inconsistent, extracting information about pending validator additions/removals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Unlocked Stake Confusion] Does the total_stake query differentiate between locked and unlocked stake? Can attackers exploit ambiguous stake reporting to claim liquid balances are locked, facilitating social engineering or fraud? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountBalanceCommand::execute()] [Delegation Pool Exposure] Can querying total_stake_account for delegation pool addresses expose individual delegator balances, amounts, or participation that should remain private within the pool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountCommand::execute()] [Pattern Matching Exhaustion] If new AccountCommand variants are added beyond Balance (line 19), can the match statement (line 25) fail to handle them, causing panics or undefined behavior when users invoke undocumented commands?
