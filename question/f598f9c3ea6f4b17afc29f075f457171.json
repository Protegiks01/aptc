  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Validator transaction position] ValidatorTxn counter=20 places it before transaction prologues (25+) - is this correct for validator transactions that should potentially execute with special priority? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: script_hash] [Hash length validation] Vec<u8> script_hash fields have no length constraints - can attackers create sessions with gigabyte-sized script_hash vectors causing memory exhaustion across all validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: script_hash] [Hash content validation] Are script_hash vectors validated to be actual hashes, or can arbitrary byte sequences be injected, potentially bypassing script verification that expects valid hash formats? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: script_hash] [Hash collision] Can two different scripts produce identical script_hash values due to weak hashing, allowing script substitution attacks where malicious code is executed under a legitimate script's session?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: sequence_number] [Integer overflow] Can sequence_number u64 values overflow after 2^64 transactions from a single account, and if so, does overflow wrap to 0 allowing replay of earlier transactions?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: nonce] [Nonce generation] Is nonce generation cryptographically secure, or can attackers predict future nonces and pre-create orderless transactions that will be valid in the future? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: nonce] [Nonce-sequence overlap] Can a sender have both sequence_number-based (Txn) and nonce-based (OrderlessTxn) sessions active simultaneously, and can nonce values collide with sequence_number values causing confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Struct field: nonce] [Nonce overflow] Can nonce u64 values overflow, and does overflow cause previously used nonces to become valid again, enabling replay attacks? (High)",
