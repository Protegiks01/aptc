  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Consensus impact] [Vote message prioritization] Can latency-based peer sorting be manipulated to ensure Byzantine validators receive votes first, giving them timing advantages to equivocate before honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Consensus impact] [Asymmetric message delivery] Can different validators send messages using different protocols, causing asymmetric delivery times that break consensus synchronization assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Consensus impact] [Epoch boundary messages] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can messages be lost due to peer list updates causing consensus to hang between epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [State sync impact] [Chunk request routing] If RPC timeouts are too short for large state sync chunks, can honest peers be incorrectly marked as slow and disconnected, preventing successful state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [State sync impact] [Chunk response validation] Can send_to_peer_rpc_raw be exploited to inject malicious state sync responses with incorrect state roots, causing validator state divergence? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Mempool impact] [Mempool synchronization] If send_to_peers fails for transaction broadcasts, does mempool properly retry or can transactions be permanently lost from the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Resource exhaustion] [Message queue flooding] Can an attacker flood send_to_peer calls faster than the network can deliver, causing unbounded queue growth and memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Resource exhaustion] [RPC timeout accumulation] Can an attacker open thousands of RPC requests with long timeouts causing accumulation of pending futures and task exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Resource exhaustion] [Protocol conversion overhead] Can sending to many peers with different protocols cause excessive CPU usage in to_bytes_by_protocol serialization, degrading node performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkServiceEvents] [Event consumption] Does into_network_and_events consume the event streams, preventing proper cleanup if called multiple times or at wrong lifecycle stages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkServiceEvents] [Missing network validation] Can network_and_events HashMap contain events from unexpected networks, causing applications to process messages from wrong network contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Trait: NetworkMessageTrait] [Trait bound bypass] Can unsafe code circumvent the Clone + Message + Send + Sync bounds to pass non-thread-safe messages, causing data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Trait: NetworkClientInterface] [Async trait safety] Can the async_trait macro generate code with subtle lifetime issues that cause dangling references during async operations? (Medium)",

(Note: currently unimplemented) (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [External integration] [PeerId validation] Are PeerIds validated to prevent ID collision attacks where attackers impersonate legitimate validators? (High)",
