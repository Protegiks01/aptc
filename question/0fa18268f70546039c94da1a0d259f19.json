  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/translated_v1_event/mod.rs] [Schema: TranslatedV1EventSchema] [Version Reorg] During blockchain reorganizations, are translated V1 events properly deleted for reverted transactions, or can stale translations persist causing duplicate or invalid events?
