  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Read-Write Race] If one thread reads from write_resource while another modifies it, can this cause data races even though Rust's borrow checker should prevent this? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Reorg Handling] If a blockchain reorg occurs and transactions are reverted, does the indexer properly delete MoveResource entries, or do stale resources remain in the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Delete-Write Ordering] If a resource is deleted and recreated in rapid succession across transaction boundaries, can race conditions cause the delete to be processed after the new write, incorrectly marking the new resource as deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Batch Processing Order] When processing multiple MoveResources in a transaction batch, if processing order doesn't match write_set_change_index order, can this create temporary state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [API Type Trust] At line 37, WriteResource from aptos_api_types is trusted - can a malicious API server or man-in-the-middle provide crafted WriteResource objects bypassing blockchain validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Delete Resource Validation] At line 59, DeleteResource is accepted without validation - can an attacker forge DeleteResource objects to incorrectly mark resources as deleted in the indexer? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Type Conversion Safety] Does the conversion from APIMoveStructTag to internal MoveStructTag at line 42 preserve all security-relevant information, or is data lost that could enable attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Address Format Mismatch] At line 49, write_resource.address.to_string() is called - can different address representations from the API cause duplicate database entries for the same logical resource? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [State Key Hash Validation] At line 54, state_key_hash is standardized but never validated against actual blockchain state - can an attacker provide incorrect hashes causing indexer to track wrong state changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Hash Uniqueness] Is state_key_hash guaranteed unique per resource, or can collisions occur where multiple resources share the same hash causing indexer confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Hash Length Attack] Does state_key_hash have a fixed length requirement, and can shorter or longer hashes cause database errors or query failures after standardization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Hash Encoding] Is state_key_hash expected to be hex-encoded, and if it contains non-hex characters, does standardize_address handle this correctly or introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Serde Deserialization] The Deserialize trait - when MoveResource is deserialized from external sources, can malformed input cause panics or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Serialize Attack] Can serializing MoveResource with malicious data values create output that crashes or exploits systems deserializing it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Field Count Mismatch] The FieldCount trait is used - if the struct definition changes but FieldCount isn't updated, can this cause buffer overruns or memory corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Version Monotonicity] Is transaction_version guaranteed to be monotonically increasing, or can out-of-order transactions cause the indexer to process later versions before earlier ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Version Skipping] If transaction versions skip numbers (e.g., 100, 101, 105), does the indexer correctly detect missing transactions, or does it assume continuity and miss important state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Version Rollback] If transaction_version goes backward (indicating a reorg), does the indexer properly remove resources from later versions, or do deleted resources remain in the database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Version Query Attack] Can an attacker query resources at a specific transaction_version and cause the indexer to recompute state, potentially causing DoS through expensive database queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Block Height Validation] At line 45, transaction_block_height is set without validation - can this be inconsistent with blockchain consensus, causing applications to trust incorrect block heights? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Height Monotonicity] Can transaction_block_height decrease between sequential transactions, indicating invalid data or reorgs that the indexer doesn't handle properly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Height Mismatch] If write and delete operations for the same resource have different transaction_block_height values, does this indicate a problem, and is it detected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Module Validation] At line 50, module is set from parsed_data without validating it's a valid Move module identifier - can invalid modules break queries or cause indexer errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Name Validation] At line 48, name is set without checking it's a valid Move struct name - can malformed names cause parsing errors in downstream applications? (Low)",
