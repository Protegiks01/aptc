  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/abstract_domain_derive/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_join_field()] [Combine Semantics] Does the macro assume specific semantics for JoinResult::combine (e.g., Changed dominates Unchanged), and could changes to combine's definition break all derived abstract domains? (High)",
