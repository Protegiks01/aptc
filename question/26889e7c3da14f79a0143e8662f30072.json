  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Integration: Combined traits] [Cross-trait Attack] Can the combination of resource, aggregator, and delayed field views in TExecutorView be exploited to bypass checks that exist in individual traits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Optimization: is_resource_groups_split_in_change_set_capable] [Split Bypass] Can attackers force split or non-split behavior by manipulating this capability flag to cause gas calculation inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Optimization: is_resource_groups_split_in_change_set_capable] [Inconsistent Split] Can different validators have different split capabilities, causing non-deterministic execution and consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Optimization: release_group_cache + split] [Split Cache Corruption] Can releasing group cache while split optimization is active cause cache corruption and state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Compatibility: resource_exists_in_group safety] [Invariant Bypass] Can the backwards compatibility mechanism that fails transactions instead of halting be exploited to griefing attacks or censorship? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Compatibility: INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR] [Error Abuse] Can attackers intentionally trigger INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR for resource groups to make specific transactions fail for griefing purposes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Compatibility: Resource vs ResourceGroup] [Behavior Divergence] Can differences between resource and resource group error handling (assert vs fail) be exploited for inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Storage: read_state_value enforcement] [Module Write Bypass] Can bypassing read_state_value() before module writes allow unauthorized module overwrites without read-before-write checks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-types/src/resolver.rs] [Edge Case: Empty resource groups] [Empty Group Handling] Can empty resource groups (num_tagged_resources = 0) cause inconsistencies between storage (not stored) and calculation (size 0)? (Medium)",
