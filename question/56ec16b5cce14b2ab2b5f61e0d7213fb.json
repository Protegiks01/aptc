  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_module()] [Cache poisoning] If the BTreeMap lookup result is cached elsewhere, can an attacker poison the cache by repeatedly requesting non-existent modules, affecting performance or causing wrong module loading? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_immediate_dependencies()] [Error propagation] If one dependency lookup fails mid-iteration, does the collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>() properly short-circuit, or can partial results leak into the system causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_immediate_dependencies()] [Dependency amplification] Can a module declare thousands of immediate dependencies to cause memory exhaustion when the Vec is allocated, especially during parallel transaction processing?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_transitive_dependencies_()] [Duplicate processing] Since all_deps.push(module) is called before recursing, can the same module be added multiple times to the Vec, causing unnecessary memory usage and processing overhead?
