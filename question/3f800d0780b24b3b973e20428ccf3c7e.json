  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Round skip detection] Does the equality check at line 70 prevent validators from skipping rounds even with valid timeout certificates? Should it use >= instead? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Timeout round semantics] At line 67, highest_timeout_round() is compared with QC round - are timeout rounds and QC rounds directly comparable or do they need normalization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Genesis block handling] Does the validation at lines 44-47 properly handle genesis blocks in new epochs that may have round 0 or special values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Epoch boundary] At epoch boundaries, can a proposal from epoch N be accepted in early epoch N+1 before validator sets are updated, causing authorization bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch rollover] Does epoch() at line 30 handle epoch number rollover (unlikely but possible with u64), or can overflow cause epoch confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Struct: ProposalMsg] [Thread safety] Is ProposalMsg Sync/Send safe for concurrent access across threads, or can shared references cause data races during verification? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature scheme] Does validate_signature() at line 106 use the correct BLS signature scheme for Aptos, or can scheme confusion attacks allow invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Public key validation] Are public keys in ValidatorVerifier validated to be on the correct curve before signature verification, or can invalid point attacks succeed? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Chain continuity] At lines 52-58, does the parent_id check ensure continuous chain growth, or can gaps in the chain be exploited to create forks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [QC signature aggregation] Are QC signatures verified somewhere before trusting certified_block().round() at line 66, or is this assumed to be pre-validated? (Critical)",
