  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious BCS-encoded SignedTransaction that exploits the MAX_SIGNED_TRANSACTION_DEPTH limit (16) to cause stack overflow or bypass validation, potentially leading to node crashes or accepting invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [Input Validation Bypass] Can an attacker submit a SignedTransaction with an empty Script payload that passes BCS deserialization but bypasses the validate_script() check, allowing execution of invalid bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transactions_batch()] [Batch Deserialization] Does the BCS batch deserialization lack depth limits unlike single transaction deserialization, allowing attackers to submit deeply nested structures causing stack overflow and API crashes? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: validate_entry_function_payload_format()] [Module Name Validation] Can an attacker craft malformed module identifiers that pass verify_module_identifier() but cause issues in downstream VM execution, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: validate_entry_function_payload_format()] [Function Name Validation] Can specially crafted function identifiers with unicode or special characters bypass verify_function_identifier() validation, causing VM execution errors or type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: validate_entry_function_payload_format()] [Type Argument Recursion] Can an attacker submit entry function type arguments with recursive depth exceeding limits, causing the MoveType.verify(0) check to fail inconsistently across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: validate_script()] [Empty Bytecode Check] Does the empty bytecode check only validate code().is_empty() without checking for bytecode validity, allowing submission of malformed bytecode that crashes the VM? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: validate_script()] [Type Arguments Validation] Can script type arguments contain circular references or excessively nested generics that pass MoveType verification but cause VM execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [ModuleBundle Deprecation] Can an attacker exploit the ModuleBundle payload rejection logic to cause denial of service by submitting many deprecated payloads that consume validation resources? (Low)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [Multisig Validation Gap] In TransactionPayload::Multisig validation, if transaction_payload is None, does the code skip all payload validation, allowing empty multisig transactions that violate protocol invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [V1 Payload Script+Multisig] Can an attacker submit a V1 Script payload with is_multisig() set to true to bypass the validation check that rejects script multisig combinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [V1 Empty Payload] Can non-multisig transactions with TransactionExecutable::Empty bypass validation, allowing submission of transactions with no executable code? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signed_transaction()] [Encrypted Payload] Is the EncryptedPayload rejection properly enforced in all code paths, or can it be bypassed through BCS deserialization of nested payload types? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Struct: SubmitTransactionPost] [Verify Bypass] Does the VerifyInput trait implementation for SubmitTransactionPost::Bcs always return Ok(()), allowing submission of completely invalid BCS-encoded transactions without any verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Struct: SubmitTransactionsBatchPost] [Batch Verify Bypass] Similarly, does SubmitTransactionsBatchPost::Bcs skip all verification, enabling attackers to submit batches of malformed transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate()] [Signature Validation] Can an attacker craft a transaction with a signature that fails verify_signature() but still contains partial valid signature data that could be exploited in downstream signature aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate()] [Zero-Padded Signature Attack] Does the simulation accept any zero-padded signature without validating the padding format, potentially allowing signatures with embedded malicious data in padding bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: override_gas_parameters()] [Authenticator Reuse] When creating a new SignedTransaction with modified gas parameters, does reusing the authenticator from the original transaction create a signature mismatch that could cause consensus issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signing_message()] [Multi-Agent Signing] In multi-agent transaction signing message generation, can an attacker manipulate the secondary_signers order to create different signing messages for the same logical transaction? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: get_signing_message()] [Signing Message Collision] Can two different RawTransactionWithData structures generate the same signing message through hash collision, enabling signature replay across different transaction contexts? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate_transaction()] [Gas Price Manipulation] When estimate_gas_unit_price is true, can an attacker exploit race conditions in gas price estimation to get outdated prices that no longer reflect network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate_transaction()] [Gas Estimation Division by Zero] When gas_unit_price is 0, the code sets max_account_gas_units to balance without division, but does this create exploits where attackers can simulate unlimited gas transactions? (High)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate_transaction()] [Balance View Function] Can an attacker submit simulation requests for accounts with manipulated view function results (coin::balance), causing incorrect gas estimations that differ from actual execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate_transaction()] [Max Gas Calculation] The min() of max_account_gas_units and max_number_of_gas_units could underflow or produce incorrect results with edge case balances - can this be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: api/src/transactions.rs] [Function: simulate_transaction()] [Gas Parameter Override] Can the gas parameter override logic be exploited to simulate transactions with gas parameters that would be rejected in actual execution, misleading users about transaction feasibility? (Medium)"
