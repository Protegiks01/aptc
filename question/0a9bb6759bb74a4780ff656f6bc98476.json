(High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Shard Count Mismatch] If different shards are initialized with different num_shards values, can this cause message routing failures or incorrect shard assignment leading to transaction loss or duplication?

(Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [State Staleness] Does the executor service verify that state data from RemoteStateViewClient is current and consistent, or can stale state be used causing non-deterministic execution across shards?

  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Authentication] Does the executor service authenticate remote peers (shards and coordinator), or can any network peer connect and participate in execution by knowing the correct addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Message Size Limits] Are incoming messages from RemoteCoordinatorClient and RemoteCrossShardClient bounded in size, or can an attacker send extremely large messages causing memory exhaustion and crashes? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Connection Limits] Does the NetworkController limit the number of concurrent connections, or can an attacker exhaust file descriptors by opening excessive connections to the executor service? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Network Partition] If network partitions occur isolating some shards, does the executor service detect and handle this gracefully or continue attempting execution with incomplete shard participation?

  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Integer Parsing] Are integer fields in remote messages (shard_id, round_id, etc.) properly validated for range and consistency, or can malicious values cause index out-of-bounds or arithmetic errors?
