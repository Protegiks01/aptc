  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Imports: line 40] [External Logging Framework] setup_logging is imported from aptos_indexer_grpc_server_framework - can vulnerabilities in this external logging framework be exploited to inject malicious log handlers or intercept sensitive data being logged? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: wait_for_startup() line 182] [Join All Error Handling] futures::future::join_all() waits for all futures - if some futures hang indefinitely while others complete, can this cause the entire startup to block, creating a denial-of-service where the testnet never becomes available? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: run_shutdown_steps() line 494-499] [Sequential Shutdown Blocking] Shutdown steps execute sequentially with .await - if one step hangs or takes very long (e.g., waiting for Docker containers to stop), can this delay or prevent critical subsequent cleanup, especially during the second ctrl-c immediate exit window? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 424-429] [Post Healthy Step Sequential Execution] Post healthy steps run sequentially - if one step fails or hangs, can this prevent important steps like metadata application from completing, causing the indexer API to serve incorrect data despite appearing healthy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Struct: RunLocalnet line 76] [Force Restart Default] force_restart defaults to false - can an attacker who gains control of the CLI arguments enable force_restart to destroy existing testnet state without user awareness, causing data loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Struct: RunLocalnet line 106] [Log to Stdout Hidden Flag] log_to_stdout has hide = true - can this hidden flag be exploited to enable stdout logging in production environments where logs should be persisted to files, causing loss of security-critical audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 291] [Node Health Checker Exposure] node_health_checkers are cloned and passed to FaucetManager - if health checkers maintain mutable state, can the clone create race conditions where the faucet and other services have inconsistent views of node health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 340] [Connection String Boolean Flag] get_connection_string(None, false) uses a boolean for the last parameter - can confusion about this parameter's meaning lead to insecure connection configurations, such as disabling SSL/TLS for database connections? (Medium)"
