(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Integer Type Safety] The conversion 'as u64' at lines 24 and 43 from usize to u64 - on 128-bit systems (if they exist), could this truncate values and cause incorrect gas calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Type Confusion] Does the function validate that the Value types popped at lines 39-41 are actually Vec<u8>, or can type confusion allow passing other types that get reinterpreted as byte arrays? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Type Confusion] Can the pop_arg! macro at line 22 be tricked into extracting a non-Vec<u8> type, causing type safety violations in the Rust code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Argument Order Confusion] If Move code accidentally passes arguments in the wrong order (e.g., swapping pubkey and signature at lines 40-41), does this cause predictable failures or could it lead to security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Return Type Safety] The function returns Value::bool at lines 48, 54, and 60 - can the calling Move code misinterpret this boolean or ignore it, leading to unauthorized operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Return Type Safety] Does the Move VM properly handle the bool return value at line 28, or can calling code treat 'false' as 'key exists but invalid' rather than 'key is definitely invalid'? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Domain Separation Missing] Does verify_arbitrary_msg() at line 58 include proper domain separation (context strings), or can signatures from one application context be replayed in another context within Aptos? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Hash Function Ambiguity] Which hash function does verify_arbitrary_msg() use internally (SHA-512 is standard for Ed25519) - is it consistently applied, or can hash function confusion lead to cross-protocol attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Signature Scheme Mixing] Can this function be called with signatures generated under different Ed25519 variants (RFC8032 vs. IETF draft vs. ZIP-215), causing verification inconsistencies?

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Batch Verification Not Used] The function verifies one signature at a time - if transactions contain multiple signatures, is batch verification supported elsewhere, or does this sequential approach allow timing attacks to leak private key information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Missing Nonce/Sequence Check] The signature verification at line 58 only checks cryptographic validity - does it enforce transaction sequence numbers elsewhere, or can old valid signatures be replayed to double-spend? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_signature_verification()] [Multi-Signature Bypass] If transaction validation requires multiple signatures, can an attacker call this function multiple times with the same signature for different signers, bypassing multi-sig requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/signature.rs] [Function: native_ed25519_publickey_validation()] [Weak Key Acceptance] Does the validation at line 27 reject weak keys (e.g., keys derived from weak seeds, keys with known discrete logs), or can attackers register accounts with keys they can easily forge signatures for?
