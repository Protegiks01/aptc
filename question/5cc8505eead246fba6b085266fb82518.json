  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error propagation] When bcs::from_bytes fails, does the error message leak sensitive information about internal state that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Silent failures] Can try_from_bytes fail silently in some error paths, causing withdrawal events to be dropped without notification? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Upgrade compatibility] If the TokenWithdraw struct is modified in a protocol upgrade, can old events become unparseable causing loss of historical data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Static: TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE] [Type evolution] Can changes to TOKEN_WITHDRAW_TYPE through governance be exploited to reinterpret old withdrawal events as different operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Non-deterministic deserialization] Can BCS deserialization of TokenWithdraw produce different results on different validators due to floating-point operations or system-dependent behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Hash collisions] If withdrawal events are hashed for deduplication, can hash collisions cause legitimate withdrawals to be rejected as duplicates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdraw] [Timestamp dependencies] If withdrawal processing depends on block timestamps, can timestamp manipulation by validators affect which withdrawals are processed? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: id] [Collection name injection] Can the collection String in TokenDataId contain special characters or excessively long names that cause downstream parsing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw.rs] [Field: id] [Token name collision] If two tokens have the same name but different creators, can TokenId confusion cause withdrawal from the wrong token? (High)",
