  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: join()] [MAX_EDGE_SET_SIZE overflow] Can joining graphs cause edge sets to exceed MAX_EDGE_SET_SIZE, triggering the overflow behavior that replaces specific edges with weak epsilon borrows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: check_invariant()] [Disabled in release] Are all check_invariant() calls wrapped in debug_assert!, meaning they're disabled in production allowing invalid graphs to exist? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: check_invariant()] [Incomplete checks] Does check_invariant() check all necessary properties, or are there additional invariants (like path consistency, strong/weak flag correctness) that should be verified? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: id_consistency()] [Closure performance] Can the closure-based checking (line 422) cause performance issues with large graphs, leading to DoS during invariant checking? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: edge_consistency()] [MAX_EDGE_SET_SIZE check] Is the check for edge set size (lines 437-441) enforced during edge insertion, or can this limit be bypassed allowing unbounded edge sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: edge_consistency()] [Bidirectional mismatch] Can the parent-to-child and child-to-parent consistency checks (lines 442-450) miss cases where edges exist in one direction but not the other? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: edge_consistency()] [Empty edge sets] Are empty edge sets in borrowed_by properly cleaned up, or can they accumulate causing memory waste and inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: no_self_loops()] [Transitive cycles] Does no_self_loops() only check direct self-loops, missing multi-node cycles that could still cause issues during graph traversal? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/graph.rs] [Function: has_full_borrows()] [Panic on missing ref] Does the unwrap() (line 469) allow attackers to crash the VM by checking full borrows on deleted references? (High)",
