  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [OnDisk Integration] [Filesystem Permissions] If policies are not enforced at the application level for OnDiskStorage, are filesystem ACLs the only protection, and can misconfigurations expose validator private keys to unauthorized processes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [OnDisk Integration] [Policy Storage] Are Policy objects themselves stored on disk, and if so, are they protected from tampering, or can attackers modify policy files to grant themselves all capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [InMemory Integration] [Policy Application] Does InMemoryStorage enforce policies, or is it only for testing, and can production deployments accidentally use InMemoryStorage with inadequate policy enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [InMemory Integration] [Memory Leakage] Are policies in InMemoryStorage properly protected from memory inspection, or can attackers use memory dumping to extract both policies and the keys they protect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Crypto Operations] [Key Generation Policy] When creating new cryptographic keys, what policy is initially applied, and can race conditions during key creation allow momentary access before proper policies are set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Crypto Operations] [Key Import Policy] When importing private keys, are policy checks enforced before import, or can attackers import keys under permissive policies then change policies after import? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Crypto Operations] [Key Export Protection] Does Capability::Export implement additional safeguards like requiring multi-party approval or hardware security module validation before allowing private key export? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Crypto Operations] [Signing Policy Context] When using Capability::Sign, is the signing context (consensus round, message type) validated against policy, or can attackers with signing capability sign arbitrary malicious messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Crypto Operations] [Key Versioning] How do policies interact with key versioning during rotation - can old key versions be accessed with current policies, potentially allowing attackers to use compromised old keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Safety Rules Access] If policies are misconfigured for safety rules storage, can attackers read or modify the persistent safety data causing validators to double-sign and break BFT safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Epoch Key Rotation] During epoch transitions when validator keys rotate, are policies updated atomically with keys, or can race conditions allow access to keys under old policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Quorum Certificate Storage] Are policies enforced for storing and retrieving quorum certificates, or can attackers with Write capability inject forged QCs to manipulate consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Consensus Safety] [Validator Set Changes] When validator set changes during reconfiguration, are policies updated for new validators, or can departing validators retain access to signing keys through stale policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Performance] [Policy Evaluation Cost] Is policy evaluation O(n) in the number of permissions, and can attackers create policies with thousands of permissions to cause validation slowdowns during high-frequency signing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Performance] [Policy Caching] Are policies cached to avoid repeated deserialization, and if not cached, can policy loading become a bottleneck degrading validator block proposal performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Performance] [String Comparison] Is Identity::User comparison optimized, or do naive string comparisons on every access check create O(n*m) performance degradation in high-throughput scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Audit] [Policy Change Logging] Are policy changes audit-logged with tamper-evident timestamps and actor identities, allowing detection of malicious policy modifications after a breach? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Audit] [Access Logging] When capabilities are exercised (especially Export and Sign), are these operations logged immutably for forensic analysis after security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Audit] [Policy Review] Is there a mechanism to regularly review and audit active policies to detect overly permissive configurations before they are exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Testing] [Negative Test Coverage] Are there sufficient tests verifying that policies correctly DENY unauthorized access, or are tests biased toward verifying authorized access works, missing security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Testing] [Backend Consistency] Are policies tested across all storage backends (Vault, OnDisk, InMemory) to ensure consistent enforcement, or can backend-specific bugs lead to policy bypasses in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Testing] [Concurrency Testing] Are there stress tests for concurrent policy access/updates to uncover race conditions, or can race condition bugs only manifest under production load during consensus stress? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Default Config] [Secure Defaults] What are the default policies in fresh Aptos deployments, and are they secure-by-default or do they require manual hardening that operators might skip, exposing validators to attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Default Config] [Policy Templates] Are secure policy templates provided for common scenarios (single validator, validator pool, testnet), and can template misuse lead to accidental exposure of production keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Default Config] [Migration Path] When upgrading Aptos versions with policy changes, is there a safe migration path, or can policy incompatibilities cause validators to become inoperable during critical network upgrades? (High)"
