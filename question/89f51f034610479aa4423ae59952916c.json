  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Result Vector Growth] The result vector at line 71 is grown by push() in loop - if ordered_blocks is very large, can repeated push() cause heap fragmentation or allocation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Double Execution] If the same ExecutedBlock appears multiple times in ordered_blocks vector, will it be executed multiple times, potentially causing double-spending or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block Ownership] Does iterating with 'for b in ordered_blocks' (line 73) move ownership or clone blocks? Can this cause use-after-free if blocks are referenced elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Type Safety] At line 76, ExecutedBlock::new(b.block().clone(), compute_result) creates new ExecutedBlock - does clone() create deep copy preventing original block mutation, or can shared references cause aliasing bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [State Compute Result Tampering] Can the compute_result returned from execution_proxy.compute() be tampered with before being wrapped in ExecutedBlock::new(), bypassing state integrity checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block Clone Safety] Does b.block().clone() at line 76 preserve all cryptographic signatures and commitments, or can cloning strip security metadata enabling block forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Execution Result Correlation] Is there validation that the compute_result from execution_proxy.compute() actually corresponds to the block being executed, or can results be swapped between blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Trait: StatelessPipeline] [Type Confusion] The StatelessPipeline trait uses associated types Request/Response (lines 54-55) - can type confusion attacks exploit implementation differences if multiple pipeline phases return incompatible types? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Trait: StatelessPipeline] [Pipeline Ordering] Does the NAME constant (line 57)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionPhase] [Trait Object Safety] The execution_proxy field (line 43) uses Arc<dyn StateComputer> - can downcasting attacks exploit trait object vtable to call unintended implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does new() at line 47-49 validate that execution_proxy is non-null and properly initialized, or can uninitialized/mock StateComputer be injected? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Batch Atomicity] Does the execution of ordered_blocks vector constitute an atomic batch, or if one block fails, are previous successful executions kept, leading to partial state updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [State Dependency] When executing blocks sequentially at line 73-84, does each block's execution depend on the previous block's state being committed first, or can parallel execution cause state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Inter-Block Verification] Is there validation that consecutive blocks in ordered_blocks form a valid chain (parent_id relationships), or can non-contiguous blocks be batched together? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Epoch Boundary] If ordered_blocks spans an epoch boundary (reconfiguration), does execution handle validator set changes correctly, or can this cause consensus split? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionResponse] [Response Integrity] ExecutionResponse contains block_id and inner result (lines 37-40) - can an attacker forge ExecutionResponse to claim successful execution without actually executing blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Block ID Mismatch] The block_id in ExecutionResponse (line 79-80, 87-88) is set before knowing all blocks succeed - can mismatched block_id cause buffer_manager to commit wrong blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Success Response] At line 87-90, ExecutionResponse with Ok(result) is returned - does the buffer_manager verify that the result vector length matches ordered_blocks length to prevent silent block drops? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Struct: ExecutionResponse] [Error Response Leakage] When returning Err(e) in ExecutionResponse, does the error contain sensitive information (internal state, keys) that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Impl: Display for ExecutionRequest] [Information Leak] The Display implementation at line 31-35 prints ordered_blocks debug - can this leak sensitive block content (transactions, validator info) in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Impl: Debug for ExecutionRequest] [Debug Output Safety] Debug trait delegates to Display (line 25-29) - can verbose debug logs expose attack surface or internal state that aids reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/execution_phase.rs] [Architecture] [Decoupled Mode Safety] Comments state this is used when consensus.decoupled = true (line 15) - does the decoupled execution mode introduce timing windows where consensus and execution can diverge? (High)",
