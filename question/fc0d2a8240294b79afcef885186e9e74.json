(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PublicKey::aggregate()] [Input validation] Does the aggregate function validate that the input vector contains at least one public key, or can an empty vector cause a panic or undefined behavior leading to consensus crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PublicKey::aggregate()] [Subgroup check bypass] The aggregate function sets validate=false when calling blst::AggregatePublicKey::aggregate - can an attacker exploit this by including invalid subgroup elements that weren't properly PoP-verified to create forged aggregate signatures?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PublicKey::subgroup_check()] [Small subgroup attack] If a public key passes the on-curve check during deserialization but fails subgroup check, and this function is not called before verification, can an attacker exploit small subgroup elements to forge signatures?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_keys.rs] [Function: PublicKey::to_bytes()] [Compression bypass] Does the to_bytes function use point compression, and if so, can an attacker exploit compression malleability to create multiple byte representations of the same key causing verification inconsistencies?
