  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a target_path containing '../' sequences or absolute paths to write the cloned repository outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or Move framework code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Path Traversal] Does clone() validate that target_path doesn't contain symbolic links that could be exploited to redirect the repository clone to arbitrary filesystem locations, enabling unauthorized file overwrites? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Path Traversal] Can the repo_path parameter in checkout() be manipulated with path traversal sequences to execute git operations on repositories outside the intended dependency directory structure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Path Traversal] Is repo_path in fetch_origin() validated to prevent operations on system git repositories (e.g., '/etc/git', '/usr/local/git') that could compromise the host system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Path Traversal] Does reset_hard() verify that repo_path points to a valid, sandboxed location before executing 'git reset --hard', preventing destructive operations on unintended repositories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Protocol Confusion] Can an attacker specify malicious git URLs using dangerous protocols (e.g., 'ext::', 'fd::', 'file://' with privileged paths) that bypass security restrictions and access local filesystem or execute commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [URL Injection] Does clone() validate that the URL points to an authorized git repository host, or can attackers clone from internal/private repositories by providing URLs like 'http://localhost:8080/internal-repo.git'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Git Submodule Attack] If the cloned repository contains malicious git submodules with dangerous URLs or hooks, can they be exploited to execute arbitrary code during the clone operation despite stdout/stderr being redirected to null? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Git Hooks Exploitation] Does the cloned repository's git hooks (pre-commit, post-checkout, etc.) get executed during subsequent git operations, allowing malicious package authors to execute arbitrary code on developer/validator machines? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a race condition between checking if target_path exists and cloning the repository, allowing an attacker to create a symlink at that path after the check but before the clone, redirecting the operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent checkout() operations on the same repo_path from multiple threads cause race conditions that result in inconsistent repository state or partially checked out malicious code?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Race Condition] If multiple processes simultaneously call fetch_origin() on the same repository, can race conditions in git's object database corruption or lock contention lead to corrupted dependency resolution?
