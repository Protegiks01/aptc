  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [get_throughput_from_samples division by zero] When get_throughput_from_samples() calculates throughput at lines 82-97, if time_diff is zero due to identical timestamps in samples, could this cause division by zero panics that crash the status endpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Throughput calculation precision] The throughput calculation uses f64 arithmetic in get_throughput_from_samples() - if version or size_bytes values are very large, could floating-point precision loss lead to displayed throughput values that are orders of magnitude incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Sample array bounds] In get_throughput_from_samples(), partition_point is used to find sample indices - if the samples array is mutated concurrently while being read, could this cause out-of-bounds access when indexing progress.samples[index]? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [OnceCell initialization race] LIVE_DATA_SERVICE and HISTORICAL_DATA_SERVICE use OnceCell::get() at lines 21 and 32 - if multiple threads race to initialize these cells simultaneously during startup, could this cause inconsistent state or double initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [Service initialization order] If status_page() is called during service initialization when get_connection_manager() may not be fully ready, could this expose partially initialized state or cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Version comparison confusion] When displaying both current_version (last sample) and known_latest_version at lines 72-77 and 108, if current_version > known_latest_version due to race conditions, could this confuse operators or monitoring systems about the true system state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Progress.samples ordering] The code assumes progress.samples is ordered by timestamp in get_throughput_from_samples() - if samples are inserted out of order due to concurrent updates, could partition_point return incorrect indices leading to wrong throughput calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Stream ID collision] If two streams have identical IDs (due to UUID collision or implementation bug), the DashMap in ConnectionManager might overwrite one - would this cause the status page to display incorrect stream counts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [Container nesting limit] The HTML structure uses nested containers (Section -> Div -> Table) at lines 25-28 and 36-39 - does the build_html library or browsers have nesting limits that could be exceeded if more complex structures are added, causing rendering failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Misleading metrics] Throughput is calculated for 10s, 60s, and 10min windows at lines 82-97, but if streams just started, some windows will show 'No data' - could attackers exploit this to hide performance degradation by repeatedly creating new short-lived streams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Timestamp manipulation] If SystemTime calculations in get_throughput_from_samples() are affected by clock skew or NTP adjustments, could throughput calculations become wildly inaccurate, masking real performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [Missing audit logging] The status_page() function provides sensitive operational data but has no logging - can attackers probe the status page repeatedly without detection to gather intelligence for planning attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: status_page()] [No rate limiting] There's no rate limiting on status page requests - can an attacker flood the endpoint to cause resource exhaustion through repeated HTML generation and ConnectionManager queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [No data freshness indicator] The displayed data has no timestamp showing when it was captured - if the status page is cached or stale, could operators make decisions based on outdated information during critical incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/status_page.rs] [Function: render_connection_manager_info()] [Unicode handling] If stream IDs or version strings contain Unicode characters, emojis, or right-to-left text at line 71, are they properly encoded in HTML to prevent display corruption or character encoding attacks?
