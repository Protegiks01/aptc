(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/list.rs] [Function: execute(), line 101] [Unwrap panic] The unwrap() call on try_parse_abi() can panic if ABI parsing fails - can a malicious validator publish modules with intentionally malformed ABIs that crash all CLI tools attempting to list modules, causing widespread CLI denial of service?
