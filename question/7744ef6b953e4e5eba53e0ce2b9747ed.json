(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution()] [Race Condition] Does the async background thread spawned at lines 92-101 create race conditions where counters are updated after state commitment, potentially allowing double-counting of transaction metrics and resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the clone operation at line 91 combined with the background spawn at line 92 be exploited to exhaust memory by forcing execution of extremely large blocks before cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution()] [Execution Bypass] When ExecutableTransactions::Sharded is provided, the comment at line 80 states auxiliary info support is incomplete - can this be exploited to execute transactions without proper auxiliary data validation, bypassing sequence number or signature checks?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution()] [Determinism Violation] Can different validators receive different ExecutableTransactions variants (Sharded vs Unsharded) for the same block, causing non-deterministic execution and state root divergence?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution()] [Type Confusion] Is there proper validation that auxiliary_infos length matches transactions length before passing to execution functions, or can mismatched lengths cause out-of-bounds access?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution_unsharded()] [Block Epilogue Injection] At lines 129-146, can an attacker inject multiple BlockEpilogue transactions in the input to execute arbitrary block_epilogue_txn logic multiple times and manipulate validator rewards or stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution_unsharded()] [Auxiliary Info Inconsistency] The logic at lines 132-145 switches between version 0 (None) and version 1 (with transaction_index) behavior - can this version mismatch be exploited to cause auxiliary info desynchronization across validators? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution_unsharded()] [Assertion Bypass] The assertion at line 161 requires block epilogue status to be 'kept' - can Byzantine validators craft execution outputs where block epilogue has Retry or Discard status to bypass reward distribution or epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/do_get_execution_output.rs] [Function: by_transaction_execution_unsharded()] [Integer Overflow] At line 142, transaction_index is calculated as 'transactions.len() as u32 - 1' - can extremely large blocks cause u32 overflow and wrap to 0, breaking auxiliary info indexing? (Medium)",
