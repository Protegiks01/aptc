  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate genesis_file_location to contain path traversal sequences (../../etc/passwd) to load arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially leaking sensitive validator keys or configuration data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [BCS Deserialization Attack] Can a malicious genesis.blob file with crafted BCS-serialized data exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in bcs::from_bytes() to cause memory corruption, stack overflow, or arbitrary code execution on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an extremely large genesis.blob file (multiple GB) that gets fully read into memory via read_to_end(&mut buffer), causing out-of-memory conditions and validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Malicious Genesis Injection] If genesis_file_location points to a symlink created by an attacker, can the symlink target be changed between the exists() check and File::open() call (TOCTOU vulnerability) to load a malicious genesis transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Genesis Validation Bypass] Does load_from_path() validate that the deserialized Transaction is actually a GenesisTransaction variant, or can an attacker inject arbitrary transaction types (UserTransaction, BlockMetadata) as genesis causing consensus corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [State Corruption] If multiple threads concurrently call load_from_path() on the same ExecutionConfig instance, can race conditions lead to partially loaded genesis data or inconsistent self.genesis state across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Error Handling Leak] Do the error messages returned by load_from_path() leak sensitive filesystem paths or internal validator configuration that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Symbolic Link Attack] Can genesis_file_location be a symbolic link to a world-writable file that allows unprivileged users to inject malicious genesis transactions affecting all validators reading from that location? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [BCS Bomb Attack] Can a specially crafted genesis.blob exploit BCS deserialization to trigger exponential memory allocation (billion laughs attack equivalent) causing validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Genesis Integrity] Is there any cryptographic verification (hash, signature) of the genesis file contents before deserialization, or can an attacker replace genesis.blob with arbitrary data without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Path Injection] If self.genesis_file_location is empty and gets set to GENESIS_BLOB_FILENAME, can an attacker manipulate the PathBuf to write to arbitrary locations through path traversal in root_dir.full_path()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Race Condition Write] Can concurrent calls to save_to_path() from multiple threads result in corrupted genesis.blob files or partial writes that make subsequent load_from_path() calls fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [File Overwrite Attack] Does save_to_path() check if the target file already exists and validate its contents, or can it silently overwrite legitimate genesis files with attacker-controlled data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [BCS Serialization Error] If bcs::to_bytes() fails to serialize the genesis transaction but File::create() already truncated the existing file, can this leave validators with an empty or corrupted genesis.blob causing total network failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Atomic Write Failure] Does save_to_path() implement atomic file writes (write to temp, then rename), or can power failures/crashes during write_all() leave partially written genesis files that corrupt validator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Permission Bypass] Can an attacker exploit insufficient file permission checks to write genesis.blob to restricted directories, potentially affecting system-wide validator configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Mainnet Verification Bypass] Can a malicious validator configure ChainId to appear as non-mainnet during initialization, bypass the paranoid_hot_potato_verification requirement, then switch to mainnet operations without these critical security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Type Verification Disable] On mainnet, does sanitize() prevent paranoid_type_verification from being disabled at runtime after initial validation, or can validators dynamically toggle this to skip Move type safety checks during transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Chain ID Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a maliciously crafted ChainId that claims to be mainnet (via is_mainnet()) but isn't actually the real mainnet, bypassing verification requirements while participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [NodeType Bypass] Does sanitize() validate security requirements based on NodeType, or can a malicious node claim to be a PublicFullnode to avoid validator-specific security checks while still participating in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Configuration Hot-Reload] If ExecutionConfig can be reloaded at runtime, does sanitize() get called again, or can validators bypass checks by modifying config files after initial startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Testnet Configuration on Mainnet] Can a validator accidentally or maliciously run with testnet ExecutionConfig settings (paranoid checks disabled) on mainnet without detection until vulnerabilities are exploited? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Validation Timing] Is sanitize() called before or after genesis is loaded, and can the ordering allow malicious genesis data to be processed without proper configuration validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Waypoint Injection Attack] Can an attacker exploit the automatic genesis waypoint injection in optimize() by manipulating base.waypoint to a non-genesis version, causing injection of incorrect MAINNET_GENESIS_WAYPOINT or TESTNET_GENESIS_WAYPOINT values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can optimize() be tricked into injecting the wrong genesis waypoint by providing a fake ChainId that incorrectly identifies as mainnet or testnet, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)"
