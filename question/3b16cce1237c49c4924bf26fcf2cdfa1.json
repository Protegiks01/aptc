  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_module_event_to_store()] [Gas metering consistency] Uses same gas formula as V1 events - is this appropriate, or can V2 events be more expensive allowing attackers to underpay for expensive operations? (Medium)",
