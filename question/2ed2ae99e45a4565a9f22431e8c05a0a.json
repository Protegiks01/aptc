  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/property_map.rs] [JSON Structure] The expected JSON structure at lines 33-34 has nested 'map.data' - if an attacker provides alternative JSON structures that partially match, can this cause unexpected parsing behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/property_map.rs] [Performance: String Allocation] Lines 35, 36, 37, 38 perform multiple to_string() conversions per property - can this cause excessive memory allocation if processing millions of properties? (Low)",
