  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Panic propagation] If natives::aptos_natives or natives::configure_for_unit_test panic, is this handled gracefully or does it crash the entire process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Error suppression] If run_extended_checks returns an error, is it properly surfaced or silently ignored leading to false test passes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Partial initialization] If native function registration partially fails, does aptos_debug_natives return a partially initialized table that could cause runtime errors? (High)",
