(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Constant: EMIT_FEE_STATEMENT] [Event emission bypass] Does the VM enforce that EMIT_FEE_STATEMENT is only callable during transaction epilogue, or can attackers call it directly to emit fraudulent fee statements and manipulate on-chain analytics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [All Modules] [Module resolution race] During parallel transaction execution, can race conditions in lazy static initialization cause different threads to resolve the same module name to different ModuleId instances, leading to non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [All Modules] [Core address validation] Does the code validate that account_config::CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (0x1) is consistent across all module definitions, or can address mismatches cause modules to be resolved from untrusted addresses? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [All Constants] [Function name validation] Are function name constants validated against the actual Move framework code at compile time, or can mismatches between constants and deployed modules cause critical function call failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [All Constants] [IdentStr immutability] Does the IdentStr type guarantee immutability of function name constants, or can they be modified at runtime through unsafe code, redirecting system function calls to attacker-controlled functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Integration] [VM initialization timing] Can attackers exploit the timing of lazy static initialization to cause system modules to be resolved before the VM is fully initialized, leading to undefined behavior or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Integration] [Module cache poisoning] If these constants are used to populate the VM's module cache, can attackers poison the cache with malicious modules before legitimate system modules are loaded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Integration] [Function lookup bypass] When the VM uses these constants to look up system functions, are there path traversal or namespace collision vulnerabilities that could redirect calls to attacker-controlled functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Integration] [Error propagation] If lazy static initialization fails for any module, does the VM properly propagate errors and halt execution, or can it continue with null/invalid module references causing crashes or exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Integration] [State consistency] During epoch transitions or reconfigurations, are these module constants re-validated against the new framework version, or can version mismatches cause state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Memory Safety] [Lazy static thread safety] Does the once_cell::sync::Lazy implementation guarantee thread-safe initialization across all architectures, or can weak memory ordering cause some threads to see uninitialized ModuleId instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Memory Safety] [Reference lifetime] Are the static references to ModuleId and IdentStr guaranteed to outlive all VM instances, or can use-after-free occur if the VM attempts to access these constants during shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone semantics] When ModuleId is cloned from these lazy statics, does the clone properly deep-copy all internal data, or can shallow copies lead to shared mutable state and race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/system_module_names.rs] [Concurrency] [Initialization order] If multiple system modules are accessed concurrently during VM startup, can initialization order dependencies cause deadlocks or inconsistent module resolution? (Medium)",
