  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_registered_networks()] [Network enumeration] Can attackers enumerate registered networks through get_registered_networks() to gain information about network topology and target specific network partitions? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error information leakage] Do error messages in Error::NetworkError, Error::RpcError, and Error::UnexpectedError expose sensitive internal state that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Error conversion] [Loss of error context] When converting from anyhow::Error, NetworkError, or RpcError to Error enum, is critical error context preserved, or can loss of detail hide security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Multiple functions] [ArcSwap race conditions] Can rapid updates to cached_peers_and_metadata via ArcSwap.store() cause readers to observe inconsistent snapshots where some peer updates are visible but others aren't? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Mutex deadlock] Can the subscribers Mutex in broadcast() deadlock if a subscriber's try_send() callback somehow acquires other locks that are held by callers of broadcast()? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: subscribe()] [Double lock] Does subscribe() properly handle the case where it holds both peers_and_metadata read lock and subscribers Mutex - can this cause deadlock with broadcast()? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: group_peers_by_protocol()] [Iterator invalidation] When group_peers_by_protocol() iterates over peers and calls get_preferred_protocol_for_peer(), can concurrent metadata updates invalidate the iteration causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [chunk_by consistency] The chunk_by() call groups peers by network_id - if peer.network_id() changes during iteration (due to concurrent updates), can this cause incorrect grouping? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_preferred_protocol_for_peer()] [Protocol rollback] Can an attacker force protocol rollback by temporarily disconnecting and reconnecting with only old protocol support, bypassing security improvements in newer protocols? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Function: supports_any_protocol()] [Protocol intersection attack] Can an attacker exploit the intersect() logic by advertising minimal protocol overlap to force use of a least-capable protocol variant? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Handshake replay] Can an attacker replay old connection_metadata from a previous session to bypass authentication or re-establish a connection with stale security parameters? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Message amplification] If send_to_peers() is called with a large peer list, can this cause memory exhaustion from cloning the message for each peer, enabling DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization DoS] Can extremely large messages or complex message structures in to_bytes_by_protocol() cause excessive CPU/memory usage during protocol-specific serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Event storm] If thousands of peers connect/disconnect rapidly, can the flood of NewPeer/LostPeer events overwhelm subscriber channels causing systematic message loss? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Quadratic complexity] If sort_peers_by_latency() is called on large peer lists (>1000 peers) frequently, can the O(n log n) sorting complexity cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: update_connection_state()] [Missing state machine] Does update_connection_state() enforce a proper state machine (Connected -> Disconnecting -> Disconnected), or can arbitrary state jumps corrupt the connection lifecycle? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: remove_peer_metadata()] [Incomplete cleanup] When remove_peer_metadata() is called, does it clean up all associated state including pending RPCs, queued messages, and cached data, or can stale state linger? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Duplicate connection handling] If a peer connects multiple times concurrently (e.g., bidirectional connections), does insert_connection_metadata() handle this correctly or can it corrupt metadata? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [NetworkSender lifetime] If NetworkSenders in the HashMap are dropped or become invalid, does NetworkClient detect this before attempting sends, or can stale senders cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Timeout enforcement] Is the rpc_timeout strictly enforced, or can slow/malicious peers delay responses indefinitely causing the caller to block despite the timeout? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Response validation] Does send_to_peer_rpc() validate that the response actually comes from the intended peer, or can peer ID spoofing allow MITM attacks on RPC responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc_raw()] [Raw RPC deserialization] When send_to_peer_rpc_raw() receives raw bytes as response, is deserialization done safely with bounds checking, or can malformed responses trigger memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Concurrent RPC limit] Is there a limit on concurrent RPCs per peer, or can an attacker flood a peer with RPC requests causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [Network boundary enforcement] Does NetworkClient enforce that messages can only be sent within the same network_id, or can cross-network message delivery violate isolation boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: new()] [Network ID validation] Are network_ids validated to prevent special values or duplicates that could break network isolation guarantees? (Medium)"
