  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Function: contains()] [Type Safety] Can contains() be called with a value of type T that was constructed without proper validation, bypassing compiler safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Generic: TName] [Trait Bounds] Are the trait bounds TName: Eq + Ord + Clone sufficient, or could custom TName implementations violate invariants expected by UniqueSet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Generic: TName::Key] [Ordering Consistency] If TName::Key's Ord implementation is inconsistent with Eq, can this cause BTreeMap corruption leading to incorrect set behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Generic: TName::Loc] [Location Copy] Does the Copy bound on TName::Loc guarantee safe copying, or could types like raw pointers disguised as Copy cause memory safety issues? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Generic: TName] [borrow() Lifetime] Can TName::borrow() return references with incorrect lifetimes, causing use-after-free when the borrowed data is accessed? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Compiler Impact] [Resource Safety] If UniqueSet tracks resource types, can failures in add() or contains() allow duplicate resource definitions that violate Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Compiler Impact] [Module Verification] Can incorrect set operations during module verification allow malicious modules to pass compilation with duplicate function or struct names? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Compiler Impact] [Bytecode Generation] Could bugs in UniqueSet cause the compiler to generate incorrect bytecode where duplicates are silently ignored, creating exploitable on-chain contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Compiler Impact] [Error Reporting] Can incorrect location tracking from get_loc() or get_loc_() cause the compiler to report errors at wrong source locations, confusing developers and hiding real bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Compiler Impact] [Import Resolution] If UniqueSet tracks imported modules, can bugs allow circular imports or duplicate imports that cause non-terminating compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/unique_set.rs] [Concurrency] [Thread Safety] Is UniqueSet Send/Sync safe for parallel compilation, or could concurrent access to shared UniqueSet instances cause data races? (High)",
