  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious JSON/YAML configuration with deeply nested or recursive structures that exploit serde's deny_unknown_fields to cause stack overflow or excessive memory allocation during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Type confusion] Does the serde tag attribute properly validate that the 'type' field matches expected checker names, or can an attacker supply an ambiguous type string that gets deserialized into an unexpected checker variant causing type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker inject malicious configuration values through environment variables or external config files that bypass deny_unknown_fields validation and inject unexpected checker types into the CheckerConfig enum? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Deserialization DoS] Can an attacker provide a configuration with an extremely large number of checker instances (e.g., thousands of CheckerConfig variants) that causes resource exhaustion during deserialization or checker construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Schema validation bypass] Does deny_unknown_fields properly reject configurations with extra fields at all nesting levels, or can an attacker inject malicious fields in nested structures within individual checker configs that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Error handling] Does try_into_boxed_checker() properly sanitize error messages from individual checker constructors, or can malicious checker configs cause the function to leak sensitive system information through error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Panic safety] Can any of the checker constructors (BuildVersionChecker::new, ConsensusProposalsChecker::new, etc.) panic with malicious config values, causing try_into_boxed_checker to panic and potentially crash the node checker service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the TpsChecker::new(config)? call at line 72 properly validate TPS checker config limits, or can an attacker specify extreme values (e.g., checking TPS every nanosecond) that cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Memory safety] When boxing checker instances, are there any scenarios where the Box<dyn Checker> could be deallocated prematurely or double-freed if error handling is triggered during construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Type safety] Does the trait object coercion to Box<dyn Checker> properly enforce all safety requirements of the Checker trait, or can malformed checker implementations violate trait safety guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: try_into_boxed_checker()] [Error propagation] The TpsChecker is the only checker that returns Result from new() - does this asymmetry in error handling create edge cases where errors are silently ignored for other checkers that panic instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Partial failure] If build_checkers() fails midway through processing checker_configs due to one invalid config, does it properly clean up already-constructed checkers, or could there be resource leaks from partially-initialized checker instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Clone vulnerability] The function calls config.clone().try_into_boxed_checker() - can the clone operation on CheckerConfig be exploited to cause deep copy issues, resource exhaustion, or double-free vulnerabilities with certain checker configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Order dependency] Does the order of checkers in checker_configs matter for security, and can an attacker reorder checkers to cause earlier checkers to mask critical failures that later checkers would detect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Collect DoS] The collect() call accumulates all results - can an attacker provide a configuration with thousands of checkers causing memory exhaustion during the collection phase before any validation occurs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Error aggregation] When multiple checker configs fail to construct, does anyhow::Error properly aggregate all failures, or could early errors be silently dropped making it harder to diagnose configuration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Race condition] If build_checkers() is called concurrently from multiple threads with the same checker_configs slice, can race conditions in checker construction cause undefined behavior or data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Required field bypass] The 'required' field defaults to false - can an attacker intentionally omit this field in critical checker configurations to bypass mandatory health checks and make malicious nodes appear healthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Default override] Does the #[serde(default)] attribute on the required field allow an attacker to reset critical security checks to non-required by exploiting serde's default handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Deny unknown fields] The deny_unknown_fields attribute is applied - but does it properly cascade to nested structures, or can attackers inject malicious fields at deeper nesting levels within CommonCheckerConfig? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Boolean manipulation] Can the boolean 'required' field be manipulated through type confusion attacks (e.g., passing",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Variant exhaustion] The enum has 12 checker variants - can an attacker exploit pattern matching exhaustiveness by adding new checker types through configuration manipulation causing unhandled variants? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Memory layout] When CheckerConfig enum variants have significantly different sizes, can an attacker exploit memory layout differences to cause buffer overflows or memory corruption during enum operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Consensus checker priority] ConsensusProposals, ConsensusRound, and ConsensusTimeouts checkers are critical for validator health - can an attacker disable these specific checkers while leaving others enabled to hide consensus failures?
