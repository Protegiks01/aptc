  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_key_pair()] [Cryptographic vulnerability] Can a malicious validator exploit weak randomness in the RNG parameter to predict or manipulate the generated AugmentedSecretKeyShare and AugmentedPubKeyShare, allowing them to forge proofs or predict VUF outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_key_pair()] [Key reuse attack] Does the implementation prevent reuse of the same SecretKeyShare with different random values to generate multiple conflicting AugmentedSecretKeyShares, potentially enabling a validator to produce multiple valid proofs for different evaluations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_key_pair()] [Parameter validation] Are PublicParameters validated before being used in key augmentation, or can a malicious actor provide crafted parameters that weaken the cryptographic security of the augmented keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_key_pair()] [Input validation] Is there verification that the provided PubKeyShare actually corresponds to the SecretKeyShare before augmentation, or can an attacker supply mismatched keys to create invalid augmented key pairs that break consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_key_pair()] [Side-channel attack] Does the key augmentation process execute in constant time regardless of the secret key value, or can timing analysis reveal information about the SecretKeyShare enabling key recovery?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [Delta forgery] Can an attacker forge a Delta value that when combined with a legitimate PubKeyShare via augment_pubkey() creates an AugmentedPubKeyShare that appears valid but allows manipulation of proof verification or evaluation derivation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [Error handling bypass] Does augment_pubkey() return anyhow::Result with proper validation, or can edge case inputs cause it to return Ok() with an invalid AugmentedPubKeyShare that breaks downstream verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [PublicParameters mismatch] Can different validators use different PublicParameters when calling augment_pubkey(), leading to inconsistent AugmentedPubKeyShares across the network and causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Type: Delta] [Clone trait abuse] Since Delta implements Clone, can a malicious implementation create non-deterministic clones that produce different values when cloned, breaking the invariant that cloned deltas should be identical? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: create_share()] [Determinism violation] Does create_share() produce deterministic ProofShares for the same AugmentedSecretKeyShare and message, or can non-determinism allow a validator to create multiple different valid proof shares causing aggregation failures?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Verification bypass] Can a malicious validator craft a ProofShare that passes verify_share() checks but contains invalid cryptographic data that causes failures during aggregate_shares() or derive_eval()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Parameter consistency] Does verify_share() ensure the PublicParameters match those used in augment_key_pair(), or can parameter inconsistency allow proof verification to pass with mismatched cryptographic contexts?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Error type confusion] Does verify_share() properly distinguish between different error types (invalid signature vs malformed input vs parameter mismatch), or can ambiguous errors be exploited to hide attack attempts?
