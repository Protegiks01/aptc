  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch spoofing] Can a Byzantine validator forge the metadata.epoch field in DKGTranscript to make a transcript appear to belong to a different epoch, bypassing epoch-based access controls and validator set checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Sybil amplification] Can a Byzantine validator create multiple DKGTranscriptRequest messages with the same dealer_epoch from different peer IDs to amplify their influence in the DKG protocol and collect more transcript shares than entitled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Selective response withholding] Can Byzantine validators selectively respond to DKGTranscriptRequest messages based on requester identity, causing honest validators to have incomplete transcript sets and fail DKG aggregation, leading to loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Reliable broadcast assumptions] Does the RBMessage trait implementation for DKGMessage enforce any message ordering, delivery guarantees, or Byzantine fault tolerance properties, or can the reliable broadcast layer be exploited to deliver messages out-of-order or to subset of validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Broadcast amplification] Can a malicious validator exploit the RBMessage broadcast semantics to amplify a single DKGTranscriptRequest into network-wide storms, causing bandwidth exhaustion and preventing legitimate DKG message delivery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Message authentication] Does the RBMessage trait require cryptographic signatures on DKGMessage instances, or can unauthenticated messages be broadcasted, allowing man-in-the-middle attackers to inject, modify, or drop DKG messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Trait: RBMessage] [Equivocation detection] Does the reliable broadcast layer detect when a validator sends conflicting DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse messages with different transcript_bytes for the same epoch, or can Byzantine validators equivocate without penalty? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch boundary races] During epoch transitions, can race conditions occur where validators process DKGMessage from epoch N with state from epoch N+1, causing transcript verification failures or acceptance of invalid transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Stale epoch requests] When a validator receives DKGTranscriptRequest with dealer_epoch older than current epoch, is it safely rejected, or can processing stale requests cause the validator to enter incorrect DKG states or waste resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Epoch drift tolerance] If validators have slightly different views of current epoch due to network delays, can this cause legitimate DKGMessage instances to be rejected as having wrong epochs, leading to DKG protocol stalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch synchronization] Does the epoch() method guarantee that all validators agree on epoch boundaries at the same logical time, or can Byzantine validators exploit epoch desynchronization to partition the network or cause state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Transcript authenticity] Does DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse validate that the enclosed DKGTranscript was actually generated by the claimed author (metadata.author), or can a validator forge transcripts claiming to be from other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Transcript completeness] Can a Byzantine validator send DKGTranscriptResponse with incomplete or corrupted transcript_bytes that pass initial validation but fail during cryptographic verification, causing validators to waste resources on invalid data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Metadata-transcript consistency] Is there validation that DKGTranscript.metadata.epoch matches the epoch context of the enclosing DKGMessage, or can epoch mismatches between message envelope and transcript payload cause security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Transcript aggregation safety] When multiple TranscriptResponse messages are aggregated, is there protection against Byzantine validators contributing multiple transcripts under different identities, potentially corrupting the aggregated DKG output? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Author verification bypass] Can a malicious validator set metadata.author to a high-stake validator's address to make their malicious transcript appear more trustworthy, bypassing weight-based aggregation security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Concurrent request handling] If multiple threads handle DKGTranscriptRequest messages concurrently for the same epoch, can race conditions occur in request deduplication or response generation, causing double-spending of computational resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Message processing atomicity] When processing sequences of DKGMessage instances (request followed by responses), are state transitions atomic, or can interleaved messages from Byzantine validators cause inconsistent DKG state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch read consistency] Is the epoch() method called under appropriate locks/synchronization, or can TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) races occur where epoch changes between validation and processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone safety] Does cloning DKGMessage instances (including TranscriptResponse with large transcript_bytes) properly handle memory allocation failures, or can memory pressure during clone operations cause panics in consensus-critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone amplification attacks] Can Byzantine validators trigger excessive cloning of DKGMessage instances containing large DKGTranscript payloads, causing memory exhaustion attacks on honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Memory layout predictability] Does the deterministic memory layout of DKGTranscriptRequest allow side-channel attacks where attackers infer epoch values from cache timing or memory access patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Does the PartialEq implementation for DKGTranscriptRequest use constant-time comparison, or can timing side channels leak information about dealer_epoch values during message deduplication? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Hash-equality mismatch] Is it possible for two DKGMessage instances to have equal CryptoHasher hashes but fail PartialEq comparison (or vice versa), causing inconsistencies in hash-based message tracking versus equality-based deduplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Transcript comparison performance] When comparing DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse instances with large transcript_bytes, can the O(n) comparison time be exploited for DoS by sending maximally-sized transcripts that differ only in the last byte?
