  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Cryptography: APK augmentation] [Augmentation security] WVUF::augment_pubkey() on line 657 combines pk_share and delta - can attackers craft deltas that cancel out parts of the public key, weakening cryptographic security? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Cryptography: Hash function] [SHA3-256 usage] Line 146 uses SHA3-256 for final randomness derivation - is the input domain properly separated to prevent length extension attacks on the VUF output? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Cryptography: Aggregate signatures] [Rogue key attacks] verify_multi_signatures() on line 556 validates aggregate signatures - does the implementation prevent rogue key attacks where attackers choose keys to cancel honest validators' contributions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Serialization: BCS usage] [Determinism] Multiple functions use bcs::to_bytes() (lines 68, 91, 131, 144) - are all serialized types guaranteed deterministic across Rust versions to prevent consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Serialization: Type confusion] [Derive Serialize] All types derive Serialize/Deserialize - can type confusion during deserialization cause MockShare to be accepted where Share is expected, bypassing verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Deserialization: Resource exhaustion] [DoS vectors] Can attackers craft malicious serialized RandShare or AugData with deeply nested structures that cause deserialization to exhaust stack or heap memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Error handling: expect() usage] [Panic vectors] Lines 159, 165, 187, 192, 635 use expect() which panics on error - can Byzantine validators trigger these panics by sending invalid data, crashing honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Error handling: Result propagation] [Error information leak] Functions return anyhow::Result with detailed error messages - could error messages leak sensitive cryptographic information to attackers probing for vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Error handling: bail! macro] [Early returns] Line 74 uses bail! to return early - can this bypass cleanup code that should run, leaving RandConfig in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Input validation: Author validation] [Missing checks] Multiple functions accept Author parameters without validating they're in the current validator set - can attackers provide arbitrary addresses to cause index out-of-bounds? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Input validation: Epoch validation] [Cross-epoch attacks] Functions don't validate epoch matches current consensus epoch - can attackers replay shares/augdata from past epochs to corrupt current randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Input validation: Round validation] [Future rounds] No validation prevents accepting shares for rounds far in the future beyond FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT - can attackers pre-generate shares for future rounds to bias randomness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Input validation: Metadata validation] [Field constraints] RandMetadata fields (epoch, round) are not validated for reasonable ranges - can integer overflow in these fields cause arithmetic errors in downstream code? (Medium)"
