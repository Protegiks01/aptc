  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: DerivedStringSnapshotResource] [String validation] Is the value String validated for proper UTF-8 encoding, or can malformed strings cause panics or security issues during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: DerivedStringSnapshotResource] [Private field access] While value is private, can Rust's unsafe code or serialization bypass access controls to inject malicious string data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: DerivedStringSnapshotResource] [Padding content] Can the padding field contain executable code, malicious scripts, or data that gets interpreted unsafely elsewhere in the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: DerivedStringSnapshotResource] [Storage bloat] Can repeated creation of DerivedStringSnapshotResource with large padding vectors bloat blockchain state and degrade performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::new()] [No deprecation enforcement] Despite being marked deprecated, new() still allows creation - can this lead to using outdated security-vulnerable code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::new()] [Limit validation missing] The u128 limit is not validated against any constraints - can limit be set to 0, causing division-by-zero or other arithmetic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::new()] [Handle collision] Can attackers create multiple AggregatorV1Resources with the same handle but different keys, causing state collision or confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::new()] [Key generation weakness] Are handle and key AccountAddresses securely generated, or can predictable values lead to aggregator impersonation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::state_key()] [State key collision] Can the StateKey generation logic produce collisions when multiple aggregators use the same handle, allowing one aggregator to overwrite another's state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::state_key()] [Table handle validation] Is TableHandle(self.handle) validated to ensure it corresponds to a valid table, or can invalid handles cause storage corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorV1Resource::state_key()] [Key reference safety] Does self.key.as_ref() provide sufficient safety guarantees, or can it reference invalid memory in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorV1Resource] [Backward compatibility] Since this is deprecated, can migration from V1 to V2 aggregators lose data or create inconsistencies in live token supplies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorV1Resource] [Dual writes] If both V1 and V2 aggregators coexist, can concurrent modifications create split-brain scenarios where different validators see different states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: IntegerResource] [Public value field] The value field is public - can direct field access bypass limit checks that should be enforced through methods? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: IntegerResource] [Limit enforcement] With both value and limit as u128, is there any code enforcing value <= limit, or can this invariant be violated through serialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: IntegerResource] [Integer overflow] Can arithmetic operations on the public value field cause overflow/underflow without proper checks, leading to fund creation or loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: IntegerResource] [No methods] Without any accessor or modifier methods, how is this struct safely manipulated, and can direct field access create vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: IntegerResource] [Serialization attack] Can malicious deserializers create IntegerResource with value > limit, breaking system invariants for non-parallelizable aggregators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: OptionalAggregatorV1Resource] [Both fields Some] Can both aggregator and integer be Some simultaneously, creating ambiguous state about which value is authoritative? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: OptionalAggregatorV1Resource] [Both fields None] Can both fields be None, creating a valid but semantically meaningless OptionalAggregatorV1Resource that breaks caller assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: OptionalAggregatorV1Resource] [Public fields] Both aggregator and integer are public - can direct manipulation create inconsistent states during runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: OptionalAggregatorV1Resource] [Type confusion] Can callers incorrectly handle the Option types, leading to panics from unwrap() or incorrect None handling causing logic errors? (Medium)",
