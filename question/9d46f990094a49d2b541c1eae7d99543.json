  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Missing zero-knowledge proof] There's no zero-knowledge proof that dealer knows the discrete log - can dealers commit to random values they don't know, breaking DKG security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Unused encryption keys] The eks parameter is passed but never validated - are the encryption keys supposed to be verified against a known validator set, and does skipping this allow unauthorized parties to participate in DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Array length checks] Lines 121-135 check array lengths but can these be bypassed if arrays are constructed with correct lengths but malicious content that passes length checks but breaks cryptographic properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Take vs full array] Line 147 uses self.V.iter().take(sc.n) instead of full array - can the last element V[n] (public key) be maliciously set without detection since it's not included in verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Scalar zero attack] If C contains zero scalars, will the linear combination still pass verification, and can this be exploited to create weak key shares that compromise the distributed key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Point at infinity] If V contains the point at infinity, will multi_exp_iter handle it correctly, or can this cause verification to pass incorrectly or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Alpha zero edge case] Can all random alphas be zero (extremely unlikely but possible), causing lc_1 and lc_2 to both be zero and verification to pass for any transcript? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [Integer overflow in summation] Line 144 sums c * alpha products - can carefully crafted scalars cause overflow in the Scalar field, wrapping around and allowing verification bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: verify()] [No dealer validation] verify() never checks that dealers list is valid, non-empty, or authorized - can transcripts with empty or unauthorized dealers pass verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [No bounds checking] Line 165 directly indexes V[player.id] without checking if player.id < V.len() - can out-of-bounds player IDs cause panics or memory corruption during key share retrieval? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Unused threshold config] The sc parameter is received but never used - should threshold validation occur here, and does skipping it allow retrieval of invalid key shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Wrong player share] If player.id is manipulated or doesn't match the intended validator, can an attacker retrieve another validator's public key share and impersonate them in consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Unverified transcript] This function can be called on unverified transcripts - can attackers retrieve public key shares from forged transcripts before verification, gaining unauthorized access to cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_dealt_public_key()] [Unwrap panic] Line 169 uses unwrap() on V.last() - can empty V arrays cause panics during critical DKG operations, halting validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_dealt_public_key()] [Wrong index assumption] This assumes V[n] is the public key but verify() only checks V[0..n] - can V[n] be maliciously modified to provide wrong public key for the distributed key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: get_dealt_public_key()] [Unverified access] Like get_public_key_share(), this can return unverified public keys - can attackers use forged public keys in signature aggregation or consensus voting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [No actual decryption] Line 179 directly returns C[player.id] without using the decryption key _dk - does this mean shares are stored in plaintext, exposing secret key material to network observers and violating PVSS security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [No bounds checking] Direct indexing of C[player.id] without validation - can malicious player IDs cause out-of-bounds access, panics, or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Wrong player attack] If player.id is manipulated, can a Byzantine validator decrypt and retrieve another validator's secret key share, breaking the threshold security model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Unused decryption key] The _dk parameter is never used - is the DecryptPrivKey mechanism completely bypassed, and does this violate the PVSS protocol's confidentiality guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Unused public parameters] The _pp parameter is ignored - should cryptographic validation using public parameters occur during decryption, and does skipping it allow retrieval of invalid shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [No proof of decryption] There's no zero-knowledge proof that decryption was performed correctly - can validators claim incorrect shares were decrypted, causing key reconstruction failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Replay across transcripts] Can a validator call decrypt_own_share() on multiple aggregated transcripts and use inconsistent shares, breaking DKG consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [Random transcript generation] This generates completely random transcripts - is this only for testing, or could it be called in production to bypass proper DKG, creating insecure keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [insecure_random_g2_points] Line 193 uses insecure_random_g2_points() - does this function have known weaknesses that make generated transcripts predictable or reconstructible? (Critical)"
