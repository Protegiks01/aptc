  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Validation] At line 79, are Move address values validated to ensure they follow the correct hexadecimal format (0x followed by hex digits)? Can an attacker inject invalid addresses like '0xGGGG' or addresses with SQL injection attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Constants: MOVE_STDLIB_ADDR_VALUE] [Address Squatting] The hardcoded address '0x1' at line 19 is the standard library address. Can an attacker create packages with custom address mappings that shadow this address, causing developers to unknowingly use malicious implementations of standard library functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Injection] Can an attacker provide `addrs` parameter with malformed Display implementations that inject TOML syntax through address values, potentially overriding critical address mappings in the manifest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Length] Are extremely long address values (e.g., 0x followed by thousands of hex digits) rejected, or can they cause buffer overflows or excessive memory consumption when the manifest is parsed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Address Collision] Can an attacker provide multiple address mappings with the same name but different values in the `addrs` iterator, causing ambiguity or allowing the last value to override earlier secure values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Special Addresses] Are reserved or system addresses (like 0x0, 0x1, or other framework addresses) blocked from being overridden in the address mapping, or can an attacker remap critical system addresses to malicious modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Unicode Normalization] Can an attacker use Unicode normalization tricks in the `name` parameter (e.g., visually identical but different codepoints) to create packages that appear legitimate but have different names, enabling homograph attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Unicode Path Issues] Can Unicode characters in the `name` or `path` parameter cause filesystem encoding issues on different operating systems, potentially leading to file creation in unexpected locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Right-to-Left Override] Can an attacker use Unicode right-to-left override characters (U+202E) in package names to create misleading package names that appear legitimate in directory listings but are actually malicious? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Zero-Width Characters] Can zero-width Unicode characters in the `name` parameter cause packages to appear to have the same name as legitimate packages but actually be different, enabling typosquatting attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [UTF-8 Validation] Are all string inputs properly validated as valid UTF-8 before being written to the manifest file, or can invalid UTF-8 sequences corrupt the TOML file or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Control Characters] Can control characters (null bytes, line feeds, carriage returns) in the `name` parameter break TOML parsing or cause unexpected behavior in terminal displays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Version Injection] Can the `version` parameter at line 44 be exploited to inject malicious version strings that break semantic versioning parsers or inject TOML syntax through version values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute_with_defaults()] [Fixed Version] The hardcoded version '0.0.0' at line 34 creates all new packages with version 0.0.0. Can this cause confusion in dependency resolution or allow attackers to publish malicious packages with version conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Version Format] Are version strings validated to follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z), or can arbitrary strings like 'malicious\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Propagation] The use of `?` operator throughout the function (lines 59, 60, 68, 70, 77, 79, 82) propagates errors from anyhow::Result. Do these errors leak sensitive filesystem information (paths, permissions) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic Safety] If any of the writeln! macro calls at lines 61-82 panic due to formatting errors or I/O issues, is the partially written Move.toml file left in an inconsistent state that could cause security issues when parsed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Information] Do error messages from `create_dir_all` or `File::create` reveal the absolute paths of attempted file operations, potentially disclosing information about the user's filesystem structure to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Atomic Operations] If writing the manifest file fails partway through (e.g., disk full, permission denied), is the partially written file atomically cleaned up, or does it remain in an invalid state that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Concurrent Creation] If multiple instances of `move new` are run concurrently for the same package name/path, can race conditions in directory/file creation lead to corrupted manifests or mixed content from different invocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Locking] Does the `File::create` at line 60 acquire an exclusive lock on Move.toml, or can concurrent writes from multiple processes interleave and corrupt the file contents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Directory Race] Between checking if a directory exists and creating it, can another process delete the directory, causing `create_dir_all` to fail or behave unexpectedly in a security-relevant way? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Struct: New] [Name Validation] The `name` field at line 27 accepts any String without validation. Can empty strings, strings with only whitespace, or strings with special filesystem characters (e.g., '/', '\\\\', ':', '*', '?') cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Empty Name] Can a package name of empty string or whitespace-only cause the path to resolve to unexpected locations (e.g., current directory) where Move.toml overwrites existing files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Reserved Names] Are reserved filesystem names (e.g., 'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL' on Windows) rejected, or can they cause filesystem errors or unexpected behavior that could be security-relevant? (Low)"
