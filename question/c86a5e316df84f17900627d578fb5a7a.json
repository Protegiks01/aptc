  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Struct: BuildOptions] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide malicious named_addresses in BuildOptions that override critical system addresses (0x1, 0x3, 0x4), potentially allowing unauthorized access to framework modules or governance functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Struct: BuildOptions] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker specify an extremely large bytecode_version value that causes integer overflow when compared against VERSION_MAX or file format version checks, bypassing version validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: Default::default()] [Security Configuration] Does the default BuildOptions with with_error_map=true potentially leak sensitive error information that could aid attackers in crafting exploits against the Move VM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: move_2()] [Version Confusion] Can calling move_2() with VERSION_DEFAULT alongside latest_stable() language version create a mismatch that allows compilation of incompatible bytecode that crashes validators during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: inferred_bytecode_version()] [Logic Error] Does the bytecode version inference logic properly validate that language_version and bytecode_version are compatible, or can mismatched versions produce invalid bytecode that bypasses VM safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Struct: BuildOptions] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker specify a malicious install_dir path with directory traversal sequences (../) to write compiled modules outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Field: skip_fetch_latest_git_deps] [Supply Chain] When skip_fetch_latest_git_deps=false in production, can an attacker perform dependency confusion attacks by publishing malicious packages with the same names as legitimate dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Field: known_attributes] [Attribute Bypass] Can an attacker add custom attributes to known_attributes that bypass skip_attribute_checks, allowing injection of malicious metadata or compiler directives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Field: experiments] [Unsafe Features] Can enabling experimental compiler features via the experiments field introduce unsafe bytecode patterns or disable critical security checks in production deployments? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: build_model()] [Address Injection] Can additional_named_addresses parameter be exploited to shadow or override legitimate package addresses, causing the model to reference attacker-controlled modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: build_model()] [Version Bypass] Does the bytecode version inference at line 194-198 properly handle None values, or can an attacker force default version selection that bypasses intended version constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: build_model()] [Compatibility Check] Can the compiler_version.check_language_support() at line 224 be bypassed by providing mismatched version combinations that appear valid but produce incompatible bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: build_model()] [Test Mode Bypass] Does setting test_mode=false always properly exclude test-only code, or can test artifacts leak into production builds with dev_mode=true? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: build()] [External Checks Bypass] Does the build() function that calls build_with_external_checks with empty vec![] skip critical security validations that should always run? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: create_build_config()] [Validation Skip] At line 249, can check_versions() failure be silently ignored in error handling paths, allowing incompatible compiler/language versions to proceed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/built_package.rs] [Function: create_build_config()] [Configuration Injection] Can named_addresses be cloned from user input without validation, allowing injection of system addresses that override framework modules? (Critical)",
