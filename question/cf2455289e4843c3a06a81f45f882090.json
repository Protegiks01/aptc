  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 11-21] [Key Material Exposure] When cryptographic keys are passed between modules (ed25519, x25519, multi_ed25519), are they properly zeroized after use to prevent key material from lingering in memory where it could be extracted through memory dumps or side channels? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 15] [HKDF Key Lifetime] Does the hkdf module ensure that derived keys have proper lifetime management and are not accidentally reused across different contexts, which could lead to key compromise through nonce reuse or related-key attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 11-21] [Algorithm Confusion] With multiple cryptographic algorithms exposed (Ed25519, X25519, various hash functions), can attackers exploit algorithm confusion attacks where a public key intended for signing is used for encryption, or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 14] [Hash Downgrade Attack] Can attackers force the system to use a weaker hash function from the hash module by manipulating algorithm selection parameters, enabling collision or preimage attacks on Merkle trees or transaction hashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 37-45] [Constant-Time Arithmetic] The dalek libraries claim to use constant-time arithmetic, but can compiler optimizations (especially with different feature flags like fiat vs u64) introduce timing side channels that leak private key information during signature generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 12] [Ed25519 Timing Attack] Can attackers measure timing differences in Ed25519 signature verification to extract information about validator private keys or predict future signatures, enabling targeted attacks on consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 15] [HKDF Randomness Source] Does the hkdf module use a cryptographically secure randomness source for salt generation, or can predictable entropy lead to deterministic key derivation that allows attackers to pre-compute derived keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 17] [Noise Protocol Nonce Reuse] In the noise module's handshake implementation, can nonce reuse or improper state machine transitions break the protocol's security guarantees and allow decryption of past or future messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 16] [Multi-Sig Memory Exhaustion] Can attackers create extremely large multi-signature structures (approaching the 128-key limit) that consume excessive memory during verification, causing validators to run out of memory and crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 14] [Hash DoS] Can attackers submit transactions containing data structures that require computing Merkle proofs with excessive depth or breadth, causing hash computation to consume excessive CPU and delay block production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 41-63] [Feature Flag Migration] During a network upgrade where validators transition from one arithmetic backend to another (e.g., u64 to fiat), can inconsistencies during the migration window cause consensus failures or allow double-spending attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/lib.rs] [Line: 11] [Compatibility Module Bypass] Can the compat module be exploited during protocol upgrades to force validators to accept deprecated cryptographic formats or algorithms, bypassing security improvements in the upgrade? (High)"
