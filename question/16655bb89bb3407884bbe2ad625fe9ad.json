(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Calling Convention Violation] The documentation states the calling convention requires matching type signatures except for an extra dispatch argument - can violating this convention in paranoid mode be exploited to bypass security checks?
