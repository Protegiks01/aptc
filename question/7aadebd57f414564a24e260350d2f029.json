  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/locals_safety/mod.rs] [Function: execute_inner()] [Closure Support] PackClosure and CallClosure instructions (lines 134-136) have no validation - can closures capture locals in unsafe ways? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/locals_safety/mod.rs] [Function: execute_inner()] [Variant Types] The variant bytecodes (PackVariant, UnpackVariant, TestVariant, etc., lines 128-133, 103-106) - can enum/variant operations bypass local safety through pattern matching? (Medium)",
