  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: new()] [String allocation DoS] Can the new() constructor be called with extremely large String parameters to cause excessive heap allocations, leading to memory exhaustion in systems that process many CreateCollection events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Clone performance] The struct doesn't derive Clone - could this cause performance issues if indexer code needs to clone events for parallel processing, or does it prevent necessary data sharing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Indexer crash] In event_v2_translator.rs line 794, if try_from_bytes() fails during event translation, can this cause the indexer to skip events without logging, leading to missing collection data in the API? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Integration: event_v2_translator] [Resource lookup failure] If the Collections resource is not found during event translation (lines 806-810), the error is propagated - can attackers emit events for non-existent collections to cause indexer processing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter: creator()] [State query vulnerability] The creator() method is used to query the Collections resource - can this be exploited if the creator address in the event doesn't match the actual resource owner, causing incorrect sequence number assignment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Duplicate event handling] Can multiple CreateCollection events be emitted for the same collection (bypassing Move uniqueness checks) causing indexer state corruption with duplicate collection records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Serde derive] [Serialization format] The struct derives Serialize/Deserialize but try_from_bytes uses BCS explicitly - can using different serialization formats (JSON vs BCS) cause data corruption or field mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling] The function converts bcs::Error to anyhow::Error using Into::into - can this lose critical error context needed to diagnose malicious vs accidental deserialization failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Field visibility] All fields are private with public getters - could this prevent necessary validation in external code that needs to construct or modify events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [On-chain state mismatch] Can events be emitted with collection_name or maximum values that don't match the actual CollectionData stored on-chain, causing indexer state to diverge from blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: collection_name] [Uniqueness violation] The event doesn't enforce collection_name uniqueness - can multiple events be indexed with identical creator+collection_name pairs if Move contract validation is bypassed through re-entrancy or upgrade bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Temporal ordering] Events lack timestamps - can out-of-order event processing in the indexer cause collections to appear created in wrong chronological order, breaking time-based queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct fields vs Move contract] [Description field validation] The Move contract doesn't validate description length - can extremely long descriptions cause database storage issues or query performance degradation in indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Event emission logic] [Module migration] The Move contract emits different event types based on std::features::module_event_migration_enabled() - can this flag change mid-transaction causing inconsistent event types for the same collection creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Mutability tracking] The event doesn't include CollectionMutabilityConfig - can indexers incorrectly allow collection mutations if they rely solely on events without querying on-chain mutability settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: uri] [URI scheme validation] The uri field accepts any string - can attackers use javascript:, data:, or other dangerous URI schemes in NFT metadata that indexer APIs expose without sanitization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [String fields] [Encoding inconsistency] Are the string fields guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 after BCS deserialization, or can malformed encodings cause display issues or XSS vulnerabilities in web interfaces consuming this data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: creator] [Address format] The creator field is AccountAddress - can non-standard address formats or checksums cause mismatches when querying collections by creator in indexer GraphQL APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial deserialization] If BCS deserialization partially succeeds before failing, can this leave the CreateCollection struct in an inconsistent state with some fields populated and others default-initialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Poison data] Can repeatedly failing to deserialize certain events cause the indexer to blacklist or skip processing valid subsequent CreateCollection events from the same creator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter: collection_name()] [Query injection] The collection_name() getter returns &String - can this be used unsafely in SQL/GraphQL queries without proper escaping, enabling injection attacks in indexer APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter: description()] [XSS vulnerability] The description() getter returns unvalidated user input - can malicious HTML/JavaScript in descriptions cause XSS when displayed in web interfaces consuming indexer data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Information disclosure] Can the event expose sensitive information if collections are created with private/confidential data in description or uri fields that should not be publicly indexed? (Low)"
