  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectEpoch] [Epoch manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator craft proposals with manipulated epoch values that trigger IncorrectEpoch but allow the malicious proposal to be cached or partially processed before rejection, potentially causing epoch confusion across validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectEpoch] [Integer overflow] Does the IncorrectEpoch error properly handle edge cases where provided epoch u64 wraps around (e.g., u64::MAX + 1), potentially allowing an attacker to bypass epoch validation by exploiting integer overflow in epoch comparison logic? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectEpoch] [Race condition] Can concurrent epoch transitions create race conditions where IncorrectEpoch is checked against a stale expected epoch value, allowing proposals from the wrong epoch to be accepted during epoch boundary transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectEpoch] [Information leakage] Does the IncorrectEpoch error message expose sensitive internal state (expected epoch) that could help an attacker determine validator synchronization status or identify validators lagging behind the network? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectEpoch] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker flood validators with proposals containing intentionally incorrect epochs to trigger excessive IncorrectEpoch errors, overwhelming error logging systems or triggering expensive error handling paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectRound] [Round wraparound] The error message states 'block has next round that wraps around' - can an attacker exploit u64 round number wraparound (at u64::MAX) to bypass round progression validation, potentially creating proposals with invalid round numbers that break consensus ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectRound] [Safety violation] If IncorrectRound only checks for wraparound but not for backward round progression, can a Byzantine validator propose blocks with decreasing round numbers to violate the monotonic round progression invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectRound] [Edge case] Does IncorrectRound validation handle the boundary case where current round is u64::MAX - 1 and next round is 0 (legitimate wraparound), or would this be incorrectly flagged as an attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectRound] [Time manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate system time or exploit time synchronization issues to cause legitimate rounds to be flagged as IncorrectRound, leading to liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectLastVotedRound] [Double voting] Does IncorrectLastVotedRound properly prevent a validator from voting on round N after already voting on round M where N < M, or can a Byzantine validator exploit gaps in last_voted_round tracking to enable double-voting attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectLastVotedRound] [Persistent state corruption] If the last_voted_round value in persistent storage is corrupted or rolled back (e.g., via storage layer attack), can IncorrectLastVotedRound checks be bypassed to allow re-voting on already voted rounds, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectLastVotedRound] [Race condition] Can concurrent vote operations on the same validator node create race conditions where last_voted_round is checked before being updated, allowing multiple votes in the same round to pass IncorrectLastVotedRound validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectLastVotedRound] [Validator restart] After validator restart, if last_voted_round is not properly restored from persistent storage, can this cause legitimate votes to be rejected with IncorrectLastVotedRound, leading to liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectLastVotedRound] [Integer comparison] Does IncorrectLastVotedRound handle the case where provided round equals last_voted_round (duplicate vote) vs. less than last_voted_round (backward vote), or could equal rounds slip through validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectPreferredRound] [Preferred block manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate the preferred_round value to force other validators to reject legitimate proposals with IncorrectPreferredRound, causing consensus stalls? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectPreferredRound] [2-chain rule bypass] Does IncorrectPreferredRound properly enforce the 2-chain voting rule, or can attackers craft proposals with manipulated preferred_round values to violate safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: IncorrectPreferredRound] [Quorum certificate forgery] If preferred_round is derived from quorum certificates, can an attacker forge or manipulate QC data to bypass IncorrectPreferredRound validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidAccumulatorExtension] [Merkle tree forgery] Can an attacker craft malicious block proposals with invalid accumulator extensions (non-extending Merkle tree roots) that are initially accepted but fail InvalidAccumulatorExtension checks late, causing state divergence across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidAccumulatorExtension] [String injection] The InvalidAccumulatorExtension error takes a String parameter - can an attacker inject malicious content into error messages that gets logged or displayed, potentially exploiting log injection vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidAccumulatorExtension] [Hash collision] Could a sophisticated attacker exploit hash collisions in the accumulator hash function to create two different block histories that both pass InvalidAccumulatorExtension validation, enabling chain split attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidAccumulatorExtension] [Parent verification bypass] Does InvalidAccumulatorExtension verify that the new tree truly extends the parent tree, or could an attacker provide a valid-looking but non-extending accumulator that bypasses validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidEpochChangeProof] [Epoch change forgery] Can a Byzantine validator forge epoch change proofs that pass initial validation but are flagged with InvalidEpochChangeProof only after partial state transitions, causing validator set confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidEpochChangeProof] [Validator set manipulation] During epoch transitions, can an attacker exploit InvalidEpochChangeProof handling to inject malicious validators into the new epoch's validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidEpochChangeProof] [Reconfiguration bypass] Can attackers craft invalid epoch change proofs that trigger InvalidEpochChangeProof but leave validators in inconsistent epoch states, preventing proper reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/error.rs] [Error Variant: InvalidEpochChangeProof] [Ledger info mismatch] Does InvalidEpochChangeProof validation ensure the epoch change proof matches the ledger info's next_epoch_state, or can mismatches slip through causing state inconsistencies? (Critical)"
