(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_delayed_field_value()] [Clone Cost] The Create variant clones the value at line 143 - can an attacker create extremely large DelayedFieldValue objects that cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion through repeated cloning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Integer Overflow] When BoundedMath performs unsigned_add_delta operations at lines 180-181, can an attacker craft base_delta and delta values that cause overflow even with the max_value bound, potentially allowing unlimited token creation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Delta Merging] The DeltaWithMax::create_merged_delta() call at lines 184-186 merges deltas - can an attacker exploit the merging logic to bypass max_value constraints by splitting operations across multiple transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Type Check Bypass] The function returns code_invariant_error for non-AggregatorDelta Apply changes at line 193 - can an attacker trigger this by mixing aggregator and snapshot operations in ways that bypass earlier type validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [expect_ok Usage] At line 180, expect_ok() is used which can panic - is this panic path deterministic across all validators, or can it cause consensus failures if some validators have different input states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [max_value Validation] The max_value parameter is passed through multiple layers - can an attacker manipulate this value to be inconsistent with the actual aggregator's maximum, allowing them to exceed intended bounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Aggregator Value Conversion] The into_aggregator_value() call at line 180 can fail - if this conversion error is not properly handled deterministically, can it cause validator divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Boolean Result Manipulation] The function returns a boolean indicating if delta addition succeeds - can an attacker exploit cases where this boolean is incorrectly computed to bypass transaction validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome()] [Recursive Base Call] When calling base_executor_view.delayed_field_try_add_delta_outcome() at line 187, can this create a chain of recursive calls if the base view also has change sets, potentially causing stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: generate_delayed_field_id()] [ID Collision] The function delegates to base_executor_view for ID generation - can concurrent transactions generate colliding DelayedFieldIDs, causing one transaction's delayed fields to overwrite another's and leading to state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: generate_delayed_field_id()] [Determinism] Is the ID generation deterministic across all validators, or can differences in execution order or timing cause validators to generate different IDs for the same logical operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: validate_delayed_field_id()] [Validation Bypass] The validation is delegated entirely to base_executor_view - can an attacker craft IDs that pass validation but cause issues later when resolved from the change set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: generate_delayed_field_id()] [Width Parameter] The width parameter controls ID generation - can an attacker provide extreme values (0 or u32::MAX) that cause incorrect ID allocation or overlap with system-reserved IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_reads_needing_exchange()] [Skip Set Bypass] The skip parameter filters resources - can an attacker manipulate the skip set to exclude critical resources from exchange, causing delayed field materialization to miss required dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_reads_needing_exchange()] [Change Set Ignored] The function delegates entirely to base_executor_view without checking the change set - can this cause missed resources that were modified in the change set but need exchange? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_group_reads_needing_exchange()] [Group vs Resource Confusion] Can an attacker cause confusion by having both individual resources and resource groups with the same StateKey, causing get_reads_needing_exchange and get_group_reads_needing_exchange to return conflicting data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_reads_needing_exchange()] [Layout Validation] The returned BTreeMap includes MoveTypeLayout - if these layouts don't match the actual data structure, can it cause deserialization errors during exchange that crash validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_reads_needing_exchange()] [Metadata Consistency] The function returns StateValueMetadata along with data - can metadata become inconsistent with the actual state value if the change set modified the resource but not its metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Layout Mismatch] The maybe_layout parameter is passed to base_executor_view but not validated against the change set's write_op - can this cause layout mismatches where the change set contains data with a different structure than expected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Deletion Handling] When a WriteOp represents a deletion (bytes is None), does as_state_value() return None correctly, or can it return Some(invalid_value) causing resources to appear to exist when they should be deleted?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value()] [Change Set Bypass] The map_or_else pattern falls back to base view when try_get_resource_write_op_from_change_set returns Ok(None) - can InPlaceDelayedFieldChange cause unexpected fallback that reads stale data?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [Metadata Extraction Path] The function has different code paths for Write, WriteWithDelayedFields, WriteResourceGroup, and delayed field changes - can inconsistencies between these paths cause metadata to be extracted incorrectly?
