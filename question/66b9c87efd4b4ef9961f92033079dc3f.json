  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasSchedule::into_btree_map()] [Duplicate entry attack] The TODO comment indicates uncertainty about duplicate entries - can a malicious governance proposal submit a GasSchedule with duplicate gas parameter names where the first entry shows a reasonable value during voting but the last (actually used) entry contains a malicious zero or extreme value, bypassing governance scrutiny and enabling DoS or economic attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasScheduleV2::into_btree_map()] [Duplicate entry attack] Similar to GasSchedule, can an attacker exploit the BTreeMap::from_iter behavior with duplicate keys in GasScheduleV2 entries to hide malicious gas values where the displayed first entry differs from the final applied last entry, causing state inconsistencies across nodes that validate differently? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Validation bypass] Since the entries Vec has no deduplication logic, can an attacker craft a governance proposal with 1000+ duplicate entries for the same gas parameter, where honest validators reviewing the proposal only see the first value, but the runtime system uses the last value after BTreeMap conversion, enabling hidden economic attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasSchedule::into_btree_map()] [State divergence] If different validators process duplicate entries inconsistently (some deduplicate during deserialization, others during into_btree_map), could this cause state root mismatches across nodes, breaking consensus and requiring emergency hard fork intervention? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasScheduleV2::into_btree_map()] [Economic manipulation] Can an attacker insert duplicate entries where the first sets 'storage.per_byte_write' to 1000 gas (appears expensive) but the last duplicate sets it to 0 gas, enabling free state bloat attacks that exhaust validator storage without paying appropriate fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Deserialization attack] During OnChainConfig deserialization, if duplicate keys are present in the serialized data, does the Serde deserializer preserve all duplicates or silently drop some, creating a mismatch between the voted-on proposal hash and the actually applied gas schedule? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasScheduleV2::to_btree_map_borrowed()] [Hidden duplicate] The borrowed conversion also uses collect() which silently handles duplicates - can this be exploited in the diff() function where duplicates in the old schedule might not appear as 'Delete' operations if newer duplicates override them, hiding governance changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleV2] [Race condition] If multiple threads or validators process the same GasScheduleV2 with duplicates concurrently, could non-deterministic BTreeMap ordering from collect() cause different validators to compute different state roots, leading to consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasSchedule::into_btree_map()] [Front-running attack] Can a malicious validator observe a pending gas schedule update with duplicates in mempool, then propose a block that reorders the duplicate entries (if order matters in serialization) to change which duplicate value wins, manipulating gas prices for specific transactions in their block? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Audit bypass] If governance tooling displays only the first occurrence of duplicate entries when showing proposals to voters, but runtime uses the last occurrence after BTreeMap conversion, can attackers systematically hide malicious gas changes in duplicate entries positioned later in the Vec? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: StorageGasSchedule] [DoS attack] The zeros() function creates a StorageGasSchedule with all costs set to 0 - if this is mistakenly applied via governance, could attackers spam the network with free state writes, exhausting validator storage and causing permanent network degradation requiring hard fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Economic attack] There's no validation preventing entries from containing u64::MAX (18.4 quintillion) gas costs - can a governance attack or bug set critical operation gas to u64::MAX, effectively bricking the network by making all transactions impossible to afford? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: StorageGasSchedule] [Validation bypass] The per_item_read, per_item_create, per_item_write, per_byte_read, per_byte_create, and per_byte_write fields have no bounds checking - can setting per_byte_create to 1 while per_byte_write is u64::MAX create asymmetric costs that enable storage griefing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Integer overflow] If a gas entry is set to u64::MAX and the VM attempts to multiply it by transaction size or operation count, could the resulting overflow cause incorrect gas calculations, allowing transactions to execute with insufficient gas payment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: StorageGasSchedule::zeros()] [Misuse vulnerability] If zeros() is accidentally called in production code paths (e.g., during error recovery or testing logic that leaks to production), could it override the real gas schedule with all-zero costs, enabling unlimited free transactions until detected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: StorageGasSchedule] [Economic imbalance] Can an attacker propose a governance change setting per_item_read to 0 but per_byte_read to a high value, or vice versa, creating exploitable gas calculation asymmetries where certain transaction patterns become extremely cheap or expensive? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Negative economic impact] If a malicious or compromised governance proposal sets all gas costs to 1, making transactions nearly free, how would the network handle the resulting transaction flood, and could validators maintain consensus under extreme load until the schedule is reverted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleV2] [Feature version bypass] Can setting feature_version to 0 while maintaining high gas costs cause the VM to fall back to legacy gas calculation code that might have known vulnerabilities or different calculation semantics, enabling gas exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [OnChainConfig Implementation] [Governance takeover] As an OnChainConfig with MODULE_IDENTIFIER 'gas_schedule', this can be modified via governance votes - can an attacker who compromises ~33% of staked voting power propose incremental gas changes that gradually reduce security-critical operation costs to enable future exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleV2] [Version manipulation] The feature_version field has no validation or monotonicity checking - can a malicious proposal roll back feature_version from 10 to 1, potentially reverting security fixes or enabling previously patched gas calculation vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasScheduleV2::diff()] [Governance obfuscation] The diff function only shows Add/Delete/Modify operations - can attackers craft proposals with hundreds of small Modify operations mixed with critical malicious changes, overwhelming governance reviewers and hiding dangerous gas alterations in noise? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasSchedule] [Emergency response failure] If a critical gas misconfiguration is applied (e.g., all costs set to 0), how quickly can governance revert it, and could the network remain operational long enough to process the revert proposal given the flood of exploitative transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [OnChainConfig Implementation] [Cross-module attack] Since GasSchedule, GasScheduleV2, and StorageGasSchedule are separate OnChainConfig types, can an attacker propose updating only one while leaving others at incompatible values, causing version mismatches or undefined behavior in gas calculation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleV2] [Atomic update failure] If a governance proposal updates GasScheduleV2 but the corresponding Move VM gas calculation code isn't updated atomically in the same epoch transition, could this create a window where old gas logic uses new gas values incorrectly, causing overcharging or undercharging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/gas_schedule.rs] [Function: GasScheduleV2::diff()] [Diff manipulation] Can an attacker submit a proposal that claims to only Modify a few entries (as shown by diff), but the actual deserialized GasScheduleV2 after voting contains additional malicious entries not shown in the diff due to serialization bugs or duplicate handling? (High)"
