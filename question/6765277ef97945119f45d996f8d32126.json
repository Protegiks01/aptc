  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 96-97] [Server configuration] The Server::bind() uses default configuration - are there any security-relevant options (keep-alive timeouts, connection limits, etc.) that should be explicitly set to prevent resource exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Match exhaustiveness] The URI path matching uses a catch-all pattern (_) for invalid endpoints - can this mask bugs where valid endpoints fail to match due to path parsing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 177-186] [Method handling order] The method validation happens after endpoint routing and potentially expensive handler calls - should method validation occur first to avoid unnecessary work for invalid methods? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Multiple endpoints] An attacker can query configuration, identity, peer information, and metrics endpoints in sequence - can combining information from multiple endpoints reveal more sensitive data than any single endpoint, such as complete validator operational security posture? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 112-160] [Endpoint correlation] Can attackers correlate timestamps across different endpoint responses to infer the exact timing of validator state changes, consensus rounds, or epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 138-146] [Metrics vs peer data] Can attackers compare metrics endpoint data with peer_information endpoint data to identify inconsistencies that reveal validator misbehavior, hidden peers, or state manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 104-198] [Snapshot consistency] Each request gets a cloned view of node_config and other state - can inconsistent snapshots across concurrent requests reveal transient states that expose validator internal operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 83-89] [Config staleness] Cloning node_config for each request - if the configuration changes during operation, can stale configuration data be returned, potentially showing disabled endpoints as enabled or vice versa? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 117-121] [Async consensus check] The consensus_health_check is async - can concurrent calls during epoch transitions return inconsistent results, causing confusion about validator health status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 147-155] [Peer information complexity] The peer_information handler performs multiple data gathering operations - if any operation fails or hangs, does this cause the entire request to fail gracefully or result in partial/corrupted output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [HTTP/1.1 compliance] The service uses hyper's HTTP implementation - are there any HTTP/1.1 request smuggling or desync vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass endpoint access controls or inject malicious requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 172-175] [Header injection] Response headers are set programmatically - can handler-returned content_type values include newlines or other control characters that enable HTTP response splitting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 189-197] [Error response building] When response building fails, a new response is constructed - can failures in this error handling path cause panics or expose even more sensitive error information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Access logging] There's no visible access logging mechanism - can attackers repeatedly query sensitive endpoints without detection, enabling prolonged intelligence gathering campaigns against validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 178-179] [HEAD method abuse] HEAD requests return the same status codes as GET but without body - can attackers use HEAD requests to probe endpoints without triggering the same monitoring/alerting as GET requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 189-191] [Debug logging] Errors are logged with debug! level - will these logs be captured in production environments, or can attackers exploit this to perform reconnaissance without leaving audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: start_inspection_service()] [Mainnet exposure] On mainnet, the inspection service can expose critical validator information if endpoints aren't properly disabled - is there runtime validation that mainnet validators have the correct configuration, or is this only checked at config load time? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 112-160] [Default configs] If validators use default configurations without customization, are sensitive endpoints enabled by default, creating a widespread information disclosure vulnerability across the mainnet validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 55-57] [Network binding] The service binds to address and port from config - can validators accidentally bind to public IPs instead of localhost/VPN IPs, exposing the inspection service to the public internet on mainnet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 142-146] [Metrics granularity] Fine-grained metrics exposure - can attackers use high-frequency polling of metrics to perform statistical analysis of validator behavior, identifying patterns that reveal when validators are processing high-value transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 117-121] [Health check timing] Consensus health checks reveal when validators are participating - can attackers time attacks to coincide with periods when multiple validators show degraded health, maximizing the impact of Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 1-18] [Hyper dependency] The service uses hyper for HTTP handling - are there any known vulnerabilities in the hyper version being used that could be exploited through crafted HTTP requests to the inspection service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 5-8] [Dependencies] The service depends on aptos-config, aptos-data-client, aptos-network - can vulnerabilities in these dependencies be exploited through the inspection service interface? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 94-100] [Single-threaded blocking] The runtime blocks on server execution - can a single blocking operation in any handler freeze the entire inspection service, preventing health checks and monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 147-155] [Expensive operations] The peer_information handler performs expensive data gathering - can repeated requests cause the inspection service to become unresponsive, potentially masking actual validator issues from monitoring systems?
