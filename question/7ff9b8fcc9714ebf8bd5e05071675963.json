  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/tap_captcha.rs] [Function: create_challenge()] [Concurrent Creates] If two threads call create_challenge() and both generate the same key, which captcha value wins? Could this cause user confusion or validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/tap_captcha.rs] [Function: check()] [Header Injection] Headers are directly parsed without sanitization. Can attackers inject control characters or exploit header parsing vulnerabilities to bypass captcha validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/tap_captcha.rs] [Function: check_challenge()] [Key Type Mismatch] The key is u32, but what if header parsing results in values that overflow or underflow? Are negative values, scientific notation, or hex values properly rejected? (Low)"
