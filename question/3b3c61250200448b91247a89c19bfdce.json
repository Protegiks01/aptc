(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/bcs.rs] [Function: native_to_bytes()] [Allocation bombing] Does the function impose any limits on the size of serialized_value created at line 73-74, or can attackers trigger multi-gigabyte allocations that DoS validators even with proper gas charging? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/bcs.rs] [Function: native_to_bytes()] [Error distinguishability] Both type layout failure (line 61) and serialization failure (line 77) return the same NFE_BCS_SERIALIZATION_FAILURE code - can attackers exploit this lack of error granularity to hide specific attack patterns?
