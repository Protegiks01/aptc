(Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/double.rs] [Function: double_internal()] [Assertion bypass] The assert_eq!(1, ty_args.len()) at line 25 checks type argument count, but can an attacker exploit Move VM bugs to pass zero type arguments after this assertion executes, causing None from structure_from_ty_arg!?

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/double.rs] [Function: double_internal()] [None structure handling] When structure_from_ty_arg! returns None for an invalid type, does the match statement at lines 28-74 properly handle this by falling through to the default case, or can timing attacks distinguish between None and disabled feature flags? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/double.rs] [Function: double_internal()] [Type argument injection] Can an attacker exploit Move VM's type system to inject additional type arguments beyond the asserted single argument, causing structure_from_ty_arg! to extract the wrong type?
