  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataPayload Enum] [Transaction Proof Validation] Are TransactionListWithProofV2 proofs validated to ensure transactions are actually committed in the advertised ledger info? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataPayload Enum] [Output Proof Validation] Are TransactionOutputListWithProofV2 proofs validated to ensure outputs correspond to executed transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataClientRequest Enum] [Request Type Mismatch] Can the request type in DataClientRequest not match the expected response type in DataPayload, causing type confusion during processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataClientRequest Enum] [Variant Exhaustiveness] Are all match statements on DataClientRequest exhaustive, or can new variants be added that bypass existing validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataPayload Enum] [Unexpected Variants] Can receiving an unexpected DataPayload variant (e.g., EndOfStream when expecting transactions) cause panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [All Request Types] [Missing Validation] Are all struct fields in request types validated for reasonable ranges and consistency before being used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [SubscribeTransactionsWithProofRequest] [Stream Hijacking] Can an attacker guess or brute-force subscription_stream_id values to hijack active subscription streams and inject malicious data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [SubscribeTransactionOutputsWithProofRequest] [Index Replay] Can resetting subscription_stream_index to a previous value cause already-processed outputs to be replayed and re-applied? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [SubscribeTransactionsOrOutputsWithProofRequest] [Mode Switching Attack] Can rapidly switching between transaction and output modes in subscriptions cause validators to have inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [All Subscribe Requests] [Subscription Leak] Can subscription streams remain open indefinitely, accumulating in memory and causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [All Subscribe Requests] [Subscription Starvation] Can one subscription consume all available bandwidth or processing resources, starving other subscriptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [DataPayload Enum] [Empty Payload] Can DataPayload variants contain empty lists or proofs (e.g., empty TransactionListWithProofV2) that bypass validation logic expecting non-empty data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [StateValuesWithProofRequest] [Zero-Length Range] Can start_index equal end_index create a zero-length range that causes division by zero or empty chunk processing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/data-streaming-service/src/data_notification.rs] [EpochEndingLedgerInfosRequest] [Single Epoch Request] Can start_epoch equal end_epoch request a single epoch, and is this edge case handled correctly without off-by-one errors? (Low)",
