  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: abort_on_error()] [Sender drop] What happens if BytesSender is dropped without calling finish() or abort()? Can this leave the stream in a hanging state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Static: LATENCY_HISTOGRAM] [Metric cleanup] Are metrics cleaned up on backup service shutdown, or can stale metrics persist across restarts causing monitoring confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bcs_bytes()] [Zero-length serialization] What happens if bcs::to_bytes() returns an empty Vec<u8>? Does THROUGHPUT_COUNTER handle zero-byte updates correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bytes_sender()] [Empty backup] If the closure immediately calls sender.finish() without sending any data, is this handled correctly by the stream consumer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: unwrap_or_500()] [Double error] If the Ok(resp) branch contains a Reply that itself represents an error state, can this cause confusing error semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: handle_rejection()] [Empty rejection] Can warp generate empty Rejections, and if so, does the debug formatting handle them gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bcs_bytes()] [Checksum absence] Does reply_with_bcs_bytes include any checksums or integrity checks in the response, or can backup data corruption go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bytes_sender()] [Stream ordering] If the closure sends data in multiple chunks, is ordering guaranteed, or can chunks arrive out-of-order causing backup corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: abort_on_error()] [Partial data] If abort() is called mid-stream, can clients receive partial backup data without realizing it's incomplete, leading to failed restoration attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bcs_bytes()] [Serialization efficiency] Does bcs::to_bytes() allocate a new Vec for every call, causing memory churn? Can this be optimized with reusable buffers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bytes_sender()] [Thread pool contention] Does tokio::task::spawn_blocking share a global thread pool? Can backup operations contend with other blocking operations in the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Static: LATENCY_HISTOGRAM] [Metric overhead] What is the performance overhead of recording latency for every backup operation? Can this impact high-frequency backup scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bytes_sender()] [BackupHandler state] Does BackupHandler maintain any mutable state that could be corrupted by concurrent cloning and usage across multiple tasks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-service/src/handlers/utils.rs] [Function: reply_with_bcs_bytes()] [Metric label cardinality] How many unique endpoint values are there? Can unbounded endpoint diversity cause metric cardinality explosion in Prometheus? (Low)",
