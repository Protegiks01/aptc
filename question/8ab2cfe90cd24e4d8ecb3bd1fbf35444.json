  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Index Explosion] Can an attacker cause the creation of billions of index entries by repeatedly updating the same state keys, causing database size explosion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Pruning Backlog] If index entries are created faster than pruning can delete them, can this cause an unbounded backlog that eventually exhausts disk space? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Error Propagation] If write_u64() or write_all() returns an error, is the partially-constructed Vec properly dropped without leaving garbage in memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Error Recovery] When ensure_slice_len_gt() fails, is the error properly propagated up to the caller, or can silent failures cause pruning to skip corrupted entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Partial Decode] If read_u64() succeeds for stale_since_version but fails for version, can this leave the system in an inconsistent state with partially decoded data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Strict Validation] Should decode_value() be more permissive and ignore unexpected data, or is the strict ensure_slice_len_eq(data, 0) check correct for security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Corruption Detection] Does the schema include any checksums or integrity checks to detect database corruption beyond basic length validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Version Compatibility] If the encoding format changes in a future version (e.g., adding metadata), can old nodes still decode new entries or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Migration Path] If migrating from StaleStateValueIndexSchema to StaleStateValueIndexByKeyHashSchema, can index entries be missed or double-counted during the transition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Backward Compatibility] If a node downgrades to an older version that expects different key encoding, will it be able to read existing index entries or will pruning break? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Column Family Changes] Can changes to STALE_STATE_VALUE_INDEX_CF_NAME cause existing database entries to become inaccessible without proper migration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [StateKey Hash] Since the schema uses full StateKey rather than hash, can this leak information about state structure that should remain private? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Key Predictability] Can an attacker predict the encoded key format and craft database queries that target specific index entries for DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Hash Collision] In sharded mode using StateKey hashes, can hash collisions cause two different state keys to map to the same index entry, causing wrong values to be pruned? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Non-Deterministic Encoding] Can encode_key() produce different outputs for the same input on different machines due to platform differences in BigEndian implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Non-Deterministic Decoding] Can decode_key() interpret the same byte slice differently on different validator nodes, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Validator Disagreement] Can differences in pruning behavior across validators (due to encoding inconsistencies) cause them to have different database states, affecting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Ordering Guarantee] Is the BigEndian ordering guarantee sufficient to ensure all validators iterate indices in the same order during pruning, or can platform differences cause divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Usage] [State Store Integration] When StateStore creates index entries, can misalignment between the index and actual state values cause pruning to delete active state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Usage] [Pruner Integration] Can the pruner's iteration logic skip index entries due to encoding mismatches between encode_seek_key() and the actual key format? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Usage] [Merkle Tree Sync] If pruning deletes state values referenced by the Jellyfish Merkle Tree, can this cause proof generation failures or incorrect state commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Usage] [Snapshot Consistency] During snapshot creation, can ongoing pruning operations cause snapshots to reference deleted state values via stale indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Usage] [Transaction Rollback] If a transaction is rolled back after creating index entries, can orphaned indices remain pointing to non-existent state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Key Length Limit] Does RocksDB impose a maximum key length, and if so, can extremely long StateKeys cause encode_key() to produce keys that get silently truncated or rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Uninitialized Memory] Can decode_key() read from uninitialized memory if the database returns garbage data, potentially leaking sensitive information? (Medium)"
