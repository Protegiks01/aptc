  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious output_directory path (e.g., '../../../etc/') to write generated documentation files to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting system files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Does the code validate that template file paths don't contain directory traversal sequences (../, ..\\) that could read sensitive files from the filesystem when templates are loaded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can the references_file parameter be exploited to read arbitrary files from the system by providing paths like '/etc/passwd' or '../../../sensitive_data'? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Arbitrary File Write] At line 114, fs::write() is called without checking if files already exist - can an attacker overwrite critical project files by triggering docgen with a crafted output path? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] Does the code follow symbolic links when writing documentation files, allowing an attacker to create symlinks in the output directory that point to sensitive system files, causing them to be overwritten?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any limit on the size of generated documentation content - could malicious Move code with extremely long doc comments cause memory exhaustion when held in the 'content' variable?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: section_level_start] [Logic Error] At line 76, the code uses unwrap() to extract section_level_start without validating it's within reasonable bounds (e.g., 1-6 for markdown headers) - could invalid values cause malformed documentation or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: toc_depth] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide an extremely large toc_depth value that causes performance degradation or memory exhaustion when generating table of contents with deeply nested sections? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Handling] If fs::write() fails at line 114 for one file but succeeds for others, are earlier written files cleaned up, or does this leave orphaned documentation files? (Low)",
