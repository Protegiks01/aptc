  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 14-24] [Access Control] Are all modules declared as public intentionally exposed as part of the library's public API, or should some modules (connectivity_manager, peer_manager, protocols) be made private to prevent external misuse and reduce attack surface? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 15] [API Surface] Does exposing the application module publicly allow external crates to bypass intended network abstractions, potentially creating unauthorized network communication channels that could be exploited by malicious actors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 16] [API Surface] Does the public exposure of connectivity_manager allow external manipulation of peer connectivity decisions, potentially enabling attackers to force connections to malicious nodes or disconnect legitimate validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 20] [Cryptographic Exposure] Is the noise module (presumably implementing Noise Protocol cryptographic handshakes) safely exposed, or could direct access allow attackers to bypass intended security layers and perform man-in-the-middle attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 21] [API Surface] Does public exposure of the peer module allow external code to manipulate peer state or metadata, potentially leading to peer impersonation or unauthorized state modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 22] [API Surface] Is the peer_manager module safely exposed publicly, or could external access enable attackers to manipulate peer lifecycle management, causing peer disconnections or unauthorized peer additions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 23] [Protocol Security] Does exposing the protocols module publicly allow external code to register or manipulate network protocols, potentially enabling protocol confusion attacks or unauthorized message injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 24] [Transport Layer] Is the transport module appropriately exposed, or could direct access allow attackers to bypass transport-layer security checks, perform TCP/UDP manipulation, or create unauthorized network connections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 31] [Type Alias] Does the ConnectivityRequest type alias properly encapsulate connectivity_manager internals, or can external code create malformed connectivity requests that bypass validation in the underlying ConnectivityRequest type? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 32] [Type Alias] Does the ProtocolId type alias expose protocol identification internals that could allow attackers to forge protocol identifiers, leading to protocol confusion or unauthorized protocol registration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 32] [Deep Path Exposure] Does exposing protocols::wire::handshake::v1::ProtocolId reveal versioning details that could be exploited for version downgrade attacks during handshake negotiation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 26-29] [Fuzzing Exposure] Is the fuzzing module properly gated behind feature flags to prevent accidental exposure in production builds, or could a misconfigured build accidentally include fuzzing harnesses that expose internal state or create attack vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 26] [Feature Flag] Does the fuzzing feature flag have proper guards to ensure it's never accidentally enabled in production validator builds, which could expose fuzzing interfaces that allow state manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 28-29] [Testing Code] Are testutils properly isolated to test/fuzzing builds only, or could they be accidentally compiled into production, exposing test-only APIs that bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 7] [Resource Exhaustion] Is the recursion limit of 1024 sufficient to prevent stack overflow attacks when processing deeply nested select! macros in async network code, or could malicious peers craft messages that trigger excessive recursion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Line: 7] [Compiler Directive] Does increasing the recursion limit to 1024 create any security risks where previously rejected code with excessive complexity is now accepted, potentially hiding vulnerabilities in complex control flow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Overall Structure] Does this lib.rs file lack explicit access control documentation or #[doc] comments warning about the security implications of using exposed modules directly, potentially leading to misuse by other crates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] Are there missing privacy boundaries where internal implementation modules should be encapsulated in a private submodule to prevent external crates from depending on internal details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Overall Structure] Does the lack of re-exported types/traits force external crates to directly import from submodules, creating tight coupling that could expose internal changes or security-sensitive APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Module Dependencies] Do the exposed modules create circular dependency risks where external crates could import conflicting versions of network types, leading to type confusion or memory unsafety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [API Design] Is there a clear security boundary between what's exposed in lib.rs versus what should remain internal, or could the current flat exposure allow external code to bypass intended security layers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 14-24] [Module Interaction] Could an attacker leverage the combination of exposed modules (e.g., accessing both connectivity_manager and peer_manager directly) to create race conditions or state inconsistencies not possible through intended APIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 14-24] [Privilege Escalation] Does the flat public exposure of all modules allow external code to combine module APIs in ways that bypass security checks, such as using transport directly while avoiding connectivity_manager's authorization? (High)"
