  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker craft malicious shard path configurations with relative paths or symbolic links to bypass the absolute path check at line 61-63, potentially writing database shards to unauthorized locations and corrupting critical system files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Integer Overflow] Does the shard_id validation at line 66-68 properly handle u8 overflow scenarios where malicious configs specify shard IDs near u8::MAX, potentially causing wraparound when used as array indices and leading to out-of-bounds memory access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Duplicate Detection Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the duplicate shard ID detection logic at lines 69-73 by providing duplicate IDs through different parsing paths (e.g., '5' and '5-5') to map multiple shards to the same path, causing data corruption when concurrent writes occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can a malicious node operator configure an excessive number of shard paths (up to 16 shards) all pointing to the same disk, bypassing intended sharding benefits and causing disk I/O bottlenecks that degrade validator performance below consensus thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Incomplete Shard Coverage] Does the function validate that all required shards (0-15) are configured, or can an attacker provide incomplete shard configurations causing the node to fail when accessing unmapped shards, leading to state sync failures and validator ejection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Path Injection] Can special characters or unicode in path strings bypass path validation and be interpreted differently by the filesystem versus the config parser, allowing directory traversal attacks despite the absolute path check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::get_shard_paths()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race between path validation and actual usage where an attacker could swap a valid absolute path with a malicious symlink after validation but before database initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Integer Parsing] Can malicious input strings with leading zeros (e.g., '00-09') or special number formats bypass the u8::from_str parsing at lines 86, 91-92, causing unexpected shard ID assignments or panics that crash the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Range Validation] Does the range validation at line 93 properly handle edge cases where range_start equals range_end (e.g., '5-5'), and could this be exploited to create single-element ranges that bypass duplicate detection in get_shard_paths()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Malformed Input] Can an attacker provide malformed range strings (e.g., '1-2-3', '1--2', '-1') that cause the num_or_range split logic at line 83 to behave unexpectedly, potentially panicking or returning incorrect shard IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Denial of Service] Can extremely long comma-separated shard lists cause excessive memory allocation in the shard_ids vector or create performance issues during parsing, leading to node slowdowns during config reloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Empty String Handling] What happens if an empty string or whitespace-only input is provided to parse()? Can this cause empty shard_ids vectors that violate invariants expected by get_shard_paths() callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ShardedDbPathConfig::parse()] [Negative Number Bypass] Although u8 cannot represent negatives, can crafted inputs like '-1' or '255-0' (reverse range) bypass validation and cause integer underflow or unexpected behavior in range iteration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Resource Exhaustion] Can a malicious operator set max_open_files to i32::MAX at line 129, causing the node to exhaust file descriptors and crash, or set it to negative values that bypass resource limits entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Memory Exhaustion] Can max_total_wal_size be set to u64::MAX at line 131, causing unbounded WAL growth that exhausts disk space and prevents new transactions from being committed, leading to validator ejection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [CPU Exhaustion] Can max_background_jobs be set to i32::MAX at line 133 to spawn excessive background threads, causing CPU exhaustion that prevents timely block processing and breaks consensus liveness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Block Cache Misconfiguration] Is the deprecated block_cache_size at line 136 still used anywhere despite being marked deprecated? Can conflicting values between this and shared_block_cache_size cause memory accounting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Block Size Attack] Can block_size at line 138 be set to extremely small values (e.g., 1 byte) or extremely large values (e.g., u64::MAX), causing either excessive I/O operations or memory allocation failures that crash the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Index Type Manipulation] Can different IndexType values at line 140 be exploited to degrade read performance below consensus requirements? For example, forcing BinarySearch on large datasets to cause timeout-based validator penalties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Cache Bypass] When cache_index_and_filter_blocks is false at line 144, can this cause excessive disk I/O that degrades validator performance, and is this exploitable by insider validators to harm network throughput?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Struct: RocksdbConfig] [Stats Dump DOS] Can stats_dump_period_sec be set to 0 or 1 at line 153, causing continuous log dumps that fill disk space and crash the node through disk exhaustion? (Medium)",
