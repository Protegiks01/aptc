  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Integration: StorageLocation] [State Key Collision] Can the StateKey generated for TransactionFeeBurnCap collide with other on-chain config keys, allowing unauthorized access to burn capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [fetch_config Error Handling] When fetch_config fails to retrieve TransactionFeeBurnCap from storage, can improper error handling lead to using stale or default burn capabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Uninitialized State] Can TransactionFeeBurnCap be accessed before genesis initialization completes, leading to Option::None panics or use of uninitialized burn capabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [State Caching] If the system caches TransactionFeeBurnCap for performance, can cache invalidation failures during governance upgrades cause validators to use outdated burn cap configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Concurrent Fetches] Can concurrent fetch_config calls for TransactionFeeBurnCap from multiple threads lead to TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Move Integration] [Capability Leak] If the Move module's AptosCoinCapabilities struct is modified to add fields, can the Rust TransactionFeeBurnCap still deserialize correctly without exposing those new fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Move Integration] [Friend Module Abuse] Can malicious friend modules in transaction_fee.move abuse their access to modify AptosCoinCapabilities in ways that bypass Rust-side validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Move Integration] [Burn Cap Duplication] Can the burn capability represented by TransactionFeeBurnCap be duplicated or cloned on the Move side, allowing unlimited fee burning or fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Move Integration] [FA vs Coin Migration] During migration from AptosCoinCapabilities to AptosFABurnCapabilities, can TransactionFeeBurnCap access both versions simultaneously, causing double-burning or burn failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Move Integration] [Feature Flag Bypass] Can an attacker bypass feature flag checks (operations_default_to_fa_apt_store_enabled) by manipulating how TransactionFeeBurnCap is fetched? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Epoch Boundary] During epoch reconfiguration, can TransactionFeeBurnCap become temporarily unavailable or corrupted, allowing transactions to execute without fee burns? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Reconfiguration Atomicity] Is the update of TransactionFeeBurnCap during reconfiguration atomic with validator set changes, or can race conditions lead to using burn caps from the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Genesis Bootstrap] During genesis, can the TransactionFeeBurnCap be improperly initialized, leading to permanent inability to burn transaction fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Reconfiguration Events] Can an attacker suppress or manipulate reconfiguration events to prevent TransactionFeeBurnCap updates, freezing the burn cap at an exploitable version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [ADDRESS Constant] The OnChainConfig::ADDRESS defaults to '0x1' - can an attacker create a conflicting TransactionFeeBurnCap at a different address and trick the system into using it? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Core Address Validation] Is the CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (0x1) properly validated when fetching TransactionFeeBurnCap to prevent address spoofing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Multi-Address Attack] Can an attacker publish AptosCoinCapabilities at multiple addresses and cause confusion about which burn cap is authoritative? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Clone Safety] The Clone trait is derived - can cloning TransactionFeeBurnCap instances lead to multiple simultaneous references to the same burn capability, causing double-burns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Debug Leakage] Does the Debug trait implementation leak sensitive information about burn capabilities in logs or error messages? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Eq Consistency] Is the Eq implementation consistent with PartialEq, and can any inconsistency lead to hash table or set corruption? (Low)",
