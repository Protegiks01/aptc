  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Commission Percentage Bounds] Is commission_percentage validated to be <= 100, or can values > 100 cause arithmetic errors or negative rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Empty Vector Exploitation] The function passes empty vec![] as the last parameter - can this be exploited if the on-chain function expects non-empty data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Prompt Bypass] Can the prompt_yes_with_override confirmation be bypassed programmatically to create unauthorized contracts in automated attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Duplicate Contract Creation] Can an attacker create multiple contracts with the same parameters to spam the network or cause confusion in contract tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Zero Amount Contract] Can creating a contract with amount=0 be exploited to create ghost contracts that consume storage or interfere with validator accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Admin Address Spoofing] Can an attacker specify an incorrect admin_address to distribute coins from vesting contracts they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Vesting Contract Address Derivation] Does create_vesting_contract_address with hardcoded (0, &[]) parameters properly derive unique addresses, or can collisions allow distributing from wrong contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Premature Distribution] Can an attacker call this before vesting schedule completes to extract coins before they should be available? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the on-chain vesting_distribute function verify the caller is authorized, or can any user distribute coins from any vesting contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Multiple Distribution Attack] Can this function be called multiple times to distribute the same coins repeatedly if state updates don't properly track distributed amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Reward Theft] Can an attacker distribute accumulated staking rewards that should belong to other shareholders by front-running legitimate distribution calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Hardcoded Parameters] The function uses hardcoded (0, &[]) in create_vesting_contract_address - can this fail for vesting contracts created with different parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Shareholder Bypass] Can the distribution mechanism be exploited to exclude certain shareholders or send disproportionate amounts to specific addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Recipient Manipulation] Does the distribution properly send coins to all shareholders, or can an attacker intercept or redirect distributed coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: DistributeVestedCoins::execute()] [Locked vs Unlocked] Does the function properly differentiate between fully unlocked and still-locked coins, or can locked coins be distributed prematurely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Vesting Schedule Bypass] Can an attacker call this function before the vesting schedule allows to unlock coins prematurely and violate vesting agreements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Admin Address Exploitation] Can specifying an incorrect admin_address allow unlocking vested coins from contracts the caller doesn't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Vesting Contract Derivation Attack] Similar to DistributeVestedCoins, can the hardcoded (0, &[]) parameters in create_vesting_contract_address cause wrong contracts to be unlocked? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Commission Before Unlock] The comments mention paying commission first - can this be exploited to drain rewards through repeated unlock/commission cycles? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Staking Lockup Confusion] The unlocked coins are still subject to staking lockup - can this two-tier locking be exploited to access funds that should remain locked? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Authorization Missing] Does vesting_vest verify the caller is authorized to unlock, or can any user unlock any vesting contract's coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Reward Manipulation] Can repeatedly calling unlock be used to manipulate staking rewards calculation or prevent proper commission distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Partial Unlock Attack] Can an attacker unlock portions of vested coins in ways that violate the intended vesting schedule or cliff periods? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Operator Commission Theft] Can a malicious operator exploit the commission payment during unlock to extract more commission than entitled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: UnlockVestedCoins::execute()] [Multiple Unlock Race] Can concurrent unlock calls for the same vesting contract cause double-unlocking or inconsistent state? (High)"
