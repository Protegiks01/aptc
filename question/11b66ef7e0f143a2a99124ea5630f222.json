  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: collection_name()] [String cloning costs] Does returning &String from getters force unnecessary clones in consuming code, and could an attacker exploit this to amplify gas costs by creating events with extremely long collection names that get repeatedly cloned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: old_description()] [Data exposure] Can the old_description() getter leak sensitive information if the old description contained private data that should have been redacted before the mutation event was emitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: new_description()] [Content validation] Does any code validate the content of new_description after retrieval via the getter, or do consuming systems trust that it's safe, potentially enabling injection attacks downstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [All getters] [Reference lifetime] Could the references returned by getters be invalidated if the parent CollectionDescriptionMutate is moved or dropped while references are still held, causing use-after-free in unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Constant: MODULE_NAME] [Module name spoofing] Can an attacker create a malicious contract that defines CollectionDescriptionMutate with MODULE_NAME != 'token_event_store' to emit events that bypass filtering or validation logic that checks module names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Constant: STRUCT_NAME] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the fact that STRUCT_NAME is a compile-time constant to create runtime type confusion by deserializing bytes meant for CollectionDescriptionMutate into a different struct with the same serialization layout? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can an attacker forge events with a modified TypeTag where the module or name fields differ from the lazy static COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE, bypassing event type filters and causing incorrect event routing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [TOKEN_ADDRESS manipulation] Does the type tag use TOKEN_ADDRESS (0x3), and can an attacker deploy a malicious token module at a different address to emit events that are incorrectly classified as legitimate token events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type args injection] The type_args vector is empty in the TypeTag - can an attacker add unexpected type arguments in forged events to exploit generic type handling bugs in event processing code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [struct_tag() reliability] Does the MoveStructType implementation guarantee that struct_tag() always returns consistent results, or can initialization race conditions cause different struct tags to be computed for the same struct? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Can concurrent access to COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE during initial lazy evaluation cause race conditions that result in multiple initializations or inconsistent TypeTag values across threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [Initialization panic] If the Lazy::new closure panics during TypeTag construction, can this poison the static variable and cause all subsequent accesses to panic, effectively DoS-ing event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MUTATE_TYPE] [Memory ordering] Does the once_cell::sync::Lazy guarantee proper memory ordering across all CPU architectures, or could weak memory models cause threads to see uninitialized or partially-initialized TypeTag data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Serialize/Deserialize mismatch] Do the Serialize and Deserialize trait implementations maintain perfect round-trip consistency, or can certain edge cases (e.g., NaN floats if fields change, invalid UTF-8) cause serialize(deserialize(x)) != x? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Version compatibility] If the struct fields are reordered or new fields are added in future versions, will old deserialized events fail gracefully or corrupt data due to BCS format version mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Backward compatibility] Can events serialized with older versions of CollectionDescriptionMutate be deserialized with newer code, or will breaking changes cause indexer failures when processing historical events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Canonical encoding] Does BCS enforce canonical encoding, or can an attacker create two different byte sequences that both deserialize to the same CollectionDescriptionMutate but have different hashes, enabling collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV2Type] [Event creation failures] When create_event_v2() is called on a CollectionDescriptionMutate instance, can serialization failures cause the event to be silently dropped, or do they propagate errors that could abort transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV2Type] [Type tag mismatch] Can there be a mismatch between the TypeTag computed by create_event_v2() and the actual Move type being emitted, causing events to be incorrectly routed or filtered? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV2Type] [Gas metering bypass] Does event creation properly account for gas costs based on serialized event size, or can an attacker emit arbitrarily large CollectionDescriptionMutate events at fixed gas cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Move integration] [Event emission spam] Can an attacker repeatedly emit CollectionDescriptionMutate events in a single transaction without proper rate limiting, flooding event logs and overwhelming indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Move integration] [Unauthorized event emission] Does the Move side properly restrict who can call emit_collection_description_mutate_event, or can any account emit fake mutation events for collections they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Replay attacks] Since CollectionDescriptionMutate doesn't include a nonce or sequence number, can an attacker replay old mutation events to confuse indexers about the current description of a collection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Event ordering] If multiple description mutations happen in the same transaction, is event ordering guaranteed, or can reordering cause indexers to compute incorrect final states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Timestamp missing] Does the event include any timestamp or version number to establish causality, or must indexers rely solely on transaction ordering which could be manipulated by validators?
