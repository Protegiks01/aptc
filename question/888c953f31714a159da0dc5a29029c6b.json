  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Identity] [Identity::Anyone] Does Identity::Anyone properly implement authentication bypass, or could the semantic meaning of 'Anyone' be misinterpreted by storage backends as 'authenticated anyone' vs 'literally anyone including unauthenticated attackers'? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Identity] [Identity::Anyone] Can Identity::Anyone override more specific Identity::User permissions through policy evaluation precedence issues, allowing public access to override intended restricted access to validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Identity] [Identity::NoOne] Is Identity::NoOne properly enforced to deny all access, or can storage backend bugs bypass NoOne checks, allowing attackers to access supposedly inaccessible data like archived old validator keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Identity] [Identity::NoOne] Does Identity::NoOne prevent even administrative override, potentially creating unrecoverable situations where critical keys become permanently inaccessible even to legitimate recovery procedures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Identity] [Type Confusion] Can identity types be confused during deserialization, where a malicious serialized policy replaces Identity::NoOne with Identity::Anyone through type confusion attacks, exposing protected cryptographic keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Export] Does Capability::Export allow exporting validator private keys in plaintext without additional authentication, creating a critical attack vector where compromised services can steal keys for offline double-signing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Export] Is Capability::Export audit-logged with tamper-evident logs, or can attackers silently export private keys without detection, allowing persistent compromise of validator signing authority? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Export] Can Capability::Export be granted to Identity::Anyone in production configurations, potentially exposing all validator private keys to public internet access through misconfiguration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Read] Does Capability::Read distinguish between reading public keys (safe) vs reading private key material (unsafe), or does a single Read capability grant access to both, violating principle of least privilege? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Read] Can Capability::Read be exploited to enumerate all stored keys and discover the validator set composition, providing attackers with targeting information for focused attacks on specific validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Rotate] Does Capability::Rotate implement atomic key rotation, or can race conditions during rotation lead to states where both old and new keys are simultaneously valid, enabling double-signing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Rotate] Can Capability::Rotate be abused to repeatedly rotate keys causing denial of service, where legitimate consensus operations fail due to using stale keys after aggressive rotation by malicious actors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Rotate] Does Capability::Rotate verify the caller's authority before rotation, or can compromised services rotate validator keys to attacker-controlled keys, enabling complete validator takeover? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Rotate] Is there a rate limit on Capability::Rotate operations, or can rapid rotations cause storage backend exhaustion (e.g., Vault version limits) leading to key storage failures and validator offline status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Sign] Does Capability::Sign implement replay protection, or can attackers with Sign capability repeatedly sign the same consensus message to create signature floods and confuse voting protocols? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Sign] Can Capability::Sign be used to sign arbitrary data, or is it restricted to signing only consensus-valid messages, preventing attackers from using validator keys to sign malicious off-chain contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Sign] Does Capability::Sign enforce safety rules checks before signing, or can compromised services with Sign capability bypass safety rules to create equivocating signatures breaking BFT consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Sign] Is Capability::Sign rate-limited, or can malicious services perform signature DoS attacks by exhausting cryptographic operation quotas in the storage backend, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Write] Does Capability::Write allow overwriting existing data without versioning, enabling attackers to destroy critical state like safety rules data, causing validators to violate consensus invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Write] Can Capability::Write be used to write arbitrary data types, or is type validation enforced, preventing attackers from corrupting storage with malformed data that crashes validator nodes on read? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Write] Does Capability::Write implement atomic writes, or can partial writes due to crashes leave storage in inconsistent states where validators cannot recover their operational state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Enum: Capability] [Capability::Write] Is Capability::Write quota-limited, or can attackers with Write access fill storage backends with garbage data causing validator storage exhaustion and operational failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Deserialization Gadget] Can the Serde Serialize/Deserialize derivations be exploited with gadget chains in deserialization, allowing attackers to craft malicious policy files that execute arbitrary code when loaded by validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Type Confusion] Do the derived Serialize/Deserialize implementations properly validate enum discriminants, or can attackers craft malformed serialized data that causes type confusion between Policy, Permission, Identity, and Capability types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Integer Overflow] Can maliciously crafted serialized policies specify extremely large vector lengths for permissions or capabilities that cause integer overflows during deserialization, leading to memory corruption?
