(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Enum: ExecutionGasEvent::LoadResource] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly trigger LoadResource events with large TypeTag structures that consume excessive memory in the gas log without being properly accounted in the cost field, causing validator memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Enum: ExecutionGasEvent::CreateTy] [Type Confusion] Can malicious code create arbitrarily complex types that cause CreateTy events with underestimated costs, allowing cheap creation of expensive type structures that could crash validators during processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Enum: ExecutionGasEvent::Call] [Recursion Depth] Does the Call variant properly limit recursion depth in the CallFrame structure, or can an attacker create deeply nested calls that cause stack overflow during gas event iteration despite having paid minimal gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: CallFrame] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft transactions that populate the events Vec with millions of ExecutionGasEvent entries, causing validators to run out of memory while trying to store the gas profiling log? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Struct: CallFrame] [Native Gas Accumulation] In line 65, the native_gas field accumulates gas for native functions - can this field overflow if a malicious contract calls native functions in a loop, wrapping around to zero and causing underreported total gas?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Iterator: GasEventIter::next] [Double Counting] When a Call event is encountered (line 182), the iterator pushes the child frame to the stack - can this logic be exploited to count the same gas events multiple times by referencing the same CallFrame from multiple parents?
