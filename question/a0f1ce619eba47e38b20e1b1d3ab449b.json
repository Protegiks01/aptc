  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [State Query Corruption] Can failpoints activated during state queries (get_account_resource, get_table_item) corrupt cached state data or leave locks held indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Merkle Tree Integrity] If failpoints interrupt state proof generation or verification, can this cause Merkle tree inconsistencies or invalid state commitments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Database Transaction Rollback] When failpoints trigger errors, are database transactions properly rolled back, or can partial writes corrupt AptosDB storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Cache Invalidation] Can failpoints leave stale data in API-layer caches (ledger info, validator sets) that persists after the failpoint is cleared, causing inconsistent responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Concurrent Activation] If multiple threads concurrently call fail_point_poem() with the same name, can race conditions in the fail crate's internal state cause undefined behavior or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [TOCTOU in Failpoint Check] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability where the failpoint configuration changes between the fail::fail_point! check and the error return, causing inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Handler Reentrancy] Can failpoints be triggered reentrantly if API handlers call other API functions, potentially causing stack overflow or deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Lock Ordering] When failpoints are activated while holding locks, can this violate lock ordering constraints and cause deadlocks with other API components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Async Context] Since API handlers use async/await, can failpoints interrupt asynchronous operations at unsafe points, leaving futures in invalid states or causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Transaction Submission] In submit_transaction handlers that call fail_point_poem(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Batch Transaction Processing] For batch transaction submissions, if failpoints trigger mid-batch, are already-processed transactions rolled back or committed, potentially causing inconsistent batch results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Account Balance Queries] Can failpoints in get_account_balance handlers return incorrect balance information if triggered after reading balance but before response formatting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Event Queries] If failpoints interrupt event queries, can this cause event cursors to become invalid or skip events in paginated results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [View Function Execution] Can failpoints activated during view_function execution leave the Move VM in an inconsistent state or cause resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Block Queries] If failpoints trigger during block retrieval, can this corrupt block cache entries or cause incorrect block height reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Error Propagation] Does the Result<(), E> return type properly propagate errors through the API handler chain, or can errors be silently swallowed leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Generic Error Type] The function uses generic E: InternalError - can type parameter confusion allow incorrect error types to be returned, bypassing error handling logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Panic Safety] If the fail crate's internal implementation panics, does the #[inline] attribute cause the panic to be optimized incorrectly, leading to undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Error Recovery] After a failpoint is triggered and cleared, does the API properly recover, or can residual state cause subsequent requests to fail even with failpoints disabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Error Code Consistency] Does using AptosErrorCode::InternalError for all failpoint errors mask the actual error source, making debugging impossible and potentially hiding security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Audit Logging] Are failpoint activations logged for security auditing, or can attackers silently crash API endpoints without leaving audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Metric Collection] Are failpoint triggers counted in metrics/telemetry systems, or can widespread failpoint abuse go undetected by monitoring systems? (Low)",
