  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Trait: Send + Sync] [Bound Verification] Are the Send + Sync bounds on boxed errors properly enforced at compile time, or can unsafe code or type coercion bypass these bounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Visibility: Public Structs] [API Stability] Can changes to the public FilterError, FilterStepTrace, or SerializableError APIs break backward compatibility and cause security issues in dependent systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Visibility: Public Fields] [Direct Field Access] Does exposing filter_path and error as public fields allow external code to manipulate error state in ways that violate invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Method: add_trace()] [API Misuse] Can add_trace() be called with inconsistent or contradictory trace information, causing misleading error messages that hide actual security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Integration: anyhow::Error] [Context Loss] When converting from anyhow::Error to FilterError, is the anyhow context chain (added via .context()) properly preserved or does it get flattened? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Integration: anyhow::Error] [Backtrace Loss] Does converting anyhow::Error to FilterError lose backtrace information that could be critical for debugging security incidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Double Boxing] Does the conversion from anyhow::Error create unnecessary Box allocations (anyhow is already boxed), causing performance overhead in error-heavy code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Edge Case: Empty filter_path] [Zero-Length Path] Can FilterError exist with an empty filter_path Vec, and if so, does this cause issues in Display formatting or serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Edge Case: Large Traces] [Trace Size Limit] Is there a maximum size limit on filter_path, or can unbounded trace accumulation in recursive filter validation cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Edge Case: Special Characters] [Escaping] Does FilterStepTrace::Display properly escape special characters in serialized_filter and filter_type, or can unescaped characters break formatted output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Edge Case: Null Bytes] [Null Character Handling] Can serialized_filter or filter_type contain null bytes that cause string truncation or issues with C FFI boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Deserialization: FilterError] [Missing Deserialize] FilterError implements Serialize but not Deserialize - can this asymmetry cause issues when trying to reconstruct errors from serialized forms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Deserialization: SerializableError] [Non-Deserializable] Since SerializableError cannot be deserialized (no Deserialize impl), can this break round-trip serialization in distributed systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Performance: String Formatting] [Format Allocation] Does the join() operation in Display::fmt for FilterError allocate unnecessary temporary strings, amplifying resource consumption during high-error-rate scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Performance: Serialization] [JSON Allocation] Can repeated serialization of FilterError through serde_json cause excessive allocations, creating performance bottlenecks in error-heavy workloads? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Integration: gRPC Errors] [Error Mapping] How are FilterErrors mapped to gRPC status codes, and can malicious filters exploit error conditions to cause incorrect gRPC responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Integration: gRPC Metadata] [Error Details] Are FilterError details included in gRPC error metadata, and can this leak sensitive information about indexer internals to clients? (Medium)",
