  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Comment: line 89] [Security review TODO] The TODO comment mentions this was 'copied from das' and 'should review' - has this review been completed, or are there unaddressed security issues from the original DAS implementation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Type: DealtSecretKey] [Type confusion] The DealtSecretKey is simply an alias for Scalar<E> (line 99) - can this lead to type confusion where arbitrary scalars are treated as secret keys without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Type: DealtSecretKeyShare] [No encapsulation] DealtSecretKeyShare is also just Scalar<E> (line 101) - does the lack of a proper type wrapper mean secret key shares lack proper zeroization, validation, or access control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Comment: line 97] [Design concern] The TODO 'maybe make these actual structs' suggests the current type aliases are temporary - are there security implications of using raw Scalar types instead of proper wrapper structs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Type: DealtSecretKey] [Zero value attack] Can a DealtSecretKey be set to zero (since it's just a Scalar), creating a trivial secret that breaks the security of the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Import: line 4] [Dependency on chunked_elgamal] Does the dependency on chunked_elgamal module create circular dependencies or expose internal details that could be exploited if that module has vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Import: line 5] [Crypto library trust] The code imports from aptos_crypto (lines 5-9) - are these cryptographic primitives formally verified, or could bugs in the underlying arkworks library compromise key security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Protocol integration] The ValidCryptoMaterial trait (lines 24-32) integrates with the broader Aptos crypto system - can mismatches in serialization formats between different crypto material types cause protocol failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Parameter injection] The to() method (lines 67-71) takes a reference to PublicParameters - can a Byzantine validator provide a reference to malicious parameters they control, affecting other validators' key derivation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Generic: E: Pairing] [Curve choice] The code is generic over any Pairing implementation - does this allow usage with weak or deprecated elliptic curve pairings (like supersingular curves) that have known attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [G1 vs G2 confusion] EncryptPubKey uses G1Affine (line 21) while DealtPubKey uses G2Affine (line 78) - can confusion between these groups lead to type errors that break pairing-based proofs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Field: ek] [Comment accuracy] The comment on line 19 says 'H^{dk^{-1}}' (dk inverse) but the to() method computes 'H * dk' (not inverse) - is this a cryptographic design flaw or just a documentation error? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Missing dk^{-1}] If the encryption key should be H^{dk^{-1}} as the comment suggests (line 19), but the code computes H^{dk} (line 69), does this break the decryption algorithm's mathematical correctness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: Pairing] [Pairing assumption] Does the security rely on the hardness of the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in pairing groups, and are there parameter choices that could weaken this assumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Shared state] EncryptPubKey derives Clone (line 17) - can multiple threads clone and modify encryption keys concurrently, leading to race conditions in DKG ceremonies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Thread safety] DecryptPrivKey does not implement Send or Sync - could this prevent proper usage in async validator code, forcing unsafe workarounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG state] If multiple threads call generate() with a shared RNG, could race conditions in the RNG state lead to correlated or predictable keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Resource exhaustion] If an attacker creates an EncryptPubKey with a specially crafted point, could serialization on line 29 consume excessive CPU or memory during compression? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Decompression bomb] Can a malicious byte array cause deserialize_compressed() on line 38 to produce an extremely large internal representation, exhausting validator memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Scalar field mismatch] Does the scalar field of DecryptPrivKey.dk match the scalar field used in pubkey_base() multiplication on line 69, or can field mismatches cause incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Inverse operation missing] If decryption requires dk^{-1} but only dk is stored in DecryptPrivKey (line 49), is the inverse computed safely elsewhere, or can division-by-zero or non-invertible elements cause failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: to()] [Scalar reduction] Is the scalar dk automatically reduced modulo the field order during multiplication on line 69, or could overflow/wraparound occur with large dk values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Public field access] The dk field is marked pub(crate) (line 49) - can code within the same crate accidentally expose or misuse the raw secret key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: EncryptPubKey] [Public field exposure] The ek field is marked pub(crate) (line 21) - can internal code directly modify the encryption key, bypassing validation in the conversion function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: new()] [Unchecked constructor] DealtPubKey.new() (line 83) accepts any G2Affine without validation - can callers create invalid public keys that break security assumptions? (High)"
