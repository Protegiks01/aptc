  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Hidden functionality] Could there be undocumented tool names beyond 'bench' and 'plot' that activate hidden functionality if an attacker discovers the secret strings through reverse engineering or source code analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Debug backdoors] Can an attacker trigger debug or development mode functionality by providing specially crafted arguments that bypass the normal string matching at lines 19-26? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error state persistence] When plot::plot_svg() returns an error at line 22, could this leave the system in an exploitable error state where subsequent invocations behave differently or have weakened security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Cascading failures] Can an error in benchmark::benchmark() at line 20 cause cascading failures in other system components if error cleanup is not performed correctly, potentially affecting the Move Prover's security guarantees?
