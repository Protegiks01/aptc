  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: RepeatVec] [Bytecode Mutation Testing] RepeatVec is used in Move bytecode verifier mutation testing. If bugs cause incorrect mutation site selection, can this result in insufficient fuzzing coverage of bytecode verification logic, missing type safety violations or resource safety bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: remove_all_impl()] [First Index Boundary] At lines 148-151, if first index equals self.len() exactly (past the end), the function returns early. But if first == self.len() - 1 and is the only index to remove, does the drain() operation handle removing the last physical item correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: remove_all_impl()] [Dedup Impact] After dedup() at line 126, if the logical_indexes Vec becomes empty (all were duplicates), does remove_all_impl() handle this by returning early at line 142-146, or does it attempt to process empty indexes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: get()] [Negative Offset] Since offset is computed as at - start_val.0, and both are usize, offset is always non-negative. But if state is corrupted and at < start_val.0, does underflow cause offset to be a large positive value, returning incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: binary_search()] [Empty Items Edge Case] When items is empty and binary_search(at) is called with any at value, does it return Err(0), and do all callers properly handle this without calling items[0] or items[-1]? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: extend()] [Multiple Extends Same Item] If extend(item_a, 10) is called followed by extend(item_a, 20), are two separate entries created in items, or can this cause confusion when item_a is logically present at multiple index ranges? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: remove_all_impl()] [Panic Unwinding] If any panic occurs within the while loop at lines 173-197 (e.g., in next() or peek()), does the drain at line 170 get properly finalized, or are elements leaked/corrupted due to unwinding? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Function: assert_invariants()] [Performance Impact] If assert_invariants() is called frequently during large proptest runs (thousands of times), can the windows(2) iteration and multiple assertions cause performance degradation that times out security-critical tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Cross-Function] [Invariant Violation Cascade] If extend() adds an element violating invariants (e.g., due to overflow corrupting self.len), can this cause binary_search() to return incorrect results, which causes get() to panic on out-of-bounds access, which causes pick_uniform() to crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Cross-Function] [State Corruption Propagation] If remove_all_impl() leaves the RepeatVec in a corrupted state (e.g., items and len inconsistent), can subsequent extend() calls compound the corruption, leading to catastrophic failure during critical consensus or staking proptests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/repeat_vec.rs] [Cross-Function] [Index Calculation Chain] The chain get(at) -> binary_search(at) -> items[idx] access relies on multiple index calculations. Can accumulated rounding or overflow errors in this chain cause silent data corruption that generates invalid test cases? (Medium)"
