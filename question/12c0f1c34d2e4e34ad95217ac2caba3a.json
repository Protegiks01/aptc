  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/traits.rs] [Cross-component] [Filter + consensus interaction] If filtered transactions are used to inform consensus decisions (e.g., validator performance tracking), can malicious filters cause incorrect consensus state by hiding validator misbehavior transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/traits.rs] [Cross-component] [Filter + governance interaction] Can filters be used to hide governance proposal transactions from indexer clients, allowing malicious proposals to pass undetected by monitoring systems? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/traits.rs] [Cross-component] [Filter + staking interaction] Can filters manipulate which staking/reward transactions are visible to delegators, enabling validators to hide their actual performance or commission changes? (High)",
