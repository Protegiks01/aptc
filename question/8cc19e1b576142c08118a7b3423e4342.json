  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [All macros] [Fuzzing coverage] Have these macros been thoroughly fuzzed with malformed inputs (corrupted values, invalid types, boundary indices) to ensure no panic or undefined behavior paths exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Argument count mismatch] If a native function expects N arguments but the Move caller passes N+1, can repeatedly calling safely_pop_arg! leave extra arguments on the stack causing pollution in subsequent calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Type signature mismatch] Can native functions using these macros have different type signatures than their Move declarations, allowing type confusion when the Move type system believes different types are being passed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Return value handling] After native functions use these macros to process inputs, are return values properly type-checked before being pushed back to the Move VM stack? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Reentrancy] Can native functions using these macros be recursively called, potentially causing stack overflow or infinite loops if macro state is not properly managed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Capability bypass] In privileged native functions (coin minting, governance execution), do these macros enforce caller capability checks, or can attackers bypass capability requirements through crafted arguments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Global state access] When native functions using these macros access global state (accounts, resources), is there proper synchronization to prevent race conditions in parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Integration] [Gas exhaustion] Can attackers craft inputs that cause native functions using these macros to consume excessive gas beyond the transaction limit, causing failed transactions that still charge maximum gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Crypto] [Key material handling] If these macros are used in cryptographic native functions to pop private keys or seeds, does the error handling properly zero sensitive memory on failure to prevent key leakage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Crypto] [Signature validation] When safely_pop_arg! is used to extract signature values in signature verification natives, can attackers pass malformed signatures that bypass validation due to type conversion errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Consensus] [Validator set manipulation] If these macros process validator-related data (stakes, voting power), can type confusion or field access errors allow unauthorized validator set modifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Consensus] [Epoch transition] During epoch reconfiguration, can macro failures cause inconsistent validator state across nodes, leading to consensus failures or network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Consensus] [Timestamp manipulation] If these macros handle block timestamp values, can attackers exploit type conversion to manipulate timestamps and violate consensus timing constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Economic] [Coin amount overflow] When safely_pop_arg! pops u64/u128 values representing APT coin amounts, can overflow during type conversion allow attackers to mint unlimited coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Economic] [Stake calculation] If safely_get_struct_field_as! accesses stake amount fields in validator structs, can incorrect field indexing cause miscalculation of voting power or rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Economic] [Reward distribution] Can macro errors during reward distribution native functions cause rewards to be lost, double-distributed, or sent to wrong addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Economic] [Slashing conditions] When macros process slashing events, can type errors prevent proper penalty application, allowing malicious validators to avoid punishment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Economic] [Fee calculation] If these macros handle transaction fee calculations, can type conversion errors cause incorrect fee charging, either overcharging users or allowing free transactions? (High)"
