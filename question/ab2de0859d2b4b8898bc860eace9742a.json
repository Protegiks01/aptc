  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error Message Injection] The error messages at lines 94 and 124 use format!('{:#}', e) - can an attacker craft error strings containing format string exploits or log injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Context Loss] When with_context() fails at line 69, does the error preserve enough information to debug which specific validator or address caused the failure, or is critical forensic data lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Rollback Semantics] If validator_infos fetch succeeds but subsequent processing fails for all validators, are both returned HashMaps empty, or does one contain partial state causing inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error Recovery] After an error is recorded in invalid_node_address_results, processing continues with the next address - can this allow an attacker to cause partial DoS by registering many invalid addresses that consume processing time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Struct: GetValidatorFullNodes] [URL Validation] Is the node_address URL validated for protocol (must be http/https), presence of host, and absence of credentials, or can a user supply file:// or other dangerous URLs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Struct: GetValidatorFullNodes] [Cloning Overhead] The node_address.clone() at line 38 copies the entire URL - with a very long URL (megabytes), can this cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Struct: NodeInfo] [Null Fields] The api_port field is set to None at line 137 - does downstream code properly handle this optional field, or can None cause null pointer dereferences or logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Struct: NodeInfo] [Field Ordering] If noise_port and api_port are confused in downstream code, can this cause connections to wrong ports or service disruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Dependency on extract_network_address] If the extract_network_address() helper function has bugs (not shown in this file), can they propagate to cause incorrect NodeInfo construction or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [ValidatorInfo Mutation] The validator_info is obtained via iter_mut() allowing mutation - is validator_info actually modified during processing, and could this cause side effects or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Config Deserialization] The validator_info.config().fullnode_network_addresses() call - can the config deserialization be exploited with malformed binary data to return incorrect addresses or cause crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [REST Client State] Is the AptosClient stateful or stateless - if stateful, can concurrent calls to get_validator_infos() corrupt client state or cause race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Async Cancellation] If the async get_account_resource_bcs() call is cancelled mid-execution, does it properly clean up network resources or can it leave dangling connections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Async Safety] The get_node_infos() function is async but performs synchronous operations on HashMaps - are there any await points that could cause race conditions if called concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Mutex Contention] Are the returned HashMaps thread-safe for concurrent reads, or do callers need to wrap them in Arc<Mutex<>> causing potential deadlocks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Allowlist Format] The account_address_allowlist is compared using .to_string() - if allowlist entries use different formats (with/without 0x prefix, different padding), can validators bypass filtering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Allowlist Size] Is there a limit on account_address_allowlist size - can an attacker provide millions of addresses causing the contains() check at line 80 to become O(n) and cause performance DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Case Sensitivity] The .to_string() and .contains() checks - are AccountAddress strings case-sensitive, or can 0xABC vs 0xabc cause bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Network Timeout] Does the REST client have timeout configuration - can a malicious node at node_address stall indefinitely causing the checker to hang? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Continue on Error] The continue statements at lines 99, 111, 129 skip processing - can this allow a validator with mixed valid/invalid addresses to have only valid ones checked, hiding malicious nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Order Dependency] Does the order of VFN addresses in vfn_addresses matter, or can an attacker manipulate ordering to cause the first valid address to hide subsequent malicious ones? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Result Aggregation] Both successful and failed results are returned - does the caller properly check both, or can successful results mask critical failures in invalid_node_address_results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Validator Exclusion] When a validator is skipped due to allowlist filtering, it's silently ignored - should this be logged or reported to detect misconfigured allowlists? (Low)",
