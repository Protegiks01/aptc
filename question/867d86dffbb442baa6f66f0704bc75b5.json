  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource Limits] Are there any resource limits (memory, CPU, network connections) enforced at the process level to prevent resource exhaustion attacks that could make the faucet unavailable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Timing Analysis] Could the time taken between parsing arguments and starting the server reveal information about the configuration or internal state through timing side-channels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: run_command()] [Execution Time] Can an attacker use timing differences in run_command() execution to distinguish between different Server subcommands or infer information about the faucet's operational state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply Chain] Are the clap, tokio, and aptos_faucet_core dependencies pinned to specific versions to prevent supply chain attacks where malicious updates introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Import: aptos_faucet_core] [Module Trust] Does this file assume that aptos_faucet_core::server::Server is always trustworthy, or could a compromised or malicious version of that crate bypass security controls in the faucet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Initialization Order] Could the order of operations (parse args, initialize logger, run command) create a race condition or security vulnerability if multiple instances of the faucet are started simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Global State] Are there any global or static variables that could be manipulated before main() executes, potentially affecting the security posture of the faucet service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [OOM Handling] If the system runs out of memory during argument parsing, logger initialization, or server startup, could this create a security vulnerability or leave the faucet in an exploitable state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/service/src/main.rs] [Debug Trait] [Information Leak] Does the Debug implementation on Args (line 9) potentially expose sensitive configuration data when errors are printed or logged, providing attackers with reconnaissance information? (Medium)"
