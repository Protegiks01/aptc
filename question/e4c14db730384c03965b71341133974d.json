  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: num_interned_tys()] [State fingerprint] Can an attacker use num_interned_tys() and num_interned_ty_vecs() at lines 182-189 to fingerprint validator state and detect when flushes occur, enabling timing attacks or state synchronization attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Flush coordination] If different validators call flush() at different block boundaries (e.g., due to different block processing speeds), can this cause TypeId divergence leading to consensus failures when validators compare execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Enum: TypeRepr] [Ability information] Does TypeRepr store type ability information (Copy, Drop, Store, Key), and if not, can this cause the VM to lose track of what operations are allowed on interned types, breaking Move's resource safety model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: instantiate_and_intern()] [Ability inheritance] When instantiating generic types at lines 277-282, are ability constraints properly checked, or can an attacker instantiate Struct<T> where T must have Copy ability with a type that doesn't, violating Move's type system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: instantiate_and_intern()] [Constraint propagation] Does type parameter substitution at line 263 check that the substituted type satisfies all constraints (abilities, phantom markers), or can invalid substitutions bypass Move's generic constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: TypeVecInterner::intern()] [Empty slice edge case] What happens when intern(&[]) is called at line 227 - does it correctly create a TypeVecId for empty type parameter lists, and can this be confused with uninitialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: struct_of()] [Zero type args] Can struct_of() be incorrectly used for generic structs that require type parameters, and will this cause runtime errors or silent type confusion when the struct is actually used in Move code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: instantiate_and_intern()] [Phantom type parameters] Does the code correctly handle phantom type parameters in generic structs, or can phantom parameters be incorrectly substituted causing issues with Move's type system invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Struct: TypeId] [Zero value] Can TypeId(0) be a valid type identifier, and if so, does this conflict with any code that uses 0 as a sentinel/null value causing incorrect type lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Function: warmup()] [Duplicate warmup] If warmup() is called multiple times (e.g., after flush() fails), can it create duplicate entries for primitive types causing inconsistent TypeIds across the validator lifecycle? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Struct: TypeId] [Equality semantics] Does TypeId equality (comparing u32 values) correctly represent type equality, or can two semantically identical types get different TypeIds due to interning order, breaking Move's type equality checks?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/ty_interner.rs] [Enum: TypeRepr] [Structural equality] Does TypeRepr implement structural equality correctly (comparing nested TypeIds), or can two structurally identical types (e.g., Vector<U64>) be treated as different due to incorrect equality implementation?
