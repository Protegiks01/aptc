  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Chunk count mismatch] If H_vec.len() doesn't match the expected number of chunks per scalar, dlog_vec() will still process all elements - can this cause secret reconstruction to fail silently with partially correct data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Vector allocation] The result vector pre-allocates capacity (line 56) but doesn't reserve exact size - can this cause reallocation overhead for large chunk counts affecting DKG performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Caller expectations] The caller expects u32 discrete logs, but what if the actual secret chunk values need larger representation - is there validation that recovered values fit in the expected range? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Computational DoS] Can an attacker force worst-case performance by ensuring H never matches baby_table, causing the full n-iteration loop (line 35) to execute and delay DKG completion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Memory pressure] With large baby_tables (e.g., 2^16 entries) and many validators simultaneously decrypting shares, can memory pressure from HashMap lookups cause validator nodes to slow down or OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Batch processing overhead] Processing H_vec sequentially (lines 58-64) instead of in parallel could cause linear slowdown - can this be exploited to delay DKG for validators with limited CPU resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Table size optimization] If baby_table is not optimally sized (should be ~sqrt(range_limit)), can attackers force suboptimal configurations during PublicParameters setup to slow down all dlog() operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Generic curve constraint] The function is generic over CurveGroup trait - are there curve implementations that satisfy CurveGroup but have behaviors (e.g., non-prime order) that break BSGS algorithm assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Scalar field mismatch] Can G and H be from different curve groups but still pass type checking, causing scalar multiplications to use wrong field arithmetic and produce incorrect discrete logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Trait bound exploitation] Are there CurveGroup implementations where serialize_compressed() or arithmetic operations have different semantics that break the BSGS algorithm's correctness assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Table completeness] Does baby_table contain all values from 0 to m-1, or can there be gaps - if gaps exist, can the algorithm incorrectly return None for solvable discrete logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Duplicate table entries] If baby_table was built incorrectly and contains j=0 multiple times (for different points), which entry will be found first and could this cause non-determinism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Negative scalar handling] When computing G_neg_m using negation (line 31), does the ScalarField properly handle -m for all valid m values, or can edge cases near field modulus cause incorrect results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Serialization consistency] Is serialize_compressed() deterministic across multiple calls with the same point, or can non-deterministic serialization cause baby_table lookups to randomly fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Identity in table] If the identity element (zero point) is in baby_table at index 0, does the lookup work correctly or does HashMap behavior with zero-filled buffers cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog_vec()] [Empty vector input] If H_vec is empty, dlog_vec() returns Some(vec![]) - is this correct behavior or should it validate that at least one chunk is being decrypted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Range limit too small] If range_limit < baby_table.len(), the algorithm may never check all baby steps in the first giant step - does this cause correctness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/dlog/bsgs.rs] [Function: dlog()] [Range limit too large] If range_limit is much larger than necessary, can the excessive giant steps (large n value) cause timeout during DKG decryption? (Medium)"
