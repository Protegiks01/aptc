  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Missing timestamps] The struct lacks timestamp or sequence number fields - can this enable event replay attacks where old events are re-submitted in new transactions without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [No cryptographic proof] There's no signature or cryptographic proof field linking the event to actual on-chain state - can malicious Move modules emit fake events that never corresponded to real URI changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Serialization format] Since the struct uses serde Serialize/Deserialize, can attackers exploit differences between JSON and BCS serialization to create events that appear valid in one format but malicious in another? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name hardcoding] The MODULE_NAME is hardcoded as 'token_event_store' - can attackers deploy malicious modules with the same name but different addresses, causing type confusion in event routing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct name collision] The STRUCT_NAME 'UriMutationEvent' could collide with identically named structs in other modules - does this create event routing vulnerabilities where events are delivered to wrong handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type tag generation] The struct_tag() method derived from MoveStructType could be exploited to create events with forged type tags - can this bypass type safety checks in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [V1/V2 migration] The empty MoveEventV1Type trait implementation enables V1 events, but Move is migrating to V2 - can attackers exploit version confusion to emit events that appear as V1 to some validators and V2 to others, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [create_event_v1() exploitation] The inherited create_event_v1() method uses unwrap() on BCS serialization - can crafted UriMutationEvent structs with non-serializable data cause panics in validators during event emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Sequence number manipulation] The V1 event system uses EventHandle with sequence numbers - can attackers manipulate sequence numbers during UriMutationEvent emission to create gaps or duplicates, breaking event ordering guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Event key collision] Can multiple UriMutationEvents share the same event key, causing event stream corruption where URI mutations from different tokens get merged or overwritten? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] The Lazy::new() initialization of URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE could have race conditions in multi-threaded validators - can concurrent first access cause multiple initializations leading to inconsistent TypeTag values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [TypeTag forgery] The TypeTag uses TOKEN_ADDRESS constant - can attackers exploit address constant confusion to create events that appear to come from the official token module but actually originate from malicious contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [Type args manipulation] The TypeTag has empty type_args vec - if future versions add type parameters, can old events with empty type_args cause deserialization failures or type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Static: URI_MUTATION_EVENT_TYPE] [StructTag boxing] The StructTag is wrapped in Box::new() - does this introduce heap allocation vulnerabilities where memory exhaustion attacks can be amplified during type tag creation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Gas metering bypass] Does BCS deserialization of UriMutationEvent properly account for gas based on string lengths, or can attackers deserialize massive events while paying minimal gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Storage exhaustion] Can attackers spam thousands of UriMutationEvents with maximum-length strings to exhaust validator storage, requiring expensive state pruning or causing storage system failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Memory amplification] Can a small transaction create UriMutationEvents that decompress or expand to consume disproportionate memory during processing, enabling memory exhaustion DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Indexer DoS] Can malicious events with extremely long URIs or collection names cause indexer databases to slow down or crash when building full-text search indexes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Non-deterministic deserialization] Can differences in Rust standard library versions across validators cause try_from_bytes() to produce different results for the same bytes, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Unicode normalization] Do validators apply consistent Unicode normalization (NFC vs NFD) to collection/token strings, or can normalization differences cause validators to disagree on event content and diverge? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [Event ordering] Can race conditions in concurrent transaction execution cause UriMutationEvents to be emitted in different orders across validators, breaking deterministic consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Struct: UriMutationEvent] [State root divergence] If UriMutationEvents are included in state root calculation, can malformed events cause Merkle tree computation differences leading to state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: creator()] [Creator verification] Does the event system verify that the creator address actually owns the collection/token, or can any address emit fake UriMutationEvents for tokens they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: collection()] [Collection existence] Can UriMutationEvents reference non-existent collections, causing broken links in indexers and confusion about which collections actually exist on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation_event.rs] [Function: token()] [Token existence] Can events claim to mutate URIs for non-existent tokens, enabling attackers to pre-announce tokens before they're minted and squat on valuable names? (Medium)"
