  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on initialization] The new() function calls mint.new_goldenfile().unwrap() without error handling - can an attacker cause test failures by manipulating the file system to make golden file creation fail, potentially masking real API bugs during security audits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Path traversal] The name parameter is used to construct a file path with PathBuf::push() - can a malicious test pass a name containing '../' or absolute paths to write golden files outside GOLDEN_DIR_PATH, potentially overwriting sensitive test data or configuration files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [File extension override] The code unconditionally uses .with_extension('json') - can a test pass 'name.txt' expecting it to remain .txt, creating confusion where test output goes to unexpected files, potentially causing test assertion failures that mask real bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] There's no limit on the number of GoldenOutputs instances that can be created - can concurrent tests create thousands of file handles simultaneously, exhausting system resources and causing legitimate API tests to fail, masking real security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Constant: GOLDEN_DIR_PATH] [Directory traversal] The GOLDEN_DIR_PATH is hardcoded as 'goldens' without path sanitization - if this is used with user-controlled input elsewhere, could it enable directory traversal attacks in test environments that might leak test data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Struct: GoldenOutputs] [Arc without bounds] The struct wraps Mint in Arc but Mint may not be Send+Sync - the #![allow(clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync)] suppresses warnings - can this cause undefined behavior if GoldenOutputs is shared across threads in parallel test execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Mutex poisoning] The file.lock().unwrap() will panic if the mutex is poisoned from a previous panic - can one failing test poison the mutex and cause cascading failures in subsequent tests, making it impossible to identify the root cause of API security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Write ordering] Multiple threads calling log() on a cloned GoldenOutputs will interleave writes non-deterministically - can this cause golden file corruption where test output becomes unparseable, causing false test failures that obscure real API vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Clone semantics] The Clone implementation creates shallow copies sharing the same Arc<Mutex<File>> - can this lead to unexpected behavior where cloning for isolation actually creates shared state, causing test pollution between supposedly independent API test cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Deadlock potential] While holding the mutex lock, write_all() performs I/O which could block indefinitely on slow filesystems - can this cause deadlocks in concurrent test execution, preventing security-critical API tests from completing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Write failure ignored] The write_all().unwrap() will panic on write failures but provides no context - can filesystem errors (disk full, permissions) cause cryptic panics that make it impossible to debug why API security tests are failing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Partial writes] The code assumes write_all() either fully succeeds or fails - but what if the file descriptor is in a weird state where writes partially succeed? Could this corrupt golden files leading to false test passes that miss real API security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Silent failure modes] If Mint::new() succeeds but new_goldenfile() fails, the panic message doesn't indicate which operation failed - can this make it impossible to diagnose why API test infrastructure is failing during security audits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [No flush guarantee] The log() function doesn't explicitly flush the file - can buffered writes remain in memory if a test crashes, causing golden files to be incomplete and making it impossible to verify API behavior during security testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [No fsync] Without fsync, writes may not be durable on disk - if the test system crashes after tests pass but before buffers flush, could this cause golden files to diverge from actual API behavior, masking security regressions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [No write ordering guarantees] Multiple log() calls don't guarantee ordering across threads - can concurrent API tests generate golden files with interleaved content that becomes impossible to parse, failing all subsequent security regression tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [UTF-8 assumption] The code converts str to bytes with as_bytes() but doesn't validate that the file accepts UTF-8 - can non-UTF-8 sequences in API responses corrupt golden files, causing security tests to fail incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Struct: GoldenOutputs] [File handle leak] The File is wrapped in Arc<Mutex> but there's no explicit Drop implementation - can long-running test suites accumulate open file handles until hitting OS limits, causing API security tests to fail with 'too many open files' errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Struct: GoldenOutputs] [Memory leak potential] Mint is stored in Arc but marked as dead_code - is it retained in memory indefinitely? Can this cause memory growth in large test suites that prevents security auditors from running comprehensive API test coverage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Disk space exhaustion] There's no check for available disk space before creating golden files - can tests fill up the disk causing subsequent API security tests to fail, potentially in production CI/CD that validates security properties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Test collision] Multiple tests using the same 'name' parameter will share/overwrite the same golden file - can parallel test execution cause race conditions where one test's API output corrupts another's golden file, leading to false test failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Global state] The Mint instance manages a shared 'goldens' directory - can tests interfere with each other by reading/writing files in this shared space, causing non-deterministic failures in security-critical API tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Constant: GOLDEN_DIR_PATH] [No cleanup mechanism] The code creates golden files but provides no cleanup - can repeated test runs accumulate stale golden files that cause confusion about which API behavior is being validated in security audits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Trait: Debug] [Empty debug output] The Debug implementation returns an empty string - if golden output creation fails, how would a developer debug it? Can this make it impossible to diagnose why API security tests are producing wrong results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Trait: Debug] [No state visibility] The Debug impl provides no visibility into file path, lock state, or write status - can this make it impossible to diagnose concurrent access issues that corrupt golden files during parallel API security testing? (Low)"
