  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Upgrade] [Breaking changes] If MultisigTransactionPayload enum is extended with new variants, will old serialized transactions become undeserializable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Upgrade] [Version mismatch] Can transactions created with old Multisig format execute incorrectly on upgraded nodes, causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Upgrade] [Feature flag] If multisig functionality is controlled by feature flags, can attacker exploit inconsistent flag states across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Edge case] [Empty EntryFunction] Can EntryFunction have zero arguments or zero type arguments, and does this cause undefined behavior in execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum depth] Is there a limit on nesting depth for MultisigTransactionPayload, or can attacker create arbitrarily deep structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Edge case] [Unicode addresses] Can multisig_address contain non-ASCII or invalid UTF-8 bytes causing parsing errors or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Edge case] [Zero gas] Can a Multisig transaction specify zero max_gas_amount and still execute, potentially for free? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Testing] [Untested paths] Are all match arms in try_from() covered by tests, or can production hit unexpected VMStatus variants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Testing] [Fuzzing gaps] Has the Deserialize implementation been fuzzed with random inputs to find crashes or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/multisig.rs] [Testing] [Property testing] Are equality and hash properties tested to ensure reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity hold? (Low)"
