  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Option handling] At line 50 where enable_telemetry_remote_log is checked, if this flag can be toggled at runtime, can race conditions cause the remote_log_receiver to be None when expected, breaking telemetry and hiding security events?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Macro: log_feature_info!] [Macro hygiene] In the macro definition at lines 16-25, can macro expansion inject unintended code or cause syntax errors that prevent compilation, or can macro arguments be manipulated to log false feature states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Macro: log_feature_info!] [Compile-time manipulation] At lines 78-85 where log_feature_info!() is invoked, can an attacker who controls the build environment enable dangerous features like 'failpoints' while making the logs report them as disabled, hiding debugging capabilities from operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: log_config_and_build_information()] [Build info tampering] At line 70 where build_information!() is called, can an attacker who compromises the build system inject false build information that hides the actual node version, making it difficult to track vulnerable deployments?
