  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Edge case: Maximum abort code] What happens when make_abort_code() is called with reason = u16::MAX (65535) - does it produce a valid abort code, overflow, or collide with other abort codes in the error category space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Edge case: Module name length] Are there maximum length limits for module names like VECTOR_MODULE, CMP_MODULE, or the names in VECTOR_FUNCS_WITH_BYTECODE_INSTRS - can excessively long names cause buffer overflows or DoS in module resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Concurrency: Constant mutation] Although Rust constants are immutable, can the constants in this file be modified at runtime through unsafe code, memory corruption, or JIT compilation bugs, causing non-deterministic behavior across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Concurrency: Function caching] If attribute checking functions are called concurrently from multiple threads during parallel transaction execution, can race conditions in string comparison or hash table lookups cause inconsistent attribute validation results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Verification: Constant correctness] Are the well-known constant strings (VECTOR_MODULE, EVENT_EMIT_EVENT, etc.) formally verified to match their actual implementations in stdlib/extlib, or can drift between constant definitions and implementations introduce bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Verification: Abort code injection] Can the prover verify that make_abort_code() produces globally unique abort codes that never collide with user-defined codes, or is this assumption unverified and potentially violable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Verification: Attribute semantics] Are the security implications of test_only, test, and verify_only attributes formally specified and verified, or can semantic confusion about their meaning lead to incorrect compilation decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Supply chain: File tampering] Since this file is in third_party/move/move-model, can upstream changes in the Move repository introduce malicious modifications to well-known constants that get merged into Aptos Core without thorough security review? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Supply chain: Version skew] If different components of Aptos Core use different versions of the Move model library, can they have inconsistent well_known.rs constants causing cross-component incompatibility or security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Encoding: UTF-8 validation] Do all string constants in this file undergo UTF-8 validation before use, or can invalid UTF-8 sequences in module names or function names cause crashes or exploitable parser bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Encoding: String escaping] Are special characters, backslashes, or quotes in constant strings properly escaped, or can injection attacks through malformed module names break string parsing in downstream components? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Testing: Attribute edge cases] Are there comprehensive tests covering all edge cases for is_test_only_attribute_name(), is_test_attribute_name(), and is_verify_only_attribute_name() including Unicode, whitespace, and malformed inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Testing: Abort code collision] Is there fuzz testing or formal verification to ensure make_abort_code() never produces colliding abort codes across all possible reason values and future category additions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Testing: Vector bytecode validation] Are there integration tests that verify all functions in VECTOR_FUNCS_WITH_BYTECODE_INSTRS correctly map to their corresponding bytecode instructions across all VM configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Documentation: Attribute semantics] Is the security-critical distinction between 'test' and 'test_only' clearly documented to prevent developers from misusing attributes and accidentally including test code in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Documentation: Abort code format] Is the abort code format (magic << 24 | category << 16 | reason) documented to prevent user-defined abort codes from colliding with compiler-generated codes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Compatibility: Constant changes] If well-known constants like VECTOR_MODULE or RECEIVER_PARAM_NAME are changed in future versions, can this break on-chain contracts that hardcode these names, causing permanent bricking of deployed code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Compatibility: Abort code evolution] As new compiler errors are added with sequential reason codes, is there a deprecation policy to prevent old abort codes from being recycled with different meanings, which could confuse error handling logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Advanced: Attribute injection] Can malicious macros or procedural code generation inject fake attributes that pass the is_test_only_attribute_name() check but carry additional hidden semantics that alter code behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Advanced: Constant shadowing] Can user code redefine local constants with the same names as well-known constants (e.g., local VECTOR_MODULE), causing namespace confusion that breaks resolution of stdlib functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Advanced: Type confusion] Can the type_info and type_name functions be exploited to forge type identities, making one type appear as another to bypass type-based access controls or resource segregation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/well_known.rs] [Advanced: Bytecode substitution] Can an attacker replace the bytecode implementations of vector functions listed in VECTOR_FUNCS_WITH_BYTECODE_INSTRS with malicious Move functions through module override attacks? (Critical)"
