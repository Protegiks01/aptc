  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Cryptographic key leakage] Can the epoch parameter in save_key_pair_bytes() be manipulated by Byzantine validators to overwrite legitimate key pairs from future epochs, potentially compromising the randomness generation for multiple epochs and breaking consensus security? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key persistence vulnerability] Does save_key_pair_bytes() validate that the Vec<u8> contains valid cryptographic key material before persisting, or can malformed/corrupted key data be stored leading to validator crashes during randomness generation when keys are loaded? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Epoch confusion] Can get_key_pair_bytes() return key pairs from incorrect epochs if multiple key pairs exist in storage, potentially causing validators to use outdated cryptographic material and generate invalid randomness shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Data integrity] Is there validation that AugData being saved matches the current epoch before persistence, or can Byzantine nodes inject augmented data from past/future epochs causing state inconsistencies across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Duplicate detection] Can save_aug_data() be called multiple times with conflicting AugData from the same author and epoch, potentially overwriting valid data with malicious data and breaking randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Signature verification bypass] Does save_certified_aug_data() verify the aggregate signatures in CertifiedAugData before persisting, or can unsigned/invalid certified data be stored allowing forged randomness contributions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Quorum validation] Is there validation that CertifiedAugData contains sufficient validator signatures (>2/3 stake) before storage, or can data with insufficient quorum be persisted leading to invalid randomness generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: get_all_aug_data()] [Memory exhaustion] Can get_all_aug_data() return unbounded amounts of historical augmented data causing memory exhaustion when malicious validators flood storage with excessive AugData entries? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: get_all_certified_aug_data()] [Stale data retrieval] Does get_all_certified_aug_data() filter out data from previous epochs, or can validators retrieve and process stale certified data leading to epoch confusion and randomness generation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Deletion race condition] Can concurrent calls to remove_aug_data() and save_aug_data() create race conditions where valid augmented data is deleted immediately after being saved, breaking randomness generation for that epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Unauthorized deletion] Is there access control preventing Byzantine validators from deleting augmented data belonging to honest validators, potentially preventing them from recovering state after restart? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Premature cleanup] Can remove_certified_aug_data() be called before all validators have processed the certified data, causing loss of critical randomness material and preventing consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Implementation safety] Are all RandStorage implementations required to be thread-safe (Send + Sync), and could non-atomic operations in implementations cause data corruption when accessed concurrently by multiple consensus threads? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Trait: RandStorage] [Error handling] Do all storage operations return anyhow::Result allowing proper error propagation, but could silent failures or unwrap() calls in calling code cause validators to crash without proper recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: new()] [Database initialization] Does RandDb::new() properly handle cases where the database path already exists with corrupted data, or will it panic with 'RandDB open failed' causing validator startup failures that could halt the entire network? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: new()] [File system attacks] Can an attacker with file system access manipulate the database files before RandDb::new() opens them, injecting malicious randomness data that gets loaded by honest validators and used in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: new()] [Column family creation] Are the three column families (KEY_PAIR_CF_NAME, AUG_DATA_CF_NAME, CERTIFIED_AUG_DATA_CF_NAME) properly isolated, or could schema mismatches allow data from one CF to be read as another type causing deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: commit()] [Write atomicity] Does commit() using write_schemas() guarantee atomic writes across multiple column families, or could partial writes during crashes leave the database in an inconsistent state with missing key pairs but present augmented data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: commit()] [Write durability] Is there fsync or similar durability guarantee after commit(), or could sudden validator crashes result in committed data being lost from the OS page cache before being written to disk? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: put()] [Concurrent write conflicts] When multiple threads call put() simultaneously for different keys, could SchemaBatch operations conflict or does each put() create a new batch, and could this lead to write amplification or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: delete()] [Batch deletion safety] Does delete() properly handle iterator failures during batch.delete(), or could partial deletions leave storage in an inconsistent state where some augmented data is deleted but not others? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: delete()] [Deletion verification] Is there verification that deleted items actually existed before deletion completes, or could delete() silently succeed for non-existent items masking bugs in the calling code? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all()] [Iterator error handling] Does get_all() properly handle iterator errors from db.iter(), or does it silently filter them with filter_map causing data loss where some persisted items are not returned? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all()] [Large result sets] Can get_all() cause memory exhaustion when retrieving thousands of augmented data entries from malicious validators who spam the storage with excessive data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key overwrite protection] When save_key_pair_bytes() is called with a new epoch, does it verify that the new epoch is greater than any existing stored epoch, or can old epoch keys overwrite newer ones causing randomness generation to use stale cryptographic material? (Critical)"
