  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Historical rewrite detection] The backwards iteration at lines 72-89 assumes version numbers decrease monotonically - if database corruption causes non-monotonic versions, can this create infinite loops or skip detecting state manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Pruned state access] If the requested version at line 73 has been pruned from the database, does get_state_value_with_version_by_version() return None or error? Can an attacker use this to detect the pruning window and infer database configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Version zero handling] At line 83-85, the code breaks when version == 0 - but line 86 computes version - 1 first, can compiler reordering or optimization cause the subtraction to execute when version is 0, creating an underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Resource key collision] At line 50, StateKey::resource() constructs a key from address and struct_tag - can two different user inputs create identical StateKeys due to case sensitivity, unicode normalization, or whitespace handling differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Generic type parameter attack] If the struct_tag at line 49 contains complex generic type parameters like 'vector<vector<vector<T>>>', can excessive recursion in StructTag::from_str() cause stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Address format confusion] AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() at line 48 expects a specific format - can attackers use short addresses ('0x1'), long addresses ('0x0000...0001'), or addresses without '0x' prefix to access different resources than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [StructTag validation bypass] After StructTag::from_str() at line 49, is the resulting struct_tag validated to ensure it references a legitimate Move resource type, or can it point to internal VM structures, table metadata, or raw storage keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [DB initialization race] At lines 52-53, databases are opened sequentially - if another process is initializing the database, can this cause corrupt reads where metadata is present but state data is missing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [LedgerDb dependency] Line 52 opens ledger_db only to get metadata at line 54-57 - is this metadata always consistent with state_kv_db opened at line 53, or can pruning/compaction cause divergence?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Read-only database access] Are the databases opened in read-only mode, or can this debugging tool accidentally write to production databases causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Missing input sanitization] The address and struct_tag fields at lines 25-28 are raw String types without validation - can extremely long strings (100MB+) cause memory exhaustion during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Struct: Cmd] [Version type overflow] The version field at line 31 is u64 - can providing u64::MAX cause integer overflow in version arithmetic at line 86 or in the underlying database query logic? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: run()] [Match arm imbalance] The match at lines 73-89 only handles None and Some cases - can get_state_value_with_version_by_version() return errors that get implicitly converted by ? operator, hiding database corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/get_value.rs] [Function: print_value()] [No return value validation] print_value() at line 94 has no return value - if println! fails due to broken pipe or disk full, is this failure silently ignored allowing incomplete debugging output?
