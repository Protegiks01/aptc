(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutateEvent] [Token collision] Can two different tokens have the same (creator, collection, token) tuple, allowing an attacker to emit mutation events that affect multiple tokens simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate_event.rs] [Function: token()] [Name collision] If token names are not enforced to be unique within a collection, can an attacker create multiple tokens with identical names and emit mutation events that indexers apply to the wrong token? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate_event.rs] [Function: keys()] [Reserved names] Can keys contain reserved property names like '__signer__', 'address', or other Move keywords that could cause namespace collisions with internal token properties? (Low)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate_event.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutateEvent] [Empty keys] Can the keys vector be empty while old_values and new_values are non-empty, creating a logical inconsistency where properties are mutated without names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate_event.rs] [Function: old_values()] [Concurrent access] If multiple threads call old_values() simultaneously while the event is being modified, can this cause data races or return inconsistent snapshots of the vector?
