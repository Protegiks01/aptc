  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Economic] [Storage Fee Evasion] Can attackers write large amounts of data to storage while producing WriteStorage entries that report zero costs and large refunds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Economic] [Event Spam] Can attackers emit millions of events with minimal EventStorage costs by exploiting event_discount calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Type Safety] [Enum Variant Confusion] Can unsafe code or transmutation be used to create ExecutionGasEvent variants with impossible combinations of fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Rust] [Lifetime Issues] Can lifetime violations in references to CallFrame structures cause use-after-free bugs when gas logs are processed across async boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Rust] [Borrow Checker Bypass] Does the code use any unsafe blocks that could bypass borrow checking and allow mutable aliasing of gas log structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Gas Meter Sync] Are the gas logs in this module always perfectly synchronized with the actual gas meter, or can desyncs occur that cause assert_consistency to falsely panic or pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Cross-Module Attack] Can attackers exploit interactions between this gas logging module and the execution VM to create gas events that are logged but not charged, or charged but not logged? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [Profiling Overhead] Does the gas profiling itself consume gas that is properly accounted, or can the overhead of creating gas logs become an attack vector for resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/log.rs] [Integration] [State Commitment] Are gas logs included in state commitment calculations, and if so, can manipulation of gas logs affect the Merkle root and cause state divergence? (Critical)"
