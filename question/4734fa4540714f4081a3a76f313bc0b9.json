  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-validator-interface/src/rest_interface.rs] [Function: get_version_by_account_sequence()] [Invalid account handling] Does the function properly handle AccountAddress::ZERO or other invalid addresses, or can querying these addresses cause unexpected REST API errors or panics?
