  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Send/Sync violations] If any of the types in EpochManager struct (lines 38-63) are not Send+Sync, can moving EpochManager across threads cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Tokio select fairness] The tokio::select! at line 128 may not be fair. Can one event stream starve others, preventing critical reconfig or DKG events from being processed timely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Unwrap panic locations] Multiple `.unwrap()` calls (lines 154, 273, 274) can panic. Are these panics intentional crash-on-critical-error patterns or potential crash exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Option combinators] Extensive use of Option<T> for channel senders (lines 48-51). Can incorrect None checks lead to missing validation or unexpected state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Channel buffer semantics] Different channels use KLAST (line 224) and FIFO (line 230) semantics. Can semantic mismatches cause messages to be processed out of order or dropped unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Drop ordering] When EpochManager is dropped, channels and senders are dropped in field order. Can incorrect drop order cause receiver tasks to panic or deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Future cancellation] If the start() function's futures (line 125) are cancelled mid-execution, can partial state updates cause inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Oneshot guarantees] Oneshot channels (lines 232, 272) guarantee single-message delivery. Can violating these guarantees by attempting multiple sends cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Cryptographic] [Key freshness] Consensus secret keys loaded at line 238-243 must be epoch-specific. Can key reuse across epochs compromise DKG security or allow key prediction attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Cryptographic] [Public key verification] Public key retrieved at line 234-237 is not explicitly verified against the secret key. Can public-private key mismatches cause DKG to generate invalid or exploitable shared keys? (Critical)"
