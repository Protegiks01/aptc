  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Timeout handling] If futures in in_progress_queue have timeouts, can expired futures block the queue and prevent newer futures from being processed during backup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Deadline violation] Can a future that takes too long to complete block the entire backup stream, causing the backup to miss its completion deadline? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Empty stream] If the stream is empty from the start, does poll_next correctly return Poll::Ready(None) immediately at line 88, or can it hang? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Single item] If the stream contains only one future and max=1, does the implementation handle this correctly without deadlocking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Immediate completion] If all futures complete immediately before the next poll, can this cause starvation or inefficient processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Struct: BufferedX] [Drop safety] When BufferedX is dropped, are all futures in in_progress_queue properly cancelled, or can they continue running and accessing freed memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Struct: BufferedX] [Resource leak] Does dropping BufferedX while futures are in-flight leak file descriptors or network connections used for backup storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Struct: BufferedX] [Panic during drop] If a future panics during the drop handler, can this cause a double panic and crash the entire backup process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: test_run()] [StreamX extension] The test uses buffered_x() method from StreamX trait - can incorrect trait implementation cause the method to be called on incompatible streams? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: test_run()] [Method resolution] Can method name conflicts between StreamExt and StreamX cause the wrong buffered implementation to be used during backup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Checksum validation] Does BufferedX perform any validation on the futures' output data, or can corrupted backup chunks pass through undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/stream/buffered_x.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Size validation] Can futures return excessively large outputs that cause memory exhaustion when buffered in the queue? (High)"
