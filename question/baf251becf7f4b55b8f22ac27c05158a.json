  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Deadlock Potential] Can nested lock acquisitions on SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR combined with locks in the underlying LocalExecutorClient or ShardedExecutorService create deadlock scenarios that permanently halt transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Non-Deterministic Execution] If multiple blocks are executed concurrently through SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR, can non-deterministic execution ordering of shard results lead to different validators computing different final state roots for the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Cross-Shard Message Ordering] Can race conditions in cross-shard message delivery within SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR cause transactions to be executed in different orders across validator nodes, breaking deterministic execution guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Remote vs Local Executor Selection] How does the system decide between using SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR versus REMOTE_SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR, and can an attacker manipulate this selection to force usage of an uninitialized or corrupted executor instance? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Execute Block Sharded Integration] When do_get_execution_output.rs calls execute_block_sharded through SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR.lock(), can exceptions or errors in transaction execution leave the mutex in an inconsistent state that affects subsequent executions? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [State View Consistency] When execute_block_sharded passes Arc<CachedStateView> to SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR, can concurrent access to the same state view from multiple execution paths cause cache inconsistencies or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Transaction Partitioning Mismatch] If PartitionedTransactions passed to SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR have a different shard count than the executor was initialized with, will the assertion in ShardedBlockExecutor::execute_block catch this, or can it lead to array bounds violations? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Improper Shutdown] Since SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR is a static variable, does it properly shut down all executor shard threads during validator shutdown, or can this lead to resource leaks and unclean termination? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Drop Implementation] Does the Drop implementation of LocalExecutorClient properly send Stop commands to all shards and wait for join handles, or can validator crashes during shutdown leave executor threads running that corrupt state on restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Static Destructor Ordering] In what order are static variables destroyed during validator shutdown, and can SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR be destroyed while other components still hold references to it, causing use-after-free conditions? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Restart Consistency] If a validator crashes and restarts, does the new SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR instance properly reinitialize with consistent shard configuration, or can configuration drift cause the restarted validator to produce different execution results? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Type Parameter Constraints] Does the CachedStateView type parameter in SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR enforce sufficient trait bounds to prevent invalid StateView implementations from being used that could bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [LocalExecutorClient Type Safety] Can the generic type parameters in ShardedBlockExecutor<CachedStateView, LocalExecutorClient<CachedStateView>> be exploited to inject malicious executor client implementations that subvert transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Non-Deterministic Shard Count] If different validators initialize SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR with different shard counts due to configuration differences, will they partition transactions differently and produce divergent execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Global Executor Randomness] Does the GlobalExecutor component within SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR introduce any non-determinism in transaction execution that could cause validators to compute different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Thread Scheduling Non-Determinism] Can variations in thread scheduling across different validator nodes executing through SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR lead to different cross-shard message delivery orders and thus different execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Aggregation Order Sensitivity] When ShardedBlockExecutor aggregates results from all shards, can variations in shard completion timing across validators lead to different transaction output orderings and state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Unwrap Panic Propagation] The code uses unwrap() in multiple places within LocalExecutorClient - if these panics occur during execution through SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR.lock(), will the mutex poisoning prevent all future block executions? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Channel Send Failures] If cross-shard channels within SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR become disconnected due to thread panics, will send().unwrap() calls cause cascading failures that crash the entire validator? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [VMStatus Error Recovery] When ShardedBlockExecutor::execute_block returns Err(VMStatus), does SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR.lock() properly release the mutex, or can error paths leave the lock held indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Result Receiver Panic] If get_output_from_shards() panics due to recv().unwrap() failures, can this permanently poison SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR and prevent transaction execution recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Malicious Transaction Injection] Can an attacker craft transactions that exploit edge cases in SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR's partitioning logic to cause transactions to be routed to incorrect shards, bypassing parallel execution safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Cross-Shard Dependency Exploitation] Can malicious transactions create circular cross-shard dependencies that deadlock SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR's execution, causing permanent network halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/local_executor_helper.rs] [Static: SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR] [Concurrency Level Manipulation] Can BlockExecutorConfigFromOnchain be manipulated to set concurrency_level_per_shard to extreme values that either exhaust SHARDED_BLOCK_EXECUTOR's thread pool or serialize execution defeating parallelism?
