  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: UnsatisfiableWaypoint] [Error recovery] Can validators recover from UnsatisfiableWaypoint errors during sync, or does this error cause permanent bootstrap failure requiring manual intervention? (High)",

  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: AdvertisedDataError] [Data availability attack] Can attackers exploit AdvertisedDataError by advertising data they don't actually have, causing validators to waste resources retrying invalid sync attempts? (Medium)",
