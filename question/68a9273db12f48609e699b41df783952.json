  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: CrossShardMsg] [Deserialization Attack] Can a malicious shard send a crafted serialized CrossShardMsg with invalid enum discriminant values that bypass serde validation, potentially causing memory corruption or type confusion when deserialized by the receiving shard? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Integer Overflow] Does the serde deserialization of CrossShardMsg properly validate size bounds, or can an attacker craft messages with extremely large serialized sizes causing integer overflow in memory allocation leading to heap corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker send a deeply nested or recursively structured RemoteTxnWrite message that causes exponential deserialization time, creating a DoS condition that halts cross-shard communication and blocks consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: state_key] [Type Confusion] During deserialization of RemoteTxnWrite, can a malicious shard send a StateKey with invalid internal structure that passes serde validation but causes panics or undefined behavior when used by the receiving shard's state view? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Deserialization Bypass] Can an attacker craft a WriteOp inside RemoteTxnWrite that deserializes successfully but contains invalid or malicious write operations (e.g., deletion masquerading as creation) that corrupt the receiving shard's state cache? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Enum: CrossShardMsg] [Variant Confusion] Is there proper validation that a deserialized CrossShardMsg enum variant matches the expected message type, or can an attacker send StopMsg disguised as RemoteTxnWriteMsg to prematurely terminate cross-shard receivers causing incomplete state updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization Side Channel] Does the serialization of CrossShardMsg leak timing information about the size or content of write_op that could allow a malicious observer to infer private transaction data or state values across shards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker send RemoteTxnWrite messages with extremely large WriteOp payloads (within serde limits) that cause memory exhaustion when accumulated in the receiving shard's CrossShardStateView, leading to OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: state_key] [Key Collision Attack] Can a Byzantine shard send multiple RemoteTxnWrite messages with duplicate state_key values but conflicting write_op values to create state inconsistencies in the receiving shard's view, potentially causing non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Invalid State Key] Does RemoteTxnWrite construction validate that state_key is a legitimate key from the sending shard's transaction dependencies, or can a malicious shard send arbitrary state keys to poison the receiving shard's cache with unauthorized writes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Function: new()] [Key Authenticity] In RemoteTxnWrite::new(), is there any validation that the provided state_key actually corresponds to a cross-shard dependency declared in the sub-block's dependency graph, or can attackers inject fake state keys that weren't part of the original transaction analysis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: state_key] [Access Control Bypass] Can a compromised shard send RemoteTxnWrite messages with state_key values pointing to system-protected resources (e.g., validator config, governance state) that the original transaction shouldn't have access to, bypassing Move's access control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Key Forgery] Since RemoteTxnWrite::new() accepts any StateKey without validation, can an attacker create messages for state keys outside their shard's assigned partition, causing writes to leak across shard boundaries and violate partitioning invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: state_key] [Merkle Path Manipulation] If StateKey contains merkle tree path information, can a malicious shard provide a state_key with manipulated path data that causes the receiving shard to update the wrong location in its Jellyfish Merkle tree? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Function: new()] [Key Duplication] Can the same StateKey be sent in multiple RemoteTxnWrite messages for the same transaction, and if so, does the receiving shard handle duplicate keys correctly or could this cause double-application of writes leading to state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Cross-Shard Key Conflict] When multiple shards send RemoteTxnWrite messages for the same state_key (if both depend on it), is there proper conflict resolution, or can this create race conditions where the last-write-wins causing non-deterministic state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [None Handling] The write_op field is Option<WriteOp> where None indicates transaction abort. Can a Byzantine shard maliciously send None for successful transactions to make dependent shards think the transaction aborted, causing incorrect execution of dependent transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Abort Inconsistency] If write_op is None (aborted transaction), but the transaction actually committed in the sending shard, can this inconsistency cause the receiving shard to have stale or missing state updates leading to divergent execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [WriteOp Type Mismatch] Can a malicious shard send a WriteOp (Creation/Modification/Deletion) that doesn't match the actual operation performed by the transaction, causing type confusion when the receiving shard applies it to its state view? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Deletion Attack] Can an attacker send a RemoteTxnWrite with write_op containing a Deletion operation for a critical state key that should never be deleted (e.g., validator stake, account resource), causing loss of funds or consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Function: new()] [WriteOp Validation] Does RemoteTxnWrite::new() validate that the write_op is consistent with the state_key's expected value type, or can attackers provide mismatched types that cause runtime errors in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Value Size Attack] Can a Byzantine shard send RemoteTxnWrite messages with write_op containing extremely large StateValue payloads (e.g., multi-GB resources) that exhaust memory in the receiving shard when stored in CrossShardStateView? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Struct: RemoteTxnWrite] [Metadata Manipulation] If WriteOp contains metadata (e.g., state value version, creator), can a malicious shard forge this metadata to make new state appear as old state, breaking snapshot consistency and state pruning logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Field: write_op] [Gas Bypass] Can a shard send write_op with operations that would have failed gas checks in the original transaction execution, allowing the receiving shard to apply writes that exceed gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/messages.rs] [Function: take()] [Write Op Consumption] The take() method consumes RemoteTxnWrite and returns write_op. If take() is called multiple times (shouldn't be possible but through unsafe code), could this allow double-spending of write operations? (Medium)"
