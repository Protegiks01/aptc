  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Type confusion] The 'votes' field is of type AccountAddress but semantically represents a Table handle - can this type aliasing lead to confusion where code incorrectly treats the table handle as a regular account address, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of voting records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Field naming] The field is named 'votes' (singular) but represents a collection (Table handle) - can this naming confusion cause developers to incorrectly assume it's a single vote rather than a table reference, leading to improper validation or access control in consuming code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing validation] Does the struct perform any validation that the AccountAddress in 'votes' is actually a valid table handle and not an arbitrary address? Can an attacker craft a malicious VotingRecords with an invalid table address causing panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Type safety] Since AccountAddress is used to represent a table handle, can code accidentally perform address operations (like balance checks, signature verification) on what is actually a table handle, leading to logic errors or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Deserialization] The struct uses #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] without custom validation - can an attacker craft malformed serialized data that deserializes successfully but contains invalid table handles, causing crashes or state corruption when accessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [BCS deserialization] When deserializing VotingRecords from BCS format (as used in get_account_resource_bcs), are there any checks to prevent integer overflows, buffer overflows, or malformed data that could cause memory safety issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Serialization determinism] Is the serialization of VotingRecords deterministic across different Rust compiler versions and platforms? Could non-deterministic serialization cause consensus failures when validators compare state hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Malicious payload] Can an attacker provide a specially crafted serialized VotingRecords that exploits serde deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., deeply nested structures, cyclic references) to cause DoS via excessive memory consumption or stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing metadata] The struct only contains the table handle but no metadata about the governance version, proposal counts, or voting power totals - can the absence of this data lead to race conditions or inconsistencies when the on-chain governance state is upgraded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Version compatibility] There is no version field in VotingRecords - when the on-chain governance module upgrades from VotingRecords to VotingRecordsV2, can this cause deserialization failures or silent data corruption in off-chain tools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing validation fields] The struct lacks fields for tracking total proposals, active proposals, or governance configuration - can this incomplete representation lead to time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities where governance state changes between reading VotingRecords and using it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [No epoch tracking] The struct doesn't include epoch or block height information - can this allow replay attacks where old VotingRecords snapshots are used to bypass updated governance rules or voting power calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Public field] The 'votes' field is declared as 'pub' - can external code directly modify this field after deserialization, allowing attackers to substitute a malicious table handle and redirect voting record queries to attacker-controlled data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [No access controls] The struct has no methods or validation logic - all access control must be enforced by consuming code. Can this lead to vulnerabilities where some code paths fail to properly validate table handle ownership or authenticity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing ownership checks] Does the struct or its consumers verify that the table handle in 'votes' is actually owned by the governance module at address 0x1? Can an attacker create a VotingRecords pointing to their own table and bypass governance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [State synchronization] When multiple threads or async tasks deserialize VotingRecords concurrently, can race conditions occur where different tasks see inconsistent table handles, leading to divergent governance state views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Cache invalidation] If VotingRecords is cached after deserialization, is there proper invalidation when the on-chain governance state updates? Can stale cached table handles lead to reading outdated voting records or missing new proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [TOCTOU vulnerabilities] Between deserializing VotingRecords and using the table handle to query voting data, can the on-chain state change (e.g., governance reconfiguration), causing the table handle to become invalid or point to incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Move interop] When deserializing the Move VotingRecords resource which contains a Table<RecordKey, bool>, does the Rust struct correctly represent the table's type parameters? Can type mismatches cause incorrect data interpretation or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Table handle validity] The struct assumes the table handle is valid, but if the on-chain governance module deletes or destroys the table, can queries using this handle cause panics, crashes, or undefined behavior in the API server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Resource migration] When governance upgrades from VotingRecords to VotingRecordsV2 on-chain, does the Rust struct handle both versions gracefully? Can attempting to deserialize VotingRecordsV2 data using the VotingRecords struct cause silent data loss or corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Type parameter mismatch] The on-chain Table has specific key (RecordKey) and value (bool) types - if the Rust code attempts to query the table with wrong type tags, can this cause type confusion vulnerabilities or allow reading arbitrary memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Memory leaks] If VotingRecords is cloned repeatedly in long-running processes without being dropped, can this cause memory leaks since AccountAddress may hold heap-allocated data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Clone semantics] The struct derives Debug but not Clone - if code attempts to clone it using manual field copying, can this lead to double-free or use-after-free if AccountAddress contains interior mutability or references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing error handling] The struct has no methods, so all error handling is in consuming code - can this lead to inconsistent error handling where some code paths panic on invalid table handles while others return errors, causing non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)"
