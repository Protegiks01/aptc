  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Enum: PeerStateValue] [Clone safety] Does Clone on PeerStateValue properly deep-copy all internal state including RequestTracker Arc references, or could shared mutable state lead to monitoring corruption across cloned instances?
