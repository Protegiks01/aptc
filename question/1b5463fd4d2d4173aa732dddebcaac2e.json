  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_code()] [Address enumeration gap] Lines 225-227 check ONE, THREE, FOUR but not TWO—is address TWO used for system code, and if so, does this omission allow unauthorized code access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_code()] [Address constant mutation] If AccountAddress::ONE/THREE/FOUR values change in updates, can old state keys with outdated system address checks grant wrong privileges? (Medium)",
