  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Verification Impact] [Spec Function Substitution] If a malicious spec function is mapped as an intrinsic, can it provide false proofs during formal verification, allowing vulnerable code to be marked as verified? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Verification Impact] [Intrinsic Soundness] Can intrinsic declarations break the soundness of Move's formal verification system by allowing unverifiable operations to be treated as verified? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Combined Attack] [Type Confusion + Missing Validation] Can an attacker combine the missing type signature checking (lines 190, 232) with symbol manipulation to map a malicious function that accepts APT tokens to an intrinsic that should transfer them, enabling theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Combined Attack] [Race Condition + Map Desync] Can concurrent calls to add_decl() combined with lookups cause TOCTOU bugs where one thread reads partially constructed intrinsic data while another writes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/intrinsics.rs] [Deep Technical] [Loc Usage] The Loc parameter in process_intrinsic_declaration() and populate_intrinsic_decl() is used for error reporting - can manipulated Loc values cause errors to be attributed to wrong source locations, confusing security audits? (Low)",
