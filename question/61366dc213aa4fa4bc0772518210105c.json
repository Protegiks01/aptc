  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Error handling] When recv() returns an error, the function logs and returns immediately - can this cause message loss for other pending messages in other receivers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Shutdown race] Can concurrent shutdown and message sending cause the function to return while messages are in-flight, losing critical consensus votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Stop task bypass] Can an attacker send messages with message_type 'stop_task' through normal channels to prematurely terminate the outbound handler and break network connectivity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [String comparison] Does comparing message_type.get_type() == 'stop_task' use constant-time comparison, or can timing attacks determine when stop signals are being processed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Self-messaging race] When remote_addr == socket_addr, does acquiring inbound_handler.lock().unwrap() block the entire outbound loop if the inbound handler is processing slowly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Mutex poisoning] If inbound_handler.lock().unwrap() panics due to a poisoned mutex, does the entire outbound handler crash, causing total loss of network connectivity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Self-message validation] Can self-messaging be exploited to bypass network authentication checks that would normally occur in GRPC communication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [GRPC client lookup] Does grpc_clients.get_mut(remote_addr).unwrap() panic if remote_addr was not in the original remote_addresses set, causing handler crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Message ordering] Can out-of-order message delivery occur if GRPC send_message() operations complete in different orders than they were initiated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Async await point] Does the await point at send_message() allow other tasks to interleave, potentially causing message reordering that violates consensus assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Send failure handling] If send_message() fails silently or returns an error, are messages lost without retry, causing consensus votes to never arrive? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Struct: OutboundHandler] [HashMap collision] Can an attacker craft SocketAddr values that cause hash collisions in the grpc_clients HashMap, degrading lookup performance and causing message delays? (Medium)",
