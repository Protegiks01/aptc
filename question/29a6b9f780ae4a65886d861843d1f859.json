  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Sync] [Incomplete sync] If a new validator syncs its database and receives only partial EpochByVersionSchema data (missing some epoch boundaries), can it detect the incompleteness and refuse to participate in consensus, or would it silently use wrong epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Sync] [Malicious peer data] Can a Byzantine peer send corrupted epoch boundary data during state sync that encodes correctly per the schema but contains semantically invalid epoch mappings (e.g., epochs going backwards), causing the syncing node to build inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Sync] [Epoch boundary verification] After syncing EpochByVersionSchema data, does the node verify that epoch boundaries align with LedgerInfo epoch markers, or could mismatches between these two sources cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Cryptography] [No authentication] Does the schema include any authentication (e.g., signatures or MACs) of epoch boundary data, or can an attacker with RocksDB write access forge arbitrary epoch boundaries without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Cryptography] [No encryption] Is epoch boundary data stored in plaintext in RocksDB, potentially exposing epoch transition patterns to attackers who gain read access to the database files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Cryptography] [Deterministic encoding observable] Since to_be_bytes() produces deterministic output, can attackers observe RocksDB write patterns to infer when epoch transitions occur, enabling timing attacks against consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [Vec allocation] Can repeated calls to to_vec() in encode_key() and encode_value() exhaust heap memory during mass epoch writes, causing OOM panics that crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [Slice lifetime] Does the mutable slice reference 'data: &[u8]' in decode_key() and decode_value() have guaranteed lifetime, or could the underlying buffer be freed while read_u64() is reading, causing use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Memory safety] [Buffer reuse] If the byte buffer passed to decode_key() is reused across multiple decode operations, could stale data from previous decodes leak into subsequent reads, causing epoch confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [RocksDB] [Compaction corruption] If RocksDB compaction runs while epoch boundaries are being written, can compaction merge or discard records incorrectly, causing loss of epoch boundary data and breaking epoch lookups? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [RocksDB] [Snapshot isolation] When reading epoch boundaries via RocksDB snapshots, can readers observe stale epoch data from before recent writes, causing validators to use outdated epochs during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [RocksDB] [WAL corruption] If RocksDB's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is corrupted before epoch boundary writes are flushed to disk, can recovery lose recent epoch records, causing validators to revert to earlier epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [RocksDB] [Column family deletion] If the EPOCH_BY_VERSION_CF_NAME column family is accidentally deleted or dropped, does the system detect the missing schema and halt safely, or continue with broken epoch logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [RocksDB] [Key prefix bloom filter] Does RocksDB's bloom filter configuration for this column family correctly handle BigEndian-encoded version keys, or could filter false negatives cause seek_for_prev() to miss existing epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Consensus impact] [Validator set confusion] If epoch boundary corruption causes different validators to compute different epochs for the same version, can this lead to validators using different validator sets for the same block, breaking consensus quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Consensus impact] [Epoch fork attack] Can an attacker manipulate epoch boundaries to cause a chain fork where some validators believe epoch N has ended while others believe it continues, splitting the network into incompatible partitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Consensus impact] [Reconfiguration bypass] If epoch boundary records are deleted or corrupted, can validators miss reconfiguration events and continue using stale validator sets, allowing removed validators to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Consensus impact] [Safety rule violation] Can incorrect epoch boundaries cause validators to sign blocks from different epochs with the same keys, violating safety rules and enabling double-signing attacks that break AptosBFT guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Consensus impact] [Liveness failure] If all validators have corrupted or missing epoch boundary data and cannot agree on the current epoch, can this cause total loss of liveness where no blocks can be committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Type safety] [Version type aliasing] Is Version a distinct type or just a type alias for u64, and if it's an alias, could type confusion allow attackers to pass arbitrary u64 values as versions without semantic validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Type safety] [Trait implementation uniqueness] Are the KeyCodec and ValueCodec implementations for this schema unique, or could overlapping implementations cause dispatch ambiguity where wrong encode/decode functions are called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Rust safety] [Unsafe code] Does the schema or its dependencies use any unsafe blocks that could violate Rust's memory safety guarantees, potentially allowing buffer overflows or use-after-free in epoch data handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Rust safety] [Integer conversion] Do the conversions between Version (u64) and bytes involve any unchecked casts or transmutes that could cause undefined behavior if Version's internal representation changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Testing gap] [Property-based test coverage] The test module uses proptest for encode/decode verification, but does it test boundary conditions like u64::MAX, version 0, epoch 0, and consecutive epochs to ensure no overflow or collision issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/epoch_by_version/mod.rs] [Testing gap] [Fuzzing coverage] While test_no_panic_decoding prevents panics, does fuzzing also verify that decoded values are semantically valid epochs (e.g., not producing epochs that jump backwards)? (Medium)"
