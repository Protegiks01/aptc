  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/write_op_converter.rs] [Function: convert_aggregator] [Generated function] Line 58 generates convert_aggregator function via macro - can the generated code have different semantics than handwritten equivalents, introducing subtle bugs? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/write_op_converter.rs] [General: Error propagation] All functions return PartialVMResult - can error suppression or improper error handling in callers hide critical state corruption issues? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/write_op_converter.rs] [General: Memory safety] The code uses Bytes, BTreeMap, and Arc types - can memory leaks or excessive allocations in conversion cause validator memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
