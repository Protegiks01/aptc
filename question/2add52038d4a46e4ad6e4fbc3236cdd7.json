  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Connection Storm] Rapid retries call get_grpc_manager_client_for_request() (line 28-30) with no rate limiting - can this cause a connection storm to the backend, overwhelming the gRPC server or network infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Goroutine Leak] Each fetch_transactions() call spawns an async task that may loop forever - can many concurrent calls exhaust the async runtime's task limit, preventing new legitimate requests from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Infinite Loop Condition] The loop has no break condition except successful version match - can this create a logical deadlock if the gRPC server's version number never reaches starting_version due to reorgs or pruning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Version Regression] If the server returns transactions with version < starting_version after a reorg, the code silently retries - can this cause the indexer to be stuck in an infinite loop during chain reorganizations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Livelock] If get_grpc_manager_client_for_request() and get_transactions() both fail intermittently at exactly the wrong timing, can the system enter a livelock state where it's constantly retrying but never making progress? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Monitoring Gap] Only successful fetches are traced (line 19), failed attempts are silent - can attackers exploit this blind spot to launch attacks that go undetected until catastrophic failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [No Metrics] There are no metrics for retry counts, latency, or error rates - can degraded performance or attacks go unnoticed, preventing timely incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Silent Version Mismatch] When version doesn't match (line 37-38), the retry is completely silent - can systematic version mismatch attacks persist for long periods without being detected in logs or alerts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Untrusted Input] The Transaction objects (line 33) from gRPC are trusted without validation - can maliciously crafted protobuf messages exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in the aptos_protos library? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Trust Model Violation] The code implicitly trusts the gRPC server as authoritative - can a compromised or Byzantine node in the validator set serve malicious data through this interface? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Struct: DataClient] [Privilege Escalation] The DataClient (line 9-11) has no capability or permission checks - can low-privilege components instantiate DataClient to access sensitive blockchain data they shouldn't have permission to read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Reorg Handling] There's no handling for blockchain reorganizations - can chain reorgs cause the indexer to index orphaned transactions as canonical, corrupting the indexed state permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Finality Violation] Transactions are indexed without checking if they're finalized by AptosBFT consensus - can unfinalized or reverted transactions be indexed as final, showing incorrect balances to users? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Fork Choice Rule] The code has no fork choice logic when multiple transaction batches are available - can this lead to indexing transactions from a minority fork instead of the canonical chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Epoch Boundary] There's no special handling for epoch boundaries in Aptos - can epoch transitions with validator set changes cause version numbering inconsistencies that break the indexer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Protobuf Size Limits] The response.into_inner() (line 33) may not respect protobuf message size limits - can an attacker send a response claiming to be within limits but with nested structures that expand to gigabytes during parsing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Malformed Protobuf] Transaction deserialization doesn't check for required fields - can malformed protobuf messages with missing required fields cause undefined behavior or incorrect indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Protobuf Injection] The GetTransactionsRequest (line 21-26) uses Some() wrappers for optional fields - can carefully crafted None values be interpreted differently by different protobuf implementations, causing inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Client Reuse] A new client is obtained every loop iteration (line 28-30) - can this defeat connection pooling optimizations, causing excessive TCP handshakes and degrading performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Connection State] The code doesn't check if the client is in a healthy state before use - can calling get_transactions() on a half-closed or error state connection cause protocol violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Struct: DataClient] [Shared State] The Arc<ConnectionManager> (line 10) is shared across all DataClient instances - can concurrent access patterns cause connection manager internal state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Version Zero Handling] No special handling for starting_version = 0 (genesis) - can this cause issues if the gRPC server has different genesis block semantics or pruned early history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [U64 Maximum] What happens if starting_version is u64::MAX - can this cause overflow in version comparisons or make it impossible to fetch the last transaction in the chain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Empty Chain State] If the blockchain has no transactions yet (version 0 with empty state), can the return of empty vec (line 35) be misinterpreted as an error rather than valid empty state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/live_data_service/data_client.rs] [Function: fetch_transactions()] [Historical Data] The code doesn't check if starting_version refers to pruned historical data - can requests for ancient transactions cause undefined behavior or return incorrect results? (Medium)"
