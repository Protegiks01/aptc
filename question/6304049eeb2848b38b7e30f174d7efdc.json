  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Partial Read State] If the file is being written while read_to_string() executes, can partial/torn reads occur resulting in invalid YAML that gets propagated as peer updates? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [State Rollback] If a new PeerSet is loaded but fails validation downstream, is there a mechanism to rollback to the previous known-good PeerSet, or do validators get stuck with invalid configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Encoding Attacks] Does the file reading assume UTF-8 encoding, or can attackers use different encodings (UTF-16, Latin-1) to bypass parsing or inject unexpected characters? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Silent Failures] Are successful peer updates and errors properly logged/metered, or can the discovery system silently fail without alerting operators to configuration issues? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Audit Trail] Is there audit logging for file access attempts, successful reads, and peer set changes to detect unauthorized modifications or tampering? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Missing Signature Verification] Does the file-based peer discovery validate cryptographic signatures on the YAML file to ensure it hasn't been tampered with by unauthorized parties? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Peer Key Validation] After deserializing PeerSet, are the cryptographic keys (noise keys, handshake keys) validated for format, strength, and authenticity before being used for network connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay an old valid YAML file to restore a previously valid but now malicious peer set, reverting peer discovery to a compromised state? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: write_peer_set()] [Test Function in Production] Is the write_peer_set() test helper function accidentally exposed or callable in production builds, allowing unauthorized modification of peer configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: create_listener()] [Test Mock Leakage] Does the test code using NetworkContext::mock() properly isolate from production code, or can mock contexts leak into production builds compromising security assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [World-Readable File] If the configuration file has overly permissive permissions (644 or 666), can unprivileged users on the system read peer information and network topology? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Directory Traversal] If file_path is a directory instead of a file, does load_file() fail safely or can this cause unexpected behavior in read_to_string()? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Sybil Attack via File] Can an attacker control the peer configuration file to inject numerous attacker-controlled peer identities, executing a Sybil attack on the validator's peer connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Eclipse Attack] Can complete replacement of the PeerSet with only malicious peers eclipse the validator from the honest network, allowing consensus attacks or double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Peer Role Manipulation] Can an attacker modify peer roles (Upstream, Downstream, Validator) in the YAML to elevate privileges of malicious peers or demote legitimate validators? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Duration Overflow] Can extremely large interval_duration values (near Duration::MAX) cause overflow in time calculations or prevent the interval from ever triggering? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Interval Precision Loss] Can sub-millisecond interval_duration values lose precision in the TimeService implementation, causing intervals to fire at unexpected rates? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Connectivity Manager Overload] If the connectivity manager is slow or blocked, can the Stream implementation continue queueing UpdateDiscoveredPeers messages indefinitely causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Discovery Source Conflicts] If multiple discovery sources (file, on-chain, DHT) provide conflicting peer information, how is precedence determined and can this be exploited to inject malicious peers? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Error Type Confusion] Can DiscoveryError::IO and DiscoveryError::Parsing be distinguished by downstream consumers, or does error type confusion cause inappropriate error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Panic vs Error] Are all possible error conditions properly converted to Result<>, or can unexpected panics bypass error handling and crash the discovery task? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Noise Protocol Key Validation] Does PeerSet deserialization validate that noise-ik keys are valid public keys with proper formatting, or can malformed keys cause crashes in the noise protocol handshake? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Port Number Validation] Are peer port numbers validated to be in valid range (1-65535) and not reserved/privileged ports, preventing connection to system services? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [IPv6 Address Handling] Does the NetworkAddress parsing correctly handle IPv6 addresses including zone identifiers, or can malformed IPv6 addresses cause parsing errors or connection failures? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Stream Termination] Does the Stream ever return Poll::Ready(None) to signal termination, or does it poll indefinitely even when the discovery system should shut down? (Medium)"
