  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Channel exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the self-message channel to cause PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES to grow unbounded, potentially causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes when the channel capacity is exceeded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Observability blind spot] Does the PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES counter properly detect when the channel becomes full, or can Byzantine validators exploit unmonitored channel saturation to silently drop JWK consensus messages causing consensus failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Race condition] Is the PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES gauge updated atomically with channel operations, or can race conditions cause metric drift where the reported count diverges from actual pending messages, hiding channel saturation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Integer overflow] Can the PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES counter overflow if message accumulation exceeds i64::MAX, potentially wrapping to negative values and creating false metrics that hide actual channel exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Liveness monitoring] Does the system have alerting thresholds on PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES to detect abnormal message accumulation, or can Byzantine validators cause slow consensus degradation without triggering monitoring alerts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Channel capacity mismatch] The channel is initialized with capacity 1024 - can an attacker exploit the gap between when PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES approaches 1024 and when backpressure occurs to inject malicious messages that bypass rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES] [Metric injection] Can external entities manipulate the PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES gauge through metric exposition endpoints, potentially causing false alarms or hiding real attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Label injection] Can an attacker control the 'issuer' label value in OBSERVATION_SECONDS histogram to inject malicious label values, potentially causing metric cardinality explosion and memory exhaustion on monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Timing attack] Can Byzantine validators analyze OBSERVATION_SECONDS histogram distributions to infer which validators observed which JWK updates first, potentially enabling timing attacks or network topology mapping? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Result manipulation] Does the 'result' label in OBSERVATION_SECONDS properly distinguish between different error types, or can attackers cause authentication to fail silently by manipulating errors to appear as normal observations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Histogram bucket overflow] Can extremely long observation times (e.g., >1 hour due to DoS) cause OBSERVATION_SECONDS histogram buckets to overflow or skew, hiding critical performance degradation from monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Cardinality explosion] If the issuer label is unbounded, can an attacker register unlimited OIDC providers to create unbounded histogram series, causing memory exhaustion through metric cardinality explosion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Missing authentication metrics] Does OBSERVATION_SECONDS track failed authentication attempts separately from network errors, or can attackers hide brute-force JWK authentication attacks by making them appear as normal network failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Observability gap] Are there sufficient metrics to detect when JWK observations are being tampered with in-flight, or is OBSERVATION_SECONDS only measuring timing without validating observation integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric: OBSERVATION_SECONDS] [Concurrent access safety] Is the OBSERVATION_SECONDS histogram thread-safe when multiple JWKObserver instances observe different issuers concurrently, or can race conditions corrupt histogram data causing false monitoring alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Registration: register_int_gauge] [Initialization failure] What happens if register_int_gauge() fails during PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES initialization - does unwrap() cause validator panic at startup, potentially preventing the entire JWK consensus subsystem from starting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Registration: register_histogram_vec] [Initialization failure] What happens if register_histogram_vec() fails during OBSERVATION_SECONDS initialization - does unwrap() cause validator panic, potentially making validators unable to participate in JWK consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Global state: Lazy] [Race condition] Are the Lazy-initialized metrics thread-safe during concurrent initialization, or can multiple threads calling these metrics simultaneously cause double-registration or initialization races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Global state: Lazy] [Memory leak] Do these Lazy static metrics get properly cleaned up on node shutdown, or can repeated restarts in testing environments cause metric registry accumulation leading to memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric naming] [Name collision] Could the metric name 'aptos_jwk_consensus_pending_self_messages' collide with other subsystem metrics, potentially causing metric confusion or allowing one subsystem to manipulate another's metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Metric naming] [Name collision] Could the metric name 'aptos_jwk_observation_seconds' collide with other subsystem metrics or be confused with consensus observation metrics, hiding security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Byzantine detection] Is there a counter for detecting Byzantine behavior in JWK consensus (e.g., validators sending conflicting observations), or does the absence of such metrics make Byzantine attacks undetectable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/counters.rs] [Missing metric] [Signature validation] Is there a counter for JWK signature validation failures, or can attackers send invalid signatures without detection in monitoring systems? (Medium)",
