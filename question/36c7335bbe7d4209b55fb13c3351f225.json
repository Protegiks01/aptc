  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Invalid curve point] Can an attacker provide serialized bytes representing a point not on the BLS12-381 curve that passes through g2_proj_from_bytes validation, allowing injection of an invalid dealt public key that could break PVSS reconstruction security guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Point-at-infinity attack] Does the deserialization via g2_proj_from_bytes properly reject the point-at-infinity (identity element), or can an attacker inject identity elements as dealt public keys that would neutralize secret shares during DKG reconstruction, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Subgroup membership] Does g2_proj_from_bytes verify prime-order subgroup membership, or can an attacker provide points in a small-order subgroup of G2 that pass validation but enable small-subgroup attacks on the PVSS protocol, compromising distributed key generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Compression format exploitation] Can an attacker craft ambiguous compressed point representations that deserialize differently across validator nodes, causing validators to compute different dealt public keys from the same transcript bytes, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Length validation bypass] Does the slice length check in try_from properly handle edge cases where bytes.len() < DEALT_PK_NUM_BYTES but casting succeeds due to undefined behavior, allowing truncated or padded malformed points to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Error propagation] Does try_from properly propagate all CryptoMaterialError variants from g2_proj_from_bytes, or could certain error conditions be silently ignored, allowing invalid points to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Type confusion] Since the macro generates identical DealtPubKey structs for g1::DealtPubKey and g2::DealtPubKey, can an attacker cause type confusion by substituting a G1 point where G2 is expected in PVSS transcripts, breaking cryptographic security assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Serialization determinism] Does to_compressed() produce deterministic canonical compressed representations, or could the same dealt public key serialize to different byte arrays across validator nodes, causing transcript verification to fail inconsistently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Roundtrip consistency] Is there a guarantee that DealtPubKey::try_from(&dealt_pk.to_bytes()) always succeeds and returns an equivalent point, or could serialization-deserialization roundtrips fail for edge cases like points with unusual coordinate representations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Macro: dealt_pub_key_impl!] [Macro hygiene] Could the macro expansion create name collisions or capture external identifiers in unexpected ways, leading to compilation with wrong types or functions when instantiated in different modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: new()] [Unchecked group element] Does new() perform any validation on the provided GTProjective parameter, or can an attacker construct a DealtPubKey wrapping an invalid/malicious group element that bypasses all validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: as_group_element()] [Direct element access] Does exposing direct reference access to the internal g_a group element via as_group_element() enable attackers to perform unsafe operations or extract sensitive information from the dealt public key structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Clone safety] Since DealtPubKey implements Clone, could deep copying of group elements introduce timing side channels or enable race conditions when the same dealt public key is used concurrently across multiple transcript verifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Empty AIP_80_PREFIX] Why is AIP_80_PREFIX set to empty string, and does this make DealtPubKey incompatible with Aptos's standard key derivation/validation schemes, potentially causing issues in higher-level protocol integration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: to_bytes() in ValidCryptoMaterial] [Vector allocation] Does converting the fixed-size array to Vec via to_bytes().to_vec() introduce unnecessary allocations that could be exploited for memory exhaustion attacks when processing many transcripts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Module: g2] [Missing g1 implementation] The g1 module instantiation is commented out - could enabling both g1 and g2 simultaneously cause type confusion in protocols that mix both group types, leading to cryptographic security violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Constant: DEALT_PK_NUM_BYTES] [Size mismatch] If DEALT_PK_NUM_BYTES doesn't match the actual compressed point size from blstrs, could this cause buffer overflows, truncation, or padding issues during serialization/deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Consensus divergence] If different validator nodes use different versions of blstrs with different validation rules in g2_proj_from_bytes, could the same transcript bytes be accepted by some validators and rejected by others, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Equality implementation] Does the PartialEq/Eq implementation properly handle all edge cases of group element equality (e.g., equivalent points in different coordinate representations), or could validators disagree on whether two dealt public keys are equal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Derive: SerializeKey/DeserializeKey] [Serde consistency] Do the derived SerializeKey and DeserializeKey implementations produce the same binary format as the manual to_bytes/try_from implementations, or could serde-based and manual serialization paths diverge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Field element representation] The comment describes g_a as g^a, but does the implementation enforce that this is actually a valid exponentiation result, or could arbitrary group elements be used that don't follow this structure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: new()] [Secret leakage] When constructing DealtPubKey with new(), could the group element parameter leak information about the dealt secret key 'a' through timing or memory access patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Constant-time operations] Does to_compressed() execute in constant time regardless of the point coordinates, or could timing variations leak information about the dealt secret through side-channel analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Timing attacks] Does g2_proj_from_bytes validation execute in constant time, or do different rejection paths (wrong length vs invalid point vs wrong subgroup) create timing side channels that leak information about the dealt key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Debug trait exposure] Does the Debug trait implementation expose the full group element coordinates in logs/error messages, potentially leaking sensitive information about dealt secrets in production environments?
