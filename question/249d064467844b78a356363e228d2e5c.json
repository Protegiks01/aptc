  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_poll_time] [Negative Duration] Although Duration cannot be negative, can Duration::ZERO or very small durations (<1ms) cause busy-waiting or excessive CPU consumption in the polling loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: All Numeric Fields] [Boundary Values] Have all numeric fields (max_txns_after_filtering, soft_max_txns_after_filtering, pending_uncommitted_blocks, minimum_batch_age_usecs) been tested at boundary values (0, 1, MAX-1, MAX)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: max_txns and max_inline_txns] [PayloadTxnsSize Boundaries] Have edge cases where max_txns or max_inline_txns use PayloadTxnsSize boundary values (zero, count=bytes, count<<bytes, count=u64::MAX) been tested for consensus safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: recent_max_fill_fraction] [Denormal Numbers] Can recent_max_fill_fraction become a denormal floating point number (very close to zero), causing unexpected comparison results in threshold checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: recent_max_fill_fraction] [Rounding Direction] Can differences in floating point rounding modes across validator architectures cause different validators to round recent_max_fill_fraction differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter with DirectMempool] [Vector Size] Can PayloadFilter::DirectMempool contain a Vec with billions of TransactionSummary entries causing memory allocation failures or OOM kills? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter with InQuorumStore] [HashSet Size] Can PayloadFilter::InQuorumStore contain a HashSet with millions of BatchInfoExt entries causing hash computation overhead and timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Trait: Clone on OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Lifetime Issues] When OptQSPayloadPullParams is cloned and the original is dropped, can this invalidate references held by the clone (if any interior mutability exists)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: PayloadPullParameters] [Move Semantics] When PayloadPullParameters is moved into async blocks, can the move invalidate borrowed references used elsewhere in proposal generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: Network Layer] [Parameter Injection] Can network messages carrying payload requests inject malicious PayloadPullParameters that override locally-computed safe values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: Mempool] [Filter Injection] Can a compromised mempool provide malicious PayloadFilter values that cause incorrect transaction exclusion or inclusion? (High)"
