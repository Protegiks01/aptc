  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [Environment Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the INDEXER_DATABASE_URL environment variable at runtime to bypass test protections or cause the indexer to connect to a malicious database, potentially leading to data corruption or information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [Logic Error] Does the function properly handle race conditions where INDEXER_DATABASE_URL or CIRCLECI environment variables are modified between the .is_ok() check and the subsequent .expect() call, potentially causing a panic in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [Panic Safety] In CI environments (line 27), does the .expect() call on INDEXER_DATABASE_URL create a denial-of-service vector where missing configuration causes indexer service crashes instead of graceful degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [Information Disclosure] Can the aptos_logger::warn! message on line 32 leak sensitive information about the indexer's configuration state to unauthorized parties through log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [Test Bypass] Can malicious actors set INDEXER_DATABASE_URL to an empty string or invalid value that passes the .is_ok() check but causes undefined behavior in actual database operations, bypassing security tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Function: should_skip_pg_tests()] [CI Security] Does the CIRCLECI environment variable check create a security assumption that production environments will never have this variable set, potentially causing unexpected behavior if attackers set it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Macro: recursion_limit] [Stack Overflow] Can the recursion_limit of 256 on line 5 be exploited through deeply nested serde_json::json! macro calls in the database, models, or processors modules to cause stack overflow and crash the indexer service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Macro: diesel_migrations] [SQL Injection] Do the diesel_migrations macros on line 8 properly sanitize migration file names and SQL content, or can an attacker with access to the migrations directory inject malicious SQL that executes during indexer startup? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Macro: diesel] [Code Generation] Does the diesel macro usage on line 12 generate code with proper bounds checking and SQL parameterization, or can it produce vulnerable query builders that allow SQL injection in the schema module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Macro: diesel_migrations] [Migration Tampering] Can an attacker modify migration files referenced by the diesel_migrations macro to corrupt the indexer database schema, causing state inconsistencies that affect transaction indexing accuracy? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: database] [Access Control] Does the public database module (line 15) expose database connection pools or credentials that could be accessed by untrusted code in the same process, leading to unauthorized database access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: indexer] [Attack Surface] Does the public indexer module (line 16) expose internal indexing APIs that could be called by malicious actors to manipulate indexing state or cause inconsistencies with the blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: models] [Data Integrity] Can the public models module (line 17) be exploited to create malformed database models that bypass validation when inserted, leading to corrupted indexer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: processors] [Processing Bypass] Does the public processors module (line 18) allow external code to register malicious transaction processors that could manipulate indexed data or skip critical validation steps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: runtime] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the public runtime module (line 19) be exploited to spawn unlimited async tasks or allocate excessive resources, causing denial of service to the indexer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: schema] [Schema Injection] Does the public schema module (line 20) allow external modification of database schema definitions, potentially enabling attackers to corrupt the indexer's data model? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module: util] [Utility Exploitation] Are utility functions in the private util module (line 21) properly isolated, or can they be indirectly invoked through public module APIs to bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module Integration] [Connection Pool] Does the combination of diesel macros and the database module create opportunities for connection pool exhaustion attacks where malicious queries hold connections indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Module Integration] [Transaction Safety] Are database transactions properly isolated across the indexer, models, and processors modules, or can race conditions cause non-atomic updates to indexed blockchain state? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Build Security] [Macro Expansion] During compilation, can the diesel macro on line 12 be exploited through malicious schema.rs content (which is autogenerated) to inject unsafe code into the compiled binary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Build Security] [Recursion Limit] Does setting the recursion_limit to 256 open up opportunities for compile-time resource exhaustion attacks through maliciously crafted source files in the sub-modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Module Coupling] Can circular dependencies between the public modules (counters, database, indexer, models, processors, runtime, schema) create deadlock scenarios or allow attackers to trigger undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Error Propagation] If errors occur in sub-modules, are they properly propagated through this lib.rs entry point, or can error swallowing hide security-critical failures? (Medium)",
