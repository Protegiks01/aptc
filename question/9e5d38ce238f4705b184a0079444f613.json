  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Module: thread_pool] [Thread exhaustion] The thread_pool module is not publicly exported but likely used internally - can attackers trigger scenarios that exhaust the thread pool, preventing legitimate transaction processing and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Testing: fuzzing feature] [Production exposure] The code conditionally exports fuzzing and mocks under test/fuzzing features - can these test utilities accidentally be enabled in production builds, exposing dangerous testing interfaces to attackers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Testing: mocks module] [Mock injection] The mocks module is exported under test feature - are there scenarios where mock implementations could be substituted for real ones in production, bypassing security checks or validation logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Safety: forbid(unsafe_code)] [Unsafe bypass] The file has #![forbid(unsafe_code)] - but can dependencies or linked modules use unsafe code that violates memory safety, potentially causing crashes or exploitable memory corruption in mempool operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Concurrency: Arc/Mutex usage] [Deadlock] Based on the architecture, mempool likely uses Arc/Mutex for concurrent access - are there potential deadlock scenarios where consensus pulling, network sync, and client submissions could lock in circular dependencies, halting all mempool operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Concurrency: async/await] [Panic propagation] With recursion_limit increased to 1024 for select! macros, can deeply nested async operations cause stack overflows or panics that crash the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Consensus boundary] [Transaction replay] Since Consensus pulls transactions and notifies mempool of commits - can timing issues cause a transaction to be committed in Consensus but not properly removed from mempool, leading to replay attempts and state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Network boundary] [Sync desynchronization] When mempool shares transactions across the network, can Byzantine validators send conflicting sync messages that desynchronize honest nodes' mempools, causing different validators to propose different transaction sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Storage boundary] [State divergence] If storage (db) provides stale sequence numbers due to caching or replication lag, can mempool accept transactions that should be rejected, causing divergent mempool states across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Integration: VM Validator boundary] [Validation bypass] The validator module validates transactions before insertion - can race conditions allow transactions to enter mempool after validation but before the validation state becomes stale, bypassing crucial security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Economics: Gas price ordering] [MEV extraction] Since transactions are ordered by gas price in PriorityIndex, can validators or MEV bots exploit this deterministic ordering to extract maximum value from transaction reordering, harming users and DeFi protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Economics: Transaction replacement] [Gas auction attack] If mempool allows transaction replacement with higher gas (not documented), can attackers continuously replace transactions to monopolize block space and prevent others from transacting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Economics: Fee market] [Market manipulation] Can wealthy attackers manipulate the gas price market by submitting and withdrawing high-gas transactions, causing fee volatility and making the network unusable for regular users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: SystemTTL vs Client Expiration] [Timing vulnerability] The documentation distinguishes between system TTL (periodic check) and client expiration (checked on commit) - can attackers exploit the gap between these two mechanisms to keep transactions alive beyond intended lifetimes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: Consensus agnostic design] [Branch confusion] Documentation states mempool is 'agnostic about different Consensus proposal branches' - can this lead to situations where mempool serves the same transaction to multiple competing branches, causing resource waste or state confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: Batching for performance] [Batch size manipulation] The documentation mentions batching transactions into consensus blocks - are there limits on batch sizes that prevent malicious consensus from requesting excessively large or small batches to manipulate throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Error: Channel communication] [Message loss] The API uses oneshot and mpsc channels for communication - can message loss or channel closure cause transactions to be silently dropped, lost confirmations, or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Error: Subscriber notifications] [Notification flood] The subscribers vector sends notifications for mempool events - can rapid transaction submissions trigger notification floods that overwhelm subscribers and cause cascading failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Empty mempool] [Consensus starvation] When mempool is empty, how does Consensus handle get_batch requests - can improper handling cause consensus to stall or make progress without transactions when there should be some? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Edge case: Full mempool] [Admission control failure] When mempool reaches capacity, how are new transactions handled - can priority transactions be rejected while lower-priority ones remain, violating expected ordering guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Bootstrap: initialization] [State recovery] The bootstrap function is exported - during node restart or recovery, can mempool's state become inconsistent with storage, leading to duplicate or missing transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Bootstrap: network discovery] [Peer trust] During bootstrap, how does mempool establish trust with peers - can a malicious peer inject invalid transactions during the initial sync phase before validation is fully active? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Design: Transaction uniqueness] [Hash collision] How does mempool ensure transaction uniqueness - if using transaction hashes, can hash collisions (even with cryptographic hashes) cause legitimate transactions to be rejected as duplicates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Design: Broadcast eligibility] [Starvation attack] The documentation states only sequential transactions are broadcast - can an attacker deliberately submit a transaction with sequence N and withhold transaction N-1, preventing account N's transactions from ever being broadcast and causing permanent censorship? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Design: Multi-sender coordination] [Coordination failure] When multiple senders share mempool state across the network, can network partitions cause different subsets of validators to have incompatible views of valid transactions, leading to consensus failures? (High)"
