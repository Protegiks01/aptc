  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Task cancellation] Is the async task started by run_service properly cancellable, or can orphaned tasks continue running after the faucet should be stopped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Panic propagation] If the faucet server panics inside the async task, is this properly caught and converted to an error, or can panics escape and crash unrelated services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Default value] The faucet_port default of 8081 (line 33) - can this conflict with common services, and is there documentation warning users about port conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetManager] [Debug trait] The Debug trait implementation (line 41) could expose sensitive configuration in logs - does it properly redact sensitive fields like private keys or API keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Imports] [Dependency chain] Do all imported crates (aptos_faucet_core, reqwest, etc.) have security audits, or can vulnerabilities in dependencies be exploited through this file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Documentation clarity] Do the doc comments properly warn that --do-not-delegate reduces security, or can users unknowingly weaken their faucet configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetArgs] [Hidden flag] The with_faucet flag is hidden (line 26) - can this create confusion in automated scripts that try to use it, leading to unexpected faucet behavior? (Low)"
