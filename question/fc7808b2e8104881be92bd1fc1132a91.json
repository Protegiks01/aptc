  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Struct: BasicNodeInfoCollector] [Immutable State] The collector stores immutable metrics created at initialization - if node version or git hash should be dynamic (e.g., hot-reload scenarios), does this design prevent runtime updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Struct: BasicNodeInfoCollector] [Missing Clone/Copy] The struct doesn't implement Clone - could this cause issues if the collector needs to be duplicated for different metric registries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Struct: BasicNodeInfoCollector] [No Drop Implementation] There's no explicit Drop implementation to clean up ConstMetric resources - could this cause resource leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Constants: Label Names] [Naming Collision] Do the label constants (RELEASE_GIT_HASH_LABEL, RELEASE_VERSION_LABEL, NODE_HOSTNAME_LABEL) conflict with other metrics in the 'node' namespace, potentially causing metric name collisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Constants: Label Names] [Reserved Keywords] Do any label names (GIT_HASH_LABEL='git_hash', VERSION_LABEL='version', HOSTNAME_LABEL='name') match Prometheus reserved keywords or conventions that could cause parsing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Git Hash Exposure] Does exposing full git commit hashes in metrics allow attackers to correlate node versions with specific code changes, enabling targeted exploitation of known vulnerabilities in specific commits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Hostname Privacy] Does exposing real hostnames in metrics violate privacy expectations or enable network topology mapping for attackers planning targeted attacks on specific validator infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Version Fingerprinting] Does exposing exact package versions allow attackers to fingerprint node software stacks and identify outdated nodes vulnerable to known CVEs for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Supply Chain Attack] If the fallback_build_info uses aptos_build_info::get_git_hash() which reads GIT_SHA environment variable, can compromised CI/CD pipelines inject malicious version strings that persist in production metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Reproducible Builds] Does the build info expose non-deterministic data (e.g., build timestamps, hostnames from build machines) that breaks reproducible build verification and enables binary tampering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Partial Initialization] If any unwrap() fails during new(), the function panics without cleanup - could this leave the metrics system in an inconsistent state causing other collectors to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Cascading Failures] If ConstMetric::new_gauge() fails for one metric but succeeds for others, does the all-or-nothing unwrap() approach prevent partial metric collection where some node info is better than none? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Import: NAMESPACE] [Namespace Isolation] The NAMESPACE constant is imported from collectors::common - if this namespace ('node') is shared across multiple collectors, could metric name conflicts between collectors cause overwriting or data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [String Cloning] Multiple .cloned() calls on Option<String> values - could excessive cloning of large strings cause memory bloat if build info contains unexpectedly large values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [BTreeMap Ownership] The maybe_build_info parameter is &BTreeMap but values are cloned - does this prevent zero-copy optimization and cause unnecessary allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: desc()] [Descriptor Lifetime] The desc() method returns Vec<&Desc> with borrowed references - if ConstMetric internal state is mutated, could these references become invalid causing use-after-free? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: collect()] [MetricFamily Protocol] Does the collect() method properly follow Prometheus MetricFamily protocol requirements (e.g., metric type consistency, label ordering) to prevent scrape failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Thread Safety] If new() is called concurrently from multiple threads with different build_info parameters, could race conditions in aptos_build_info module cause inconsistent metric initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Global State] Does aptos_build_info::get_git_hash() access global state or environment variables that could be mutated during new() execution, causing TOCTOU issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Overall Design] [Monitoring Blindness] If metrics collection fails due to any of the unwrap() panics, does the validator lose ALL metrics visibility (not just node info), creating operational blindness during critical incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Overall Design] [Version Mismatch Detection] Do monitoring systems rely on these metrics to detect version mismatches across validator sets - if metrics are spoofed or incorrect, could this allow Byzantine validators running modified code to go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Overall Design] [Emergency Response] During security incidents requiring rapid version identification, if these metrics show 'unknown' due to build issues, could operators be unable to quickly identify vulnerable nodes needing patching?
