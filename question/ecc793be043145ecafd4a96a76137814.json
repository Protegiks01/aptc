  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Gas Metering] [Metadata Manipulation] StateValueMetadata contains deposit fields - can decode_value() be exploited to modify these during reads, bypassing storage deposit requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Gas Metering] [Compression Attacks] If BCS encoding applies compression, can attackers craft StateValues that decompress to much larger sizes, causing denial-of-service through excessive storage gas charges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Gas Metering] [Key Size Gas] Are gas charges applied to encoded key size as well as value size, or can attackers use extremely long StateKeys to bypass storage gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Merkle Tree] [Hash Input Consistency] Are StateValues hashed before or after encode_value(), and can inconsistencies cause the same logical state to produce different Merkle tree hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Merkle Tree] [Leaf Node Construction] Does the Jellyfish Merkle Tree use encoded StateKeys as leaf node keys, and if so, can encode_key() inconsistencies break tree structure and prevent state proof verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Merkle Tree] [Tombstone Representation] When StateValue is None (tombstone), how is this represented in the Merkle tree, and can ambiguity between null values and deleted values corrupt the tree? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/state_value/mod.rs] [Merkle Tree] [Version Snapshot] Does the Merkle tree store one tree per version, and if so, can version bit-flipping cause snapshot reads to query wrong tree versions? (High)"
