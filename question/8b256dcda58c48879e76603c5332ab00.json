  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Hash collision] Can Block.id() hash collisions on line 133 cause different blocks to overwrite each other in storage, leading to consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [QC validation] Does line 136 validate that qc.certified_block() returns a valid HashValue, or can malformed QCs with invalid block IDs be stored? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_data()] [Consensus invariants] Does get_data() verify critical consensus invariants (e.g., all QCs reference existing blocks), or can inconsistent data be returned? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Unbounded growth] Is there a maximum limit on the number of blocks/QCs that can be stored, or can attackers cause unbounded database growth leading to disk exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_vote()] [Vote size limit] Is the size of the vote Vec<u8> validated, or can excessively large votes cause storage or memory issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_all()] [Pagination missing] Does get_all() support pagination to handle large result sets, or can retrieving millions of entries cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Deprecated CF cleanup] Is the deprecated 'ordered_anchor_id' column family on line 61 properly migrated or cleaned up, or can stale data cause compatibility issues? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Schema version] Does ConsensusDB track schema versions to handle database format changes during upgrades, or can version mismatches cause corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_vote() + get_last_vote()] [Vote persistence integrity] Can a validator save a vote, crash, restart, and have get_last_vote() return a different/missing vote due to improper fsync, breaking safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate() + get_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate()] [TC persistence] Can timeout certificate persistence fail silently, causing validators to lose TC data and make incorrect timeout decisions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates() + get_data()] [Recovery consistency] After a crash during save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates(), does get_data() return consistent state or can it return partially saved data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Single block with no QC] Can save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates() be called with blocks but empty qc_data, and if so, is this state properly handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [QCs without blocks] Can save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates() be called with QCs but empty block_data, creating orphaned QCs in the database? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_all()] [Slow iteration] Can get_all() on line 203-205 cause consensus delays if the database contains millions of entries, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Large batch DoS] Can extremely large block_data/qc_data vectors cause excessive memory allocation or slow batch operations, degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: commit()] [Fsync behavior] Does write_schemas_relaxed() on line 158 call fsync to ensure data is persisted to disk, or can validator crashes cause vote/block loss that breaks safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Database locking] Does new() properly lock the database directory to prevent multiple validator processes from opening the same ConsensusDB simultaneously and corrupting it? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_data()] [Stale read] Can get_data() return stale consensus data if called immediately after save operations due to caching, causing validators to make decisions on outdated state? (High)"
