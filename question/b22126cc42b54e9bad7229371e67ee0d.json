  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Type Safety] [Pattern match completeness] If new Payload enum variants are added to the codebase, will the pattern match at line 93 cause compilation errors or allow unexpected payload types through? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone performance] The .clone() at line 94 creates a deep copy of potentially large transaction vectors - can this cause memory spikes during high transaction volumes leading to OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Async Safety] [Send/Sync bounds] Does the TPayloadManager trait properly enforce Send + Sync bounds for DirectMempoolPayloadManager to prevent thread safety issues in concurrent consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Lifetime Safety] [Borrowed data] Does passing block references throughout these functions create lifetime issues where blocks could be dropped while transactions are still being processed? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Consensus Attack] [Transaction censorship] Can Byzantine validators use check_denied_inline_transactions() to selectively censor transactions from specific senders while appearing to follow protocol rules? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Consensus Attack] [Block withholding] Can malicious validators propose blocks with DirectMempool payloads they know will fail validation on other nodes, causing voting failures and consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Consensus Attack] [Payload replacement] After check_denied_inline_transactions() validation passes, can transactions be replaced before execution, bypassing filter checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Consensus Attack] [Equivocation] Can a validator propose different DirectMempool payloads to different peers in the same round, causing state divergence and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_manager/direct_mempool_payload_manager.rs] [Consensus Attack] [Timing manipulation] Can validators manipulate block timestamps to cause time-based transaction filters to evaluate differently across the network, breaking consensus? (High)"
