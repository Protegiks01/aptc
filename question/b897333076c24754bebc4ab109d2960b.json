  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol negotiation] Is there proper protocol negotiation to ensure sender and receiver agree on the protocol, or can protocol mismatches cause deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Error handling] Does to_bytes_by_protocol() handle serialization errors gracefully, or can serialization failures for one peer affect message delivery to other peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [Network ID hardcoding] Does get_peer_network_id_for_peer() hardcode NetworkId::Validator, preventing proper isolation between different network types and potentially enabling cross-network attacks? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: RPC] [Protocol priority] Can an attacker exploit the priority ordering in RPC protocols to force downgrade to less secure protocols (ConsensusRpcJson instead of ConsensusRpcCompressed)? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: DIRECT_SEND] [Message ordering] Do different DIRECT_SEND protocols guarantee the same message ordering, or can protocol differences cause consensus inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Constant: DIRECT_SEND] [Compression bypass] Can an attacker exploit differences between compressed and uncompressed protocols to send messages that decompress to malicious payloads? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Serialization] [Size limits] Are there maximum size limits enforced on serialized ConsensusMsg variants, or can unbounded messages cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
