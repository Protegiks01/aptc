  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [ABI Integrity] Does the function validate that deserialized ABIs are well-formed with valid module names, function names, and type signatures, or can malformed ABIs cause crashes in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Module Name Validation] Can ABIs with empty or null module names pass through the read process and cause panics when module_name().to_string() is called during sorting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Function Name Validation] Can ABIs with excessively long function names (e.g., 1MB strings) cause memory exhaustion or performance issues during sorting and processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Duplicate Detection] If duplicate ABIs are present (same module+function), does the sort preserve both or eliminate duplicates, and can this be exploited to inject malicious duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Windows Path Handling] Does the path handling work correctly on Windows with backslashes and drive letters, or can platform differences cause validators on different OSes to discover different ABIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Permissions Check] Does the function check file permissions before attempting to read, or can attempting to read protected files cause errors that disrupt SDK generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Filesystem Type] Can different filesystem types (ext4, NTFS, NFS) cause different file ordering or behavior, leading to non-deterministic ABI ordering across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [ABI Tampering] Does the function verify cryptographic signatures or checksums on .abi files, or can attackers replace legitimate ABIs with malicious ones to generate compromised SDK code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Content Authenticity] Is there any mechanism to verify that ABIs come from trusted sources, or can any .abi file in the directory be processed, allowing supply chain attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Empty Directory] Does the function handle empty directories correctly, returning an empty Vec, or can this cause unexpected behavior in downstream code expecting at least one ABI? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Empty ABI File] If an .abi file is empty (0 bytes), does bcs::from_bytes() handle this gracefully or panic/error, and is the error properly propagated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Zero-Length Vector] If the function returns an empty Vec<EntryABI>, do callers handle this correctly, or can empty results cause panics in downstream code expecting non-empty ABI lists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Single ABI] Does the sorting logic work correctly when only a single ABI is present, or can single-element vectors trigger edge cases in the comparison logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [API Misuse] Can callers pass overlapping directory paths in dir_paths that cause the same .abi files to be loaded multiple times, creating duplicate ABIs and incorrect SDK code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Absolute vs Relative Paths] Does the function handle both absolute and relative paths correctly, or can mixing them cause path resolution issues and missing ABIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Null Path] Can AsRef<Path> trait allow null or invalid path objects to be passed, causing panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_abi_paths()] [Algorithmic Complexity] Does the recursive directory traversal have O(n) complexity where n is total files, or can pathological directory structures cause O(n²) or worse performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [Sorting Complexity] Is the sort guaranteed to be O(n log n), or can adversarial ABI orderings trigger worst-case O(n²) sorting behavior causing validator slowdowns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: read_abis()] [I/O Blocking] Can slow filesystem operations (e.g., network-mounted directories) cause read_abis() to block indefinitely, hanging validator SDK generation? (Medium)",
