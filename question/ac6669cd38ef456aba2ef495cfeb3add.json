  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Async Reconfiguration] If the RECONFIGURE_WITH_DKG feature is enabled, does the code properly handle the asynchronous nature of reconfiguration, or can OIDC provider changes be visible before the DKG completes, creating a window where authentication uses partially-updated provider data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Reconfiguration Ordering] Can an attacker craft operations that exploit the sequential execution order in the for loop at line 39, making early operations modify state in ways that cause later operations or the reconfigure() call to fail or produce unintended results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK Removal] In the Remove operation with keep_observed_jwks=false, can an attacker exploit the two-step removal process (remove provider at line 69, then remove observed JWKs at line 74) to create a state where the provider is removed but JWKs remain if the proposal execution is interrupted between these calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK Consistency] Can an attacker remove an OIDC provider with keep_observed_jwks=false while validators are still observing JWKs from that provider, causing authentication failures for users with valid tokens from that provider until the next JWK consensus update? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK State Mismatch] Can the Upsert operation at lines 52-60 update the SupportedOIDCProviders list without waiting for validators to fetch JWKs from the new config_url, creating a period where the provider is listed as supported but has no observed JWKs, breaking authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK Removal Logic] Does the keep_observed_jwks boolean flag at line 71 properly control the conditional execution of remove_issuer_from_observed_jwks, or can compiler optimizations or Move VM bugs cause the JWKs to be removed regardless of the flag value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK Update Race] Can rapid Upsert operations on the same issuer with different config_urls cause the on-chain state to diverge from validator-observed JWKs if validators are fetching from the old URL while a new config_url is already registered? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [JWK Orphaning] If a Remove operation with keep_observed_jwks=true is followed by a second Remove on the same issuer with keep_observed_jwks=false, can this leave orphaned JWKs in ObservedJWKs that validators continue using for authentication despite the provider being removed from SupportedOIDCProviders? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [State Atomicity] If multiple operations modify the same issuer (e.g., Remove followed by Upsert), does the proposal execution guarantee atomicity, or can partial execution leave the issuer in an undefined state if gas runs out or an abort occurs mid-execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [State Transition] Can an attacker create a sequence of operations that exploits state transition logic in the jwks module, such as Upserting a provider, Removing it with keep_observed_jwks=true, then Upserting again with a malicious config_url that inherits the old observed JWKs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Config Buffer] Since upsert_oidc_provider_for_next_epoch uses config_buffer to stage changes, can an attacker exploit the time window between proposal execution and the next epoch to submit additional proposals that overwrite the buffered changes, causing governance votes to not take effect as intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [Epoch Boundary] Can proposals execute at the exact moment of an epoch transition, causing OIDC provider changes to apply immediately without being buffered for the next epoch, breaking the for_next_epoch semantics and creating authentication inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Operation Idempotence] Are Upsert and Remove operations idempotent when executed multiple times in the same proposal or across multiple proposals, or can repeated operations cause unintended side effects like duplicate entries or corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Authentication Bypass] Can an attacker upsert a malicious OIDC provider with an issuer string that collides with a legitimate provider (e.g., using homograph characters like 'gооgle.com' with Cyrillic 'o'), allowing them to issue tokens that authenticate as the legitimate provider? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Configuration Poisoning] Can an attacker upsert a legitimate issuer (e.g., 'https://accounts.google.com') with a malicious config_url pointing to an attacker-controlled server that serves fake JWKs, allowing them to forge authentication tokens for any user? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Provider Hijacking] Can an attacker remove a legitimate OIDC provider with keep_observed_jwks=false and immediately re-register it with a malicious config_url, exploiting the time window to inject malicious JWKs before validators fetch the new configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [Case Sensitivity] Does the issuer matching in the jwks module respect case sensitivity (HTTP specifications require case-insensitive domain comparison), or can an attacker register 'HTTPS://ACCOUNTS.GOOGLE.COM' as a distinct provider to bypass existing provider checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [URL Normalization] Can an attacker exploit URL encoding, trailing slashes, or port specifications (e.g., 'https://accounts.google.com/', 'https://accounts.google.com:443') to register multiple distinct providers that validators treat as the same issuer, causing authentication confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [DoS via Gas Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit a proposal with thousands of Upsert operations, each adding a new OIDC provider, causing the proposal execution to consume excessive gas that either fails the proposal or makes future governance operations prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [DoS via Provider Removal] Can an attacker submit proposals to repeatedly remove and re-add critical OIDC providers (like Google, Facebook), causing intermittent authentication failures for users and disrupting the keyless account service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [DoS via Invalid URLs] Can an attacker upsert OIDC providers with config_urls that point to non-existent, slow, or malicious servers, causing validators to waste resources attempting to fetch JWKs and degrading JWK consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal()] [DoS via Reconfigure Spam] Can an attacker submit multiple governance proposals that only call reconfigure() without making meaningful OIDC changes, causing unnecessary epoch transitions that degrade network performance and increase validator overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function: write_op()] [DoS via Provider Flooding] Can an attacker upsert hundreds of unique but unused OIDC providers, bloating the SupportedOIDCProviders list and causing validators to waste bandwidth fetching JWKs from providers that no users actually use? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Enum: OidcProviderOp] [Deserialization] Can an attacker exploit the Deserialize trait to provide malformed OidcProviderOp variants that pass Rust deserialization but produce invalid Move code when processed by write_op(), causing proposal generation failures or corrupted scripts?
