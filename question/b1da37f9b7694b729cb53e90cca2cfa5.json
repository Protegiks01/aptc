(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Generated Code] [Untrusted deserialization] The PREBUILT_BUNDLE_BYTES is included at compile time but comes from prebuilt.mpb file - if this file is modified after compilation but before deployment, can malicious data be deserialized?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/prebuild_packages.rs] [Generated Code] [Version mismatch] If the PrebuiltPackagesBundle struct definition changes between when prebuilt.mpb was created and when the generated code deserializes it, can version mismatch cause deserialization errors or undefined behavior?
