  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Faucet Drain] If an attacker discovers the magic header value, can they submit unlimited requests to drain the entire faucet balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Rate Limiting] Does the magic header checker integrate with rate limiting mechanisms, or can attackers with the correct header bypass all rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Amount Limits] Does the checker have any control over fund amounts, or can attackers request maximum amounts as long as they have the correct header? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Test Coverage] Are there comprehensive tests covering edge cases like empty strings, Unicode, very long values, concurrent access, and timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Fuzz Testing] Has the checker been fuzz-tested with random/malformed header values to discover crashes, panics, or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Config Migration] If the config format changes in the future, could old configs be misinterpreted in ways that weaken security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Version Skew] Can version mismatches between config files and code create vulnerabilities where headers are not properly validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Proxy Interference] Can reverse proxies, load balancers, or CDNs modify, strip, or duplicate the magic header in ways that bypass or break validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [TLS Termination] If TLS is terminated at a proxy, can the magic header be intercepted, logged, or leaked during transit? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Regex DoS] If the header key or value matching uses regular expressions internally, can attackers craft inputs that cause catastrophic backtracking and CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Locale Issues] Can locale-specific string comparison rules (collation) create inconsistencies between config parsing and runtime validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [GraphQL/Alternative Protocols] If the faucet supports GraphQL or other protocols in addition to REST, does the magic header check apply consistently across all protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderChecker] [Struct Size] Is the MagicHeaderChecker struct small enough to be efficiently cloned/moved, or can large sizes cause performance issues with many concurrent requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Early Return] Can the early return patterns at lines 36-40 and 43-49 be exploited to bypass subsequent security checks in the validation chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: cost()] [Cost Calculation] Is the cost value of 2 used consistently across all checker ordering decisions, or can it be overridden in ways that affect security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Overall] [Documentation] Is the security model and threat model for the magic header checker properly documented, including what attacks it does and doesn't protect against? (Low)"
