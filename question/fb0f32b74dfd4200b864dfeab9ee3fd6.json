  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Invariant violation] After serialization and deserialization round-trip, is it guaranteed that the package name still satisfies validation rules, or could serde transformations corrupt the internal string?
