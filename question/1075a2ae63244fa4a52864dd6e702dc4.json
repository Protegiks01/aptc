  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker bypass authentication by sending requests when authentication_configs is empty, allowing unauthorized access to critical consensus DB dumps, mempool state, and heap profiling endpoints without any credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Hash collision attack] Does the PasscodeSha256 authentication use a timing-safe comparison, or can an attacker exploit timing side channels to gradually discover the correct passcode hash and gain unauthorized admin access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Authentication logic flaw] Can an attacker exploit the authentication loop that iterates through multiple authentication_configs to cause authentication to succeed even with an invalid passcode if any config passes, potentially due to incorrect boolean logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Plaintext passcode exposure] Is the passcode sent in clear text via URL query parameters, allowing network eavesdroppers or server logs to capture admin credentials and gain unauthorized persistent access to all admin endpoints?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Replay attack] Does the authentication mechanism use any nonce or timestamp validation, or can an attacker capture a valid authenticated request and replay it indefinitely to maintain unauthorized admin access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::new()] [Default insecure configuration] Is the admin service enabled by default with weak or no authentication in production deployments, exposing critical consensus and mempool data to unauthorized access on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [URL parsing vulnerability] Can an attacker craft malicious URL query parameters with special characters or encoding that bypass authentication checks but still get processed by downstream handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Authentication state confusion] If multiple authentication methods are configured, can an attacker exploit race conditions or state confusion to authenticate with one method but execute privileged operations requiring a different authentication level? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests() - /debug/consensus/consensusdb] [Information disclosure] Does dumping the entire consensus database reveal private validator voting history, safety rule state, or cryptographic material that could be used to predict future consensus behavior or identify Byzantine validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests() - /debug/consensus/block] [Consensus manipulation] Can an attacker request specific block IDs via the block_id parameter to probe for blocks that were proposed but not committed, revealing information about failed consensus rounds that could be exploited to attack liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::consensus::dump_consensus_db()] [Private key exposure] Does the consensus DB dump include any cryptographic keys, BLS signature shares, or VRF proofs that could compromise validator security or enable signature forgery attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests() - /debug/consensus/quorumstoredb] [Batch poisoning] Can an attacker request specific quorum store batches by digest to identify transaction batches before they're committed, enabling front-running or MEV attacks on high-value transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::consensus::dump_blocks_bcs()] [BCS deserialization attack] Does the BCS serialization of blocks include any unvalidated or maliciously crafted data that could cause crashes or memory corruption when deserialized by auditing tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::consensus::extract_txns_from_block()] [Transaction disclosure] Can dumping blocks with the bcs=true parameter expose pending transactions that reveal user account balances, transfer amounts, or smart contract state before they're publicly committed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests() - /debug/consensus/consensusdb] [Epoch transition secrets] Does the consensus DB dump reveal epoch transition logic, validator set changes, or reconfiguration events that could be exploited to attack the network during epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::consensus::dump_quorum_store_db()] [Digest enumeration] Can an attacker enumerate all batch digests by repeatedly calling the endpoint without specifying a digest parameter, building a complete map of all pending quorum store batches for MEV exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::Context] [Race condition on database access] Are the RwLock-protected database references (aptos_db, consensus_db, quorum_store_db) properly synchronized, or can concurrent admin requests cause race conditions that corrupt consensus state or cause inconsistent reads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::Context::set_consensus_dbs()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Can an attacker exploit a time-of-check-time-of-use race between checking if consensus_db is Some() and actually using it, causing null pointer dereferences or using stale database handles? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::serve_requests()] [Concurrent DB dump attacks] Can multiple simultaneous requests to dump the consensus DB cause resource exhaustion, deadlocks, or inconsistent snapshots where blocks reference non-existent parent blocks? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/lib.rs] [Module: server::consensus::dump_blocks()] [Stale batch access] When dumping blocks with quorum store batches, can a race condition cause the function to reference batches that were pruned between get_all_batches() and extract_txns_from_block(), causing panics or incorrect data?
