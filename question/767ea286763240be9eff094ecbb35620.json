(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] Does the tokio::main runtime properly handle panics that occur in args.parse() or args.run(), or can a panic bypass error handling and leave the service in an inconsistent state without proper cleanup? (Medium)",
