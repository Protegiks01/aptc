  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: reduce_coin_apt_supply()] [Supply aggregator manipulation] Can the aggregator_v1_delta_set be manipulated by concurrent transactions to cause incorrect supply tracking, where the sum of individual balance changes doesn't match the total supply delta? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: reduce_coin_apt_supply()] [Delta history fabrication] The DeltaHistory is manually constructed with specific max/min values. Can these values be manipulated to bypass aggregator bounds checking, allowing supply to exceed max_value or go below 0? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: reduce_coin_apt_supply()] [Missing coin info validation] The function immediately returns Err(()) if CoinInfoResource doesn't exist. In a parallel execution environment, can this cause supply reduction to fail for some transactions but not others, leading to inconsistent gas deduction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_apt()] [Migration state desynchronization] The function branches based on fa_migration_complete. Can transactions executing in parallel with different cached migration states cause some withdrawals to use FA logic and others Coin logic, leading to lost funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Balance underflow] The check 'fa_store.balance >= transfer_amount + gas' prevents underflow, but what happens in parallel execution if multiple transactions pass this check before any updates are committed? Can this lead to double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Integer overflow in addition] When calculating 'transfer_amount + gas', can integer overflow occur if both values are near u64::MAX, causing the underflow check to pass incorrectly and allowing over-withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Missing store validation] If FungibleStoreResource doesn't exist, the function returns Err(()). Can an attacker exploit this by ensuring their FA store is never created, making their account unable to pay gas and blocking transaction execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Event generation bypass] The WithdrawFAEvent is only generated when transfer_amount > 0. Can transactions with zero transfer but positive gas fees bypass event emission, breaking event-based accounting systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Resource group size inconsistency] When calling create_single_resource_in_group_modification, can the returned group size be inconsistent with the actual serialized size, causing resource group corruption or merkle tree inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_coin_apt_from_signer()] [Fallback logic vulnerability] When CoinStoreResource doesn't exist, the function falls back to withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer. Can this fallback be exploited to withdraw from FA stores that shouldn't be accessible, or to bypass balance checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_coin_apt_from_signer()] [Coin arithmetic overflow] The operation 'sender_coin_store.coin() - transfer_amount - gas' uses unchecked subtraction. Can this underflow if the coin amount is less than the sum, even though it should have been caught earlier? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_coin_apt_from_signer()] [Event handle corruption] Events are created by mutating sender_coin_store.withdraw_events_mut(). Can concurrent mutations to event handles cause event duplication or loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_coin_apt_from_signer()] [Gas event omission] The comment states 'coin doesn't emit WithdrawEvent for gas.' Can this inconsistency between gas handling and transfer handling be exploited to hide transactions from event-based monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_apt()] [Return value confusion] The function returns bool indicating whether store existed. Can callers misinterpret this value, leading to incorrect account creation logic or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Balance overflow] When incrementing 'fa_store.balance += transfer_amount', is there overflow protection? Can an attacker deposit amounts that cause balance to wrap around to small values, stealing funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Resource group creation race] When creating a new FA store with ObjectCore and FungibleStore resources, can concurrent transactions create conflicting resource groups at the same address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Object core fabrication] The function creates a new ObjectCore with DbAccessUtil::new_object_core(). Can incorrect owner or guid values in the ObjectCore be exploited to claim ownership of deposits or bypass access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Frozen store bypass] FungibleStoreResource has a frozen field initialized to false. Can deposits to frozen stores be exploited to unfreeze accounts that should remain frozen? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Resource group size calculation] When calculating group size for new resource groups, can the size calculation in create_resource_in_group_creation overflow or be manipulated to cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_coin_apt()] [Event generation attack] When creating a new CoinStore, a CoinRegister event is emitted with account: AccountAddress::ONE. Why is this hardcoded to ONE instead of the actual recipient? Can this be exploited to confuse event indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_coin_apt()] [Balance overflow] The operation 'recipient_coin_store.coin() + transfer_amount' uses unchecked addition. Can this overflow when depositing large amounts, causing balance to wrap to small values and enabling fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_coin_apt()] [Event handle initialization] For new CoinStores, are deposit/withdraw event handles properly initialized with unique GUIDs? Can handle collisions cause events to be attributed to wrong accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: deposit_coin_apt()] [Metadata consistency] The function uses different WriteOps for existing vs new stores (modification vs creation). Can this inconsistency cause state root mismatches across validators if they disagree on whether a store existed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: create_single_resource_in_group_modification()] [Metadata retrieval failure] The function unwraps metadata retrieval. Can missing metadata cause panics in production, halting transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: create_single_resource_in_group_modification()] [Resource group size mismatch] The function uses view.resource_group_size() for both previous and current size in GroupWrite. Can this cause incorrect size tracking if the resource size actually changed? (High)"
