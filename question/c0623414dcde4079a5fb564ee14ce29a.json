  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Memory Leak] Does the benchmark measure memory leaks during repeated signature operations, or could production validators suffer memory exhaustion after processing millions of transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Stack Overflow] With 1000 sample iterations, could deep recursion in libsecp256k1 internal functions cause stack overflow in production validators with limited stack space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Buffer Overflow] Does parse_slice() perform bounds checking on the 32-byte input, or could an attacker supply oversized buffers in production to cause buffer overflows in native code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Use-After-Free] Could the move closure capture references to secret_key or pub_key that are freed before benchmark iterations complete, causing undefined behavior in production code patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Double-Free] If libsecp256k1 internal structures are freed prematurely during error handling, could production code suffer from double-free vulnerabilities during invalid signature processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Non-Deterministic Results] If libsecp256k1::recover() has any non-deterministic behavior across platforms, could validators produce different results for the same signature, causing consensus failures and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Platform Differences] Does the benchmark test secp256k1 operations across different CPU architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V), or could floating-point or endianness differences cause consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Compiler Optimizations] Could different Rust compiler versions or optimization levels produce different signature recovery results, causing validators to disagree on transaction validity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [Rounding Errors] Does libsecp256k1 use integer-only arithmetic to ensure deterministic results, or could floating-point rounding errors in curve operations cause non-deterministic signature recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/secp256k1.rs] [Function: ecdsa_recover()] [SIMD Instructions] If libsecp256k1 uses SIMD optimizations that behave differently across CPUs, could this cause validators to recover different public keys from identical signatures? (High)"
