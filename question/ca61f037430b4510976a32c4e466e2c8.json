  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Deadlock potential] For V1, if wait_for_dependency() is called with circular dependencies (txn A waits for B, B waits for A), can this cause permanent deadlock and block execution halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [Dependency confusion] Can dep_txn_idx be manipulated to reference a transaction that doesn't exist or is out of block bounds, causing wait_for_dependency() to hang indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [DependencyResult manipulation] Can the DependencyResult returned be forged or manipulated to indicate false dependency resolution, allowing transactions to execute with stale dependencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Can dependency status change between wait_for_dependency() check and actual transaction execution, causing read/write conflicts and incorrect parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Function: wait_for_dependency()] [V2 trait violation] The comment says 'SchedulerV2 does not use TWaitForDependency trait' - can calling code incorrectly use this trait on V2 triggering unreachable!() and crashing validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Cross-function race] Can concurrent calls to halt(), interrupt_requested(), and wait_for_dependency() create race conditions where transactions observe inconsistent halt states causing non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Cross-function] If add_to_post_commit() races with abort_pre_final_reexecution() for the same transaction, can this cause a transaction to be simultaneously committed and aborted, corrupting the final state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Cross-function] Can record_validation_requirements() be called after prepare_for_block_epilogue() has started, causing module validation to interfere with block finalization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Cross-function] If wake_dependencies_and_decrease_validation_idx() is called concurrently with add_to_post_commit() for dependent transactions, can this cause commit ordering violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [TxnIndex validation] None of the functions validate that txn_idx is within the current block bounds - can passing txn_idx >= block_size cause out-of-bounds access in the underlying schedulers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [TxnIndex] Can txn_idx be set to usize::MAX causing integer overflow when the index is incremented or used in arithmetic operations in underlying scheduler code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [TxnIndex ordering] Can transactions with manipulated txn_idx values execute out of sequential order, violating nonce-based replay protection and allowing transaction replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [TxnIndex] If the same txn_idx is passed to multiple functions (e.g., both abort and commit), can this create state machine violations where a transaction is in multiple states simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Incarnation overflow] Can incarnation numbers overflow during repeated re-execution cycles, wrapping to 0 and causing incarnation collisions with initial execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Incarnation] Does interrupt_requested() properly validate incarnation numbers, or can a stale incarnation number cause it to miss abort signals for current incarnations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Incarnation] Can the incarnation returned by prepare_for_block_epilogue() be manipulated to reference a prior execution attempt with different state, causing inconsistent epilogue execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Version confusion] Can a malicious actor force the block executor to switch between V1 and V2 schedulers mid-execution, causing state inconsistencies between the different scheduler implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Version confusion] Do all methods consistently check scheduler version before operations, or can some methods incorrectly assume V1 behavior when V2 is active (or vice versa)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Version confusion] If V1 and V2 schedulers are used on different validators for the same block, will they produce identical state roots despite implementation differences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Worker ID] Can a malicious worker provide a worker_id belonging to another worker thread, causing cross-worker state corruption or work stealing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Worker ID] Is worker_id validated against the total worker count, or can worker_id >= num_workers cause array out-of-bounds access in SchedulerV2 internal data structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Worker ID] Can worker_id be set to a special value (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF) that has special meaning in SchedulerV2, causing unexpected behavior or privilege escalation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [AtomicBool] The comment says the AtomicBool is 'never read' - if it's actually read elsewhere, can this cause race conditions due to the weak Ordering::Relaxed guarantee? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [AtomicBool] Can skip_module_reads_validation be exploited through cache coherency issues where different CPU cores observe different flag values, causing validation inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [AtomicBool] Is the AtomicBool properly initialized before first use, or can uninitialized memory cause undefined behavior in the flag? (Medium)"
