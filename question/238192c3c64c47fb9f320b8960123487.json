  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Clone panic] If Clone::clone() panics at line 148, is the interner left in a consistent state, or can this poison locks or corrupt internal state, requiring validator restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [OOM handling] If Vec::with_capacity fails to allocate memory at line 84, can the resulting panic be caught and handled gracefully, or does it crash the validator process unrecoverably? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Lock poisoning] If any operation panics while holding the write lock, does parking_lot's RwLock poison the lock, and can this cause all subsequent intern operations to fail, effectively disabling Move VM functionality? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Clear panic] Can any of the clear() operations on map, vec, buffer, or pool panic? If so, can partial clearing leave the interner in an unusable state that breaks subsequent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [ABA problem] Between releasing the read lock and acquiring the write lock, can the same value be interned, removed (via flush), and interned again with a different index, causing the second check to find the 'wrong' cached index? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: len()] [Snapshot inconsistency] If len() is called during concurrent intern operations, can it return a length that was never actually consistent with the true state, causing bounds checks to fail incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: lookup()] [Phantom read] Can lookup() return an index for a value that was just flushed by another thread, causing the caller to use an invalid index that crashes when dereferenced? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Empty-nonempty race] Can is_empty() return true while another thread is simultaneously interning a value, and if so, can this cause incorrect optimization decisions in calling code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Write lock starvation] Can continuous read operations prevent write operations from ever acquiring the lock, effectively preventing new values from being interned and blocking Move module loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [next_size overflow] Starting at 2048 and doubling each time, next_size reaches usize::MAX after about 50-60 doublings - can this overflow be triggered on long-running validators, and would the overflow cause memory corruption or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Index wraparound] If vec.len() - 1 is calculated when vec is empty (len=0), does this wrap around to usize::MAX, and could this be exploited to corrupt memory through out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Vec capacity overflow] Can Vec::push at line 159 panic if vec has somehow reached its maximum capacity, and would this panic leave map and vec inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Constant: INITIAL_SIZE] [Capacity calculation] When multiplying capacities, can intermediate calculations overflow, causing Vec::with_capacity to allocate less memory than expected and triggering unexpected reallocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: len()] [Length overflow] Can the vec length theoretically exceed usize::MAX on 32-bit systems, causing len() to return incorrect values and breaking index calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Raw pointer provenance] The cast from reference to raw pointer at line 92 may violate Rust's provenance rules - can optimizations based on provenance assumptions cause the returned reference to become invalid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Noalias violation] Does creating a 'static reference while the interner still owns the value violate LLVM's noalias assumptions, potentially causing miscompilation in optimized builds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Uninitialized memory] Can the buffer contain uninitialized memory that gets exposed through the 'static reference, especially if T doesn't implement Drop and contains padding bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Pointer aliasing] Multiple 'static references point to values in the same buffer - can this create aliasing issues that violate Rust's safety guarantees or cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Dangling pool references] When a buffer is moved to the pool, do all references into that buffer remain valid? Can Vec's move semantics or optimizations cause the referenced memory to be freed or relocated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: InternerPool] [BTreeMap key lifetime] The BTreeMap uses &'static T as keys - if these keys are created through unsafe transmutation, can this violate BTreeMap's internal invariants and cause lookup failures or corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Ord consistency] If T's Ord implementation is inconsistent (a < b and b < a both false, but a != b), can this corrupt the BTreeMap structure, causing subsequent lookups to return wrong indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: lookup()] [BTreeMap modification during iteration] If lookup() is called while another thread is modifying the BTreeMap, can this cause the BTreeMap to enter an inconsistent state or violate its invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Key comparison during insert] When inserting into BTreeMap at line 161, the key is compared with existing keys - can malicious Ord implementations during comparison cause side effects, panics, or deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: InternerPool] [BTreeMap memory overhead] BTreeMap has significant per-node memory overhead - can an attacker exploit this to amplify memory consumption by interning many unique values, each requiring a new tree node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: get()] [Index validation] The get() function uses vec.get() which returns Option, but is the None case properly handled by all callers? Can accessing a None unexpectedly cause panics in critical Move VM paths? (Medium)"
