(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Clone Security] Does the Clone trait implementation create insecure copies of sensitive cloudflare_auth_key credentials in memory, increasing attack surface for memory dumping attacks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Credential Rotation] Is there any mechanism to rotate the cloudflare_auth_key without service disruption, or does credential compromise require complete service restart exposing the system to downtime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Account Mismatch] Can mismatched cloudflare_account_id and cloudflare_account_hash values cause data integrity issues where assets are uploaded to one account but URLs reference another account's CDN? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Serialize Security] Does the Serialize trait allow sensitive cloudflare_auth_key to be serialized and transmitted over insecure channels or logged in audit trails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Default Variant Attack] Can a malicious cloudflare_default_variant value contain special characters or path traversal sequences that manipulate CDN URL construction to serve incorrect or malicious content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Memory Safety] Are String allocations for potentially large cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix values bounded, or can unbounded allocations lead to memory exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Regex Validation] Is the cloudflare_account_hash format validated against Cloudflare's expected hash format, or can arbitrary strings cause API authentication failures or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Unicode Handling] Are Unicode characters in cloudflare_default_variant properly handled, or can non-ASCII characters in variant names cause URL encoding issues leading to broken CDN image delivery? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [API Key Format] Is the cloudflare_auth_key validated against Cloudflare's API key format requirements, or can invalid formats cause authentication bypass attempts or unexpected API behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Whitespace Handling] Are leading/trailing whitespaces in cloudflare_auth_key trimmed during deserialization, or can whitespace-padded keys cause authentication failures masquerading as valid config? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Cross-Account Attack] If multiple instances use different AssetUploaderConfig, can race conditions in config loading cause one instance to use another's cloudflare_account_id, uploading assets to the wrong Cloudflare account? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Serde Deserialization] Can crafted YAML anchors and aliases in config files cause the same cloudflare_auth_key string to be referenced multiple times, creating unexpected memory aliasing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Protocol Downgrade] Is the cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix validated to use HTTPS, or can attackers inject HTTP URLs causing insecure NFT metadata delivery via unencrypted channels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Subdomain Takeover] If cloudflare_image_delivery_prefix uses a custom domain, is there protection against subdomain takeover attacks where expired DNS records allow attackers to serve malicious NFT metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Config Injection] Can environment variable substitution or config template injection attacks insert malicious values into cloudflare_auth_key at runtime before deserialization occurs?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/asset_uploader/config.rs] [Struct: AssetUploaderConfig] [Zero-Copy Issues] Does the String type usage prevent zero-copy optimizations for large config values, causing excessive memory allocations that could be exploited for denial of service?
