[
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Shared Mempool Design] [Consensus manipulation] The documentation states that mempool shares transactions with other nodes and maintains a 'pseudo global ordering' - can a Byzantine validator exploit the transaction sharing protocol to manipulate the global ordering and cause transaction censorship or prioritization attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Transaction Broadcasting] [Network attack] The documentation mentions that validators only broadcast transactions with sequence numbers equal to or sequential to the current account sequence number - can an attacker submit transactions with manipulated sequence numbers to prevent legitimate transactions from being broadcast, effectively censoring specific accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Pull-based Consensus] [Liveness attack] The documentation states that Consensus pulls transactions from mempool rather than mempool pushing - can a malicious consensus implementation repeatedly pull the same transactions without committing them, causing mempool exhaustion and denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Transaction State Tracking] [State inconsistency] The documentation mentions that mempool doesn't track transactions sent to Consensus and relies on Consensus to send back uncommitted transactions - can this design lead to state inconsistencies where transactions are lost or duplicated across different consensus branches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: PriorityIndex Ordering] [MEV/Front-running] The documentation describes a PriorityIndex ordered by gas price - can wealthy attackers exploit this gas price ordering to consistently front-run legitimate transactions, causing economic harm and potentially manipulating DeFi protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: ParkingLotIndex] [Resource exhaustion] The documentation mentions a ParkingLotIndex for non-ready transactions - can an attacker flood the parking lot with future-sequence transactions to exhaust memory and prevent legitimate transactions from being stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Account Transaction Limits] [Sybil attack] The documentation states there's a limit on transactions per account - can an attacker create multiple accounts to bypass this per-account limit and still flood the mempool with spam transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: System TTL] [Liveness attack] The documentation mentions that system TTL is checked periodically in the background - can an attacker exploit timing windows between TTL checks to keep expired transactions in mempool longer than intended, causing resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Client Expiration] [Timing attack] The documentation states that client-specified expiration is only checked on Consensus commit requests - if Consensus stops making progress, can attackers keep expired transactions alive indefinitely, violating expiration guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Transaction Rebroadcast] The documentation states 'we don't rebroadcast transactions originated on a different peer' - can a malicious peer exploit this by claiming to originate transactions it didn't actually create, preventing proper propagation and causing network partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: Sequence Number Filtering] [Censorship] The documentation explains that only sequential transactions are broadcast (e.g., if current is 2, only 2,3,4 are broadcast, not 7,8) - can a validator selectively drop transaction 3 to prevent transactions 4+ from ever being broadcast, censoring an entire account's future transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Architecture: HashMap Storage] [Collision attack] The documentation describes mempool as 'HashMap<AccountAddress, AccountTransactions>' - are there hash collision vulnerabilities in the account address hashing that could allow attackers to trigger worst-case O(n) lookup performance and DoS the mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: MempoolClientRequest] [Injection attack] The exported MempoolClientRequest enum allows submitting transactions via SubmitTransaction - can malicious clients submit specially crafted SignedTransaction objects that bypass validation in downstream modules, potentially causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: MempoolClientRequest] [Information leak] The GetTransactionByHash operation exposes transaction data by hash - can this be exploited to probe the mempool for specific transactions, enabling privacy violations or MEV attacks by identifying pending high-value transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: MempoolClientRequest] [Resource enumeration] The GetAddressesFromParkingLot operation returns all addresses with parked transactions - can an attacker use this to enumerate active accounts and their transaction patterns, enabling targeted attacks or privacy violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: QuorumStoreRequest] [Batch manipulation] The GetBatchRequest allows specifying max_txns, max_bytes, and return_non_full parameters - can malicious consensus or quorum store components request batches with extreme parameters (e.g., max_bytes = 0 or max_txns = u64::MAX) to cause panics or resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: QuorumStoreRequest] [Exclusion bypass] The GetBatchRequest includes exclude_transactions parameter - can a malicious quorum store manipulate the exclusion list to force mempool to repeatedly return the same transactions, causing infinite loops or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: QuorumStoreRequest] [Rejection flood] The RejectNotification allows batch rejection of transactions - can a malicious quorum store repeatedly reject valid transactions to prevent them from being committed, effectively censoring specific accounts or transaction types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: QuorumStoreResponse] [Type confusion] The QuorumStoreResponse returns either GetBatchResponse or CommitResponse - are there type safety issues where a CommitResponse could be misinterpreted as a GetBatchResponse, leading to invalid transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: SubmissionStatus] [Status manipulation] The SubmissionStatus type is defined as (MempoolStatus, Option<DiscardedVMStatus>) - can the None case in DiscardedVMStatus be exploited to bypass proper error handling, allowing invalid transactions to remain in mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [API: MempoolSyncMsg] [Message injection] The exported MempoolSyncMsg is used for network synchronization - can a malicious peer inject crafted sync messages to manipulate mempool state, cause transaction reordering, or trigger resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Module: core_mempool] [Isolation violation] The core_mempool module is not re-exported publicly - can internal implementation details leak through the public API, allowing attackers to exploit undocumented behaviors or bypass intended security boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Module: shared_mempool] [Race condition] The shared_mempool module handles network communication - are there race conditions between local transaction submission and network-received transactions that could lead to inconsistent state or transaction loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Module: shared_mempool::network] [Network isolation] The network module is exported for mempool synchronization - does this expose low-level network primitives that could be abused to bypass rate limiting, flood the network, or perform amplification attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/lib.rs] [Module: counters] [Metrics manipulation] The public counters module tracks mempool metrics - can attackers manipulate these counters to hide malicious activity, trigger false alarms, or cause monitoring systems to make incorrect decisions? (Low)"
