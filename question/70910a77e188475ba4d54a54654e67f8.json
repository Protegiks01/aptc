  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Label Injection via Onchain Data] If peer_id or network_id are derived from onchain governance proposals, can malicious governance attacks inject crafted values that exploit metric systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Histogram Bucket Configuration] Are the histogram buckets for EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S properly configured to detect both micro-second level timing attacks and multi-second DoS scenarios without losing fidelity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Code Quality] [Error Handling] All three metric registrations use unwrap() which will panic on failure - should these use proper error handling to prevent validator crashes during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Code Quality] [Documentation Mismatch] The DISCOVERY_COUNTS metric description says 'Histogram of busy time' which is incorrect (it's a counter not histogram) - can this documentation error lead to incorrect usage and security monitoring gaps? (Low)"
