  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_multi_signatures()] [Empty Signature] At line 375-378, None signature returns EmptySignature error. But before that, check_voting_power at line 364 already validated quorum. Can an attacker pass voting power checks with an empty signature when using an all-zero BitVec? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_multi_signatures()] [Public Key Aggregation] At line 380-381, PublicKey::aggregate can fail with FailedToAggregatePubKey. Can an attacker include public keys that cause aggregation failure (e.g., point at infinity) to DoS signature verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_multi_signatures()] [Verification Failure] At line 383-385, signature verification failure returns InvalidMultiSignature. Does this error hide the specific validator whose signature failed, making Byzantine validator identification impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_multi_signatures()] [CryptoHash Determinism] The message uses CryptoHash trait at line 346. If CryptoHash implementation is non-deterministic across validators, can different validators compute different hashes for the same message, causing verification failures? (High)",

If the same author appears multiple times in BitVec (due to index collision), is their voting power counted multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_aggregate_signatures()] [Message Count Mismatch] At line 391, messages is a slice of references. If messages.len() != number of set bits in aggregated_signature BitVec, does verify_aggregate properly reject, or can message/signature mismatch cause verification bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_aggregate_signatures()] [Message Ordering] At line 414-416, verify_aggregate is called with messages and pub_keys. If message order doesn't match BitVec order, can incorrect message-to-pubkey pairing cause valid signatures to be rejected or invalid ones accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_aggregate_signatures()] [Duplicate Messages] If messages slice contains duplicate message references, can an attacker aggregate multiple signatures for the same message under different public keys to manipulate voting power calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_aggregate_signatures()] [Empty Messages] If messages slice is empty, does verify_aggregate accept any signature? Can this be exploited when combined with empty BitVec to bypass all verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: verify_aggregate_signatures()] [Quorum Check Order] At line 407, check_voting_power is called before signature verification at line 414.

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: check_num_of_voters()] [U16 Limitation] num_validators is u16 at line 422. If actual validator set exceeds 65535 validators, does truncation cause incorrect validation, allowing bits beyond the 16-bit limit to be accepted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: check_num_of_voters()] [BitVec Mutation] This function takes &BitVec immutably, but BitVec might have interior mutability.

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_verifier.rs] [Function: check_aggregated_voting_power()] [Exact Quorum] At line 474, the check is aggregated_voting_power < target.
