  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Consensus divergence] Can validators with different VMConfig instances produce different execution results for the same transaction, causing state root mismatches and network partition requiring hardfork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Consensus divergence] Does VMConfig implement Hash or is used in any hashing for config change detection, and can attackers manipulate the hash to hide config changes that would cause execution divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Consensus divergence] If validators reload VMConfig mid-epoch with different feature flags, can this cause deterministic execution to break, leading to validators producing different state roots for blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [State inconsistency] Can race conditions during VMConfig updates cause some transactions in a block to execute with old config while others use new config, creating non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Consensus divergence] The comment states 'Always add new fields to the end' and 'do not delete existing fields' - can violating these rules during upgrades cause config serialization mismatches between validators running different versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [Type safety violation] When paranoid_type_checks is set to false, can attackers craft malicious Move bytecode that exploits type confusion bugs to access memory incorrectly, potentially stealing funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [Type safety violation] Can disabling paranoid_type_checks allow stack imbalance attacks where operations push/pop incorrect numbers of values, leading to type confusion and potential fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [Consensus divergence] If some validators have paranoid_type_checks=true while others have false, and malicious bytecode triggers a type check failure only on paranoid validators, does this cause execution divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [Type safety violation] Does setting paranoid_type_checks=false disable visibility checks, allowing attackers to call private functions or access private fields to bypass access control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [DoS] Can toggling paranoid_type_checks cause dramatic performance differences, enabling attackers to submit transactions that run fast without checks but timeout with checks enabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: legacy_check_invariant_in_swap_loc] [Compatibility break] The comment says 'Always set to false, no longer used' - can attackers exploit older nodes that still respect this field to cause consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: legacy_check_invariant_in_swap_loc] [State inconsistency] Is this field properly ignored everywhere, or can setting it to true on some validators cause different swap_loc instruction behavior leading to execution divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: max_value_nest_depth] [DoS] Can attackers craft deeply nested struct values approaching the max_value_nest_depth limit to consume excessive memory and CPU, causing validator nodes to crash or slow down? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: max_value_nest_depth] [DoS] If max_value_nest_depth is set to None, can attackers create infinitely nested values that exhaust validator memory and cause node crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: max_value_nest_depth] [Consensus divergence] Can different validators have different max_value_nest_depth values causing some to accept transactions that others reject, leading to execution divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: max_value_nest_depth] [Integer overflow] Is the u64 depth value properly checked for overflow when incremented during nesting checks, or can crafted values cause unchecked overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: max_value_nest_depth] [Default value] The default uses DEFAULT_MAX_VM_VALUE_NESTED_DEPTH from move_vm_types - can this constant be manipulated or is it validated to be safe against resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_size] [DoS] Can attackers create type layouts approaching the 512 node limit to cause excessive memory allocation and CPU consumption during layout computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_size] [Consensus divergence] If layout_max_size differs between validators, can transactions with layouts between the two limits cause some validators to fail while others succeed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_size] [Resource exhaustion] Does layout_max_size=512 provide sufficient protection, or can attackers craft struct types with 512 deeply nested fields that exhaust memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_size] [Default value] The default is 512 - is this based on security analysis or arbitrary, and can lowering it break existing contracts causing fund lockup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_size] [Integer overflow] Is u64 layout_max_size properly validated to prevent wrapping to zero or extremely large values that bypass limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: layout_max_depth] [DoS] Can attackers create type layouts with 128-deep nesting causing stack overflow during recursive layout traversal? (High)",
