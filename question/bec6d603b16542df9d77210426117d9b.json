  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Concurrency: mutex poisoning] [Lock poisoning] If any function panics while holding a Mutex on ObserverBlockData, does this poison the mutex and prevent all future access to block data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Concurrency: lock ordering] [Deadlock] Can different execution paths acquire locks on ObserverBlockData and internal store structures in different orders, causing deadlock? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Memory: PipelinedBlock lifetime] [Memory leak] Are Arc<PipelinedBlock> references properly released when blocks are removed, or do circular references prevent cleanup? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Memory: BTreeMap growth] [Unbounded memory] Can BTreeMaps in stores grow without bounds during attack scenarios (e.g., flood of invalid blocks), causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Crypto: signature verification bypass] [Unverified payload acceptance] Can setting verified_payload_signatures=true in insert_block_payload bypass actual cryptographic verification, allowing invalid payloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Crypto: quorum cert validation] [QC verification bypass] Does get_parent_pipeline_futs validate that the quorum cert in block is properly signed before using it to determine parent? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Crypto: epoch state mismatch] [Wrong validator set] If verify_payload_signatures is called with epoch_state from wrong epoch, can payloads be verified against incorrect validator set? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Consensus: three-chain rule] [Commit rule violation] Does the code properly enforce Aptos' three-chain commit rule, or can blocks be committed prematurely breaking safety? (Critical)",
