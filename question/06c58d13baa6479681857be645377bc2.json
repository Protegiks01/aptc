  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_preferred_protocol_for_peer()] [Protocol downgrade attack] Can a malicious peer advertise support for only weak/deprecated protocols to force the NetworkClient to select a vulnerable protocol version, potentially enabling message tampering or bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_preferred_protocol_for_peer()] [Protocol confusion] If a peer advertises multiple conflicting protocol versions, can an attacker exploit the preference ordering to cause protocol mismatches between sender and receiver, leading to message corruption or consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_supported_protocols()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to get_supported_protocols() while peer metadata is being updated lead to inconsistent protocol sets being returned, causing messages to be sent with invalid protocol IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Missing peer validation] Does send_to_peer() validate that the peer is still connected before sending, or can stale peer entries cause messages to be sent to disconnected peers, potentially leaking sensitive consensus data? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Timeout bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the rpc_timeout parameter to set extremely long timeouts, causing resource exhaustion as pending RPC requests accumulate and block consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_rpc()] [Response substitution] If multiple concurrent RPCs are sent to the same peer, can response messages be mismatched or substituted due to lack of proper request-response correlation, enabling peer impersonation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Partial delivery] When send_to_peers() fails mid-way through the peer list, does it properly handle partial delivery scenarios where some peers receive the message but others don't, potentially causing consensus disagreement? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: group_peers_by_protocol()] [Protocol preference manipulation] Can an attacker register malicious peers with specific protocol support to manipulate the grouping logic, causing critical messages to be routed through compromised peers?

  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_sender_for_network_id()] [Network ID spoofing] If an attacker can construct PeerNetworkId with arbitrary network_id values, can they bypass network isolation and send messages across network boundaries (e.g., testnet to mainnet)? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_raw()] [Raw message injection] Does send_to_peer_raw() perform any validation on the raw bytes being sent, or can malicious applications inject arbitrary malformed messages that crash remote peers or trigger protocol violations? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol serialization bypass] Can an attacker exploit protocol-specific serialization differences in to_bytes_by_protocol() to send messages that deserialize differently on different peers, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: disconnect_from_peer()] [Disconnect race condition] If disconnect_from_peer() is called while messages are being sent to that peer, can this create race conditions where messages are sent to partially disconnected peers, causing network layer inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Stale peer list] Can get_available_peers() return peers that have just disconnected but haven't been removed from metadata yet, causing applications to send critical consensus messages to unavailable peers? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [Unvalidated protocol preferences] Are direct_send_protocols_and_preferences and rpc_protocols_and_preferences validated during construction, or can empty/invalid protocol lists cause runtime panics during message routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency manipulation] Can malicious peers report fake low latency values through peer_monitoring_metadata to get prioritized for consensus messages, enabling them to influence block proposal selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Connection ID collision] If two peers attempt to connect with the same ConnectionId (due to ID reuse or wraparound), can this cause connection metadata corruption where one peer's metadata overwrites another's? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Race condition on peer insertion] Can concurrent calls to insert_connection_metadata() for the same peer cause race conditions where connection metadata is partially updated, leading to inconsistent peer state? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: remove_peer_metadata()] [Connection ID mismatch exploitation] Can an attacker exploit the connection_id validation in remove_peer_metadata() by triggering disconnects with stale connection IDs, preventing legitimate peer cleanup and causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: remove_peer_metadata()] [Disconnect notification race] When remove_peer_metadata() broadcasts LostPeer events, can race conditions cause applications to receive NewPeer and LostPeer events out of order, corrupting application state? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: update_connection_state()] [State transition validation] Does update_connection_state() validate legal state transitions (Connected -> Disconnecting -> Disconnected), or can malicious code force invalid transitions like Disconnected -> Connected without proper connection establishment? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: update_peer_monitoring_metadata()] [Metadata injection] Can malicious applications call update_peer_monitoring_metadata() with fake latency/health data to manipulate peer selection algorithms and bias consensus toward compromised validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: set_cached_peers_and_metadata()] [Cache inconsistency] Can rapid updates to peers_and_metadata cause cached_peers_and_metadata to become stale, where applications read outdated peer lists and send messages to disconnected peers?

  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Subscriber starvation] If one subscriber's channel fills up (hits NOTIFICATION_BACKLOG=1000), messages are silently dropped, can this cause critical applications to miss NewPeer/LostPeer events leading to consensus failures?
