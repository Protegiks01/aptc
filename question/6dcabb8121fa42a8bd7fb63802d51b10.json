  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_script()] [Serialization vulnerability] Can an attacker craft a malicious GasScheduleV2 structure with extreme values that causes bcs::to_bytes() to produce corrupted output, leading to invalid gas schedules being deployed on-chain that break transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_script()] [Data integrity] Does the bcs::to_bytes() call at line 40 properly validate GasScheduleV2 before serialization, or can malformed gas schedules with inconsistent feature_version and entries bypass validation and corrupt on-chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_script()] [Buffer overflow] The assertion at line 42 checks gas_schedule_blob.len() < 65536, but can an attacker construct a gas schedule that passes this check but causes overflow when processed by the Move VM during proposal execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_script()] [Size limit bypass] The 65536 byte limit check at line 42 uses a hard assertion - can this be bypassed by crafting compressed or encoded gas parameters that expand during deserialization on-chain, causing memory exhaustion?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule-updator/src/lib.rs] [Function: generate_script()] [Proposal ID bypass] The generated script at line 71 takes proposal_id as a parameter - can an attacker reuse this script with a different proposal_id to execute unauthorized gas schedule updates?
