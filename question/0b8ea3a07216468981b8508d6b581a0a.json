  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [All functions] [Session exhaustion] Is there a limit on how many concurrent consensus sessions can exist for different (issuer, kid) pairs, or can this be exploited for resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Impl: TConsensusMode] [Trait method consistency] Are the trait method implementations consistent with each other, or can mismatches between new_rb_request() and session_key_from_qc() cause consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Impl: TConsensusMode] [Type safety] Do the associated types (ConsensusSessionKey, ReliableBroadcastRequest) provide sufficient type safety, or can they be confused with similar types from other modes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Impl: TConsensusMode] [Missing validation] Does the trait require implementations to validate inputs, or is validation optional, creating potential security gaps? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Function: log_certify_done()] [False certification logging] Can log_certify_done() be called with QCs that never actually achieved quorum, misleading operators about consensus state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Function: log_certify_start()] [Sensitive data leakage] Does logging base_version, issuer, and kid expose information that could help attackers time their attacks on JWK updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Function: log_certify_done()] [Log tampering] If logs are the only audit trail for consensus, can attackers manipulate what gets logged to hide their attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Function: log_certify_start(), log_certify_done()] [Log parsing vulnerabilities] Can malicious issuer/kid values contain escape sequences or formatting that breaks log parsing tools? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/per_key.rs] [Function: new_rb_request()] [JWK parameter validation] Are JWK parameters (e.g., RSA modulus size) validated before initiating consensus, or can invalid JWKs enter consensus? (High)",
