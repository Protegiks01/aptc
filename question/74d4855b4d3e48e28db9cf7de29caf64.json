  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: expansion] [Semantic Bypass] Can the expansion module at line 13 be exploited to expand Move macros or generics in ways that bypass type checking, allowing unsafe casts or resource duplication that violates Move's linear type system? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: verification] [Safety Violation] Does the verification module at line 19 perform complete verification of Move invariants, or could malicious code slip through that violates resource uniqueness, enabling double-spending of tokens on Aptos?

(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: compiled_unit] [Module Verification] Does the compiled_unit module at line 11 properly validate module dependencies and signatures, or could circular dependencies or signature mismatches lead to runtime panics or undefined behavior in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Error Suppression] Can attackers manipulate the diagnostics module at line 12 to suppress critical compilation errors or warnings, allowing deployment of unsafe Move code that would normally be rejected?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Module: command_line] [Command Injection] Does the command_line module at line 10 properly sanitize command-line arguments, or can shell injection or path traversal attacks be used to compromise the compilation process?
