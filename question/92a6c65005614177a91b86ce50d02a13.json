  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/multi_ed25519.rs] [Function: From<&MultiEd25519PrivateKey>] [Threshold Copying] The threshold is directly copied at line 275. If private_key.threshold was maliciously set to 0 or invalid value, is this propagated to the public key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/multi_ed25519.rs] [Function: From<&MultiEd25519PrivateKey>] [Tag Missing] This conversion also doesn't add ValidatedPublicKeyTag. Can derived public keys be used without proper validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/multi_ed25519.rs] [Function: From<Ed25519Signature>] [Bitmap Hardcoding] At line 554, bitmap is hardcoded as [0b1000_0000u8, 0u8, 0u8, 0u8], representing only the first bit set. Can this be exploited if the conversion is used in wrong contexts? (Low)",

If used with a public key having threshold > 1, will verification fail correctly? (Low)",

If two different public key sets produce the same byte representation, can this cause hash collisions in HashMaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/multi_ed25519.rs] [Function: std::hash::Hash for MultiEd25519PublicKey] [Serialization Dependency] The hash depends on to_bytes(). If to_bytes() is non-deterministic or has bugs, can this cause inconsistent hashing? (Medium)",

If malleable signatures exist, can two valid but different byte representations hash differently, breaking signature caching? (High)",
