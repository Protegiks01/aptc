  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [Addresses vector] The addresses are stored in a Vec - can providing multiple addresses for the same peer cause connection racing or allow attackers to provide both legitimate and malicious addresses to enable downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: build_seed_peer()] [PeerId vs AccountAddress] Is there proper validation that the PeerId derived from account_address matches the account that controls the public_key, or can an attacker associate any public key with any account address? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: MAINNET_SEED_PEERS] [Single point of failure] With only 1 mainnet seed peer, can an attacker perform a targeted attack on node1.cloud-b.mainnet.aptoslabs.com to prevent all new mainnet nodes from bootstrapping, causing a complete network outage for new joiners? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: MAINNET_SEED_PEERS] [DNS hijacking] The seed peer uses /dns/ instead of /ip4/ - can an attacker perform DNS poisoning on node1.cloud-b.mainnet.aptoslabs.com to redirect all new nodes to malicious infrastructure and perform large-scale eclipse attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: MAINNET_SEED_PEERS] [Hardcoded credentials] The public key 0x003cc2ed36e7d486539ac2c411b48d962f1ef17d884c3a7109cad43f16bd5008 is hardcoded - if the corresponding private key is compromised, can an attacker impersonate the seed peer and MITM all new node connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: MAINNET_SEED_PEERS] [Account address verification] Can the account address 568fdb6acf26aae2a84419108ff13baa3ebf133844ef18e23a9f47b5af16b698 be verified on-chain, or is this a trusted assumption that could be violated if the seed peer operators don't control this account? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: TESTNET_SEED_PEERS] [Multiple DNS targets] With 4 testnet seeds all using seed0-3.testnet.aptoslabs.com, can an attacker compromise aptoslabs.com DNS to redirect all testnet traffic, effectively controlling the entire testnet for new joiners? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: TESTNET_SEED_PEERS] [Public key rotation] If any of the 4 testnet seed public keys need to be rotated due to compromise, does this require a code change and deployment, creating a long window where compromised keys remain trusted? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: TESTNET_SEED_PEERS] [Port 6182] All seeds use TCP port 6182 - can an attacker perform targeted port blocking or DPI to prevent connections to all seed peers simultaneously, isolating new nodes from the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constants: ALL_SEED_PEERS] [Update mechanism] Are these seed peer constants updatable through on-chain governance, or do they require source code changes? Can outdated seeds cause network splits if seed operators migrate infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Constant: IDENTITY_KEY_FILE] [Filename prediction] The constant 'ephemeral_identity_key' uses a predictable name - can an attacker pre-create this file with a known private key before node initialization to control the node's network identity? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between checking if the identity file exists (load_identity) and saving the key, can an attacker create/modify the file in a race condition to either steal the generated key or force the node to use an attacker-controlled key? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 220-232] [Pattern match completeness] The pattern match only handles Identity::FromConfig with AutoGenerated source - are there other Identity variants that should also have their keys persisted? Can attackers exploit uncovered patterns to cause key loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [Error handling] If Identity::load_identity() returns Ok(None), the code proceeds to save the auto-generated key - but if saving fails, is the error silently ignored, allowing the node to start with a non-persistent identity? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 220-232] [Key rotation] Once an identity key is saved to disk, is there any mechanism to rotate it? Can long-lived keys become vulnerable over time, and can attackers exploit the lack of rotation to compromise older nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 204-214] [ChainId bypass] Can an attacker provide a ChainId that returns true for both is_testnet() and is_mainnet() to load both seed sets simultaneously, potentially creating a confused node that connects to both networks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 204-214] [Custom ChainId] Can an attacker provide a custom ChainId that matches neither testnet nor mainnet to prevent any seeds from being added, forcing the node to rely entirely on user-provided seeds for bootstrap? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 204-214] [None ChainId] If chain_id is None, no seeds are added - can an attacker force chain_id to be None to create isolated nodes that cannot join any network, leading to network fragmentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize()] [ChainId inconsistency] Can different sub-config optimizers receive different chain_id values if the parameter is modified during optimization, leading to inconsistent configurations across consensus, storage, and network layers? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 198-199] [Array indexing] Accessing local_config_yaml['full_node_networks'][index] without validating the YAML structure - can a malformed YAML with 'full_node_networks' as a scalar instead of array cause a panic? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 203] [Null vs undefined] The check .is_null() may not detect missing keys vs explicitly null values - can an attacker use YAML anchors/aliases to bypass null checks and prevent seed addition while appearing to have no local seeds configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 248] [YAML key mismatch] The key 'validator_network_config' in YAML may not match the actual struct field name - can mismatched keys cause the optimizer to incorrectly think values are user-provided when they're actually defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 252, 258] [Type coercion] Does the YAML parser properly validate that network_id and mutual_authentication have the expected types, or can an attacker provide strings/numbers that get coerced, bypassing the .is_null() checks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [General YAML handling] [Injection attacks] Can an attacker use YAML injection techniques (e.g., embedding code in strings, using custom tags) to bypass config validation and inject malicious configurations that the optimizer doesn't detect? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 111-152] [Early error exit] When sub-config optimizers are called sequentially, if ConsensusConfig::optimize() fails, does the function immediately return the error without attempting to optimize remaining configs, leaving them in insecure default states? (High)"
