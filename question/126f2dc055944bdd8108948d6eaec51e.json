  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Random account creation] new_account_at(AccountAddress::random()) creates accounts without validation - can predictable randomness lead to address collisions or privilege escalation in benchmarks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Package handler initialization] PackageHandler::new() loads pre-built packages - can malicious packages be injected into pre_built_packages() to deploy backdoored code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Package publishing without signature verification] Packages are published with publish_transaction_payload() - are package signatures validated, or can unsigned malicious packages be deployed in benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [ChainId test configuration] Packages use ChainId::test() - does this differ from production chain IDs in security-critical ways that could allow mainnet attacks not caught in tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Initialization entry point execution] initialize_entry_point() is called without validation - can malicious initialization functions corrupt global state in ways that affect subsequent benchmarks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Iteration count selection logic] Iterations are chosen based on expected_time_micros thresholds - can attackers manipulate expected times to force low iteration counts that miss intermittent bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error detection failure] had_error() is checked but error details aren't logged - can silent errors in entry point execution hide security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Gas calculation manipulation] execution_gas_units() and io_gas_units() are reported but not validated - can entry points underreport gas usage to bypass gas limit checks in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Performance regression thresholds] ALLOWED_REGRESSION (15%) and ALLOWED_IMPROVEMENT (15%) are hardcoded - are these values sufficient to catch subtle DoS attacks that increase execution time by 10-14%? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Regression detection bypasses] The max_regression calculation uses max() to compare allowed regression with calibration ratio - can this allow larger regressions than intended if calibration ratios are manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Improvement detection false positives] Performance improvements trigger failures - does this prevent legitimate optimizations from being deployed, or does it hide cases where 'improvements' are actually test manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [JSON output manipulation] JSON lines are printed to stdout - can attackers inject malicious JSON that exploits log parsing tools or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error log count validation] ERROR_LOG_COUNT.get() is checked at the end - can error logs be suppressed or cleared during execution to hide security violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Exit code handling] The program exits with exit(1) on failure - can CI systems be configured to ignore exit codes, allowing failing benchmarks to merge? (Low)",
