(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/mod.rs] [Trait: Transport] [Implementation] [Trait method ordering] Can implementations rely on specific calling orders of listen_on() and dial(), and if assumptions are violated, does this create vulnerabilities? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/mod.rs] [Trait: Transport] [Concurrency] [Concurrent listen_on] Can multiple threads call listen_on() concurrently on shared Transport instances, and if so, does this create race conditions in address binding or port allocation? (Medium)",
