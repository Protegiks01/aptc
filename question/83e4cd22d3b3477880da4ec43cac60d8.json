  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Type Safety] [Cross-Network Messages] While NetworkId is strongly typed, can serialized messages be deserialized with wrong NetworkId, allowing validator-only messages to be accepted on public network, bypassing authentication checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Type Safety] [Role-Network Mismatches] Nothing prevents creating NetworkContext with RoleType::FullNode and NetworkId::Validator. Can such invalid combinations be exploited to have full nodes masquerade as validators in networking handshakes? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Missing Validation] The function accepts only three valid strings but provides generic error. Can attackers probe valid network names through brute force, or does generic error enable timing attacks to distinguish valid prefixes? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: as_str()] [String Immutability] Returned strings are immutable &str. Can const propagation or compiler optimizations make different NetworkId instances share string storage, creating covert channels for information leakage between network contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Serialization] [Dual Format Period] Comments indicate 'once all validators & VFNs are on this version'. Can attackers exploit the migration period where both old (Private) and new (Vfn) formats are accepted to send ambiguous messages that validators interpret differently? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Deserialization] [Private String Arbitrary] ConvertNetworkId::Private accepts any String. Can attackers send Private(\\",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Serialization] [NewPublic Variant] Deserialization handles ConvertNetworkId::NewPublic mapping to NetworkId::Public. Can this create confusion where different nodes use Public vs NewPublic representations, causing network split during migration? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Logging DoS] Display implementations allocate strings for logging. Can attackers trigger excessive logging of NetworkContext or PeerNetworkId to cause memory exhaustion, especially if peer_id strings are large? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Serialization Cost] Custom serialize() implementation creates intermediate ConvertNetworkId enum. Can repeated serialization in hot paths cause performance degradation, making validators slower in consensus protocol? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Deserialization Complexity] Deserialization handles multiple legacy formats. Can attackers send malformed messages requiring complex deserialization paths to slow down message processing and degrade consensus performance? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: upstream_roles()] [PreferredUpstream Abuse] Public network accepts PreferredUpstream as highest priority. Can attackers register as PreferredUpstream to monopolize upstream connection slots on validators, causing eclipse attacks by blocking honest peer connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Function: downstream_roles()] [Unknown Peer DoS] Public network accepts Unknown peers as lowest priority downstream. Can unlimited unknown peers connect and consume connection slots, preventing legitimate downstream clients from receiving state updates? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Overall Design] [No Handshake Validation] The comment states 'handshakes should verify that the NetworkId being used is the same'. Can missing handshake validation in networking code allow cross-network connections where both peers claim different NetworkIds? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Overall Design] [Default Network Check] Comment says 'Network should be checked that it is not the DEFAULT_NETWORK'. Can failure to perform this check allow default-initialized network contexts to participate in validator consensus? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Memory] [Copy Trait Safety] NetworkId and NetworkContext are Copy types. Can memory corruption from buffer overflows elsewhere overwrite NetworkId values in stack frames, causing running validators to suddenly switch network identities? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/network_id.rs] [Memory] [Struct Padding] NetworkContext contains role (likely u8), network_id (u8), and peer_id (likely 32 bytes). Can uninitialized padding bytes between fields leak sensitive memory contents when NetworkContext is serialized? (Low)"
