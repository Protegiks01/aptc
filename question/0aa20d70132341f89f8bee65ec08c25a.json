  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Peer ID Spoofing] Can a Byzantine validator craft a malicious PeerId that bypasses validator set verification, allowing them to inject DKG transcript requests from unauthorized peers and corrupt the DKG ceremony? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Identity Confusion] Does send_rpc() validate that the target peer PeerId is actually part of the current validator set before sending DKG messages, or can an attacker send DKG transcripts to arbitrary peers causing protocol confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [Network ID Hardcoding] The function always returns NetworkId::Validator regardless of actual peer network membership - can an attacker exploit this to send DKG messages to non-validator nodes or cross-network attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Peer ID Validation] Does send_rpc_raw() perform any validation on the peer PeerId before sending raw bytes, or can a Byzantine validator target non-existent peers to cause resource exhaustion or protocol errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Peer List Validation] Can an attacker provide a malicious peers vector containing duplicate PeerIds, causing the same DKG message to be sent multiple times and potentially corrupting aggregation logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Empty Peer List] What happens if an empty peers vector is provided - does this cause DKG to fail silently without sending required transcripts, breaking the DKG ceremony? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Message Authentication] Does send_rpc() verify that DKGMessage contains valid cryptographic signatures before transmission, or can unsigned/forged messages be sent to peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response Validation] When send_rpc() receives a DKGMessage response, is the response cryptographically verified to be from the expected peer, or can a Byzantine validator perform response substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw Bytes Injection] Can send_rpc_raw() be exploited to send malformed bytes that bypass DKGMessage deserialization checks, potentially causing crashes or undefined behavior in the receiver? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Type Confusion] Does send_rpc_raw() validate that raw bytes deserialize to a valid DKGMessage before sending, or can attackers send arbitrary data causing deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization Consistency] Can inconsistent serialization across different protocol encodings (Compressed/Bcs/Json) cause validators to process different DKG transcript data, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Constants: RPC protocols] [Protocol Downgrade] Can a Byzantine validator force use of less secure protocols (Json over Compressed) to enable parsing vulnerabilities or inject malicious data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator provide extremely large rpc_timeout values causing resource exhaustion, or zero/negative timeouts causing immediate failures and DKG ceremony abortion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout Racing] If multiple validators call send_rpc() concurrently with different timeout values, can race conditions cause some requests to timeout prematurely, breaking DKG threshold requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Timeout Bypass] Does send_rpc_raw() enforce the same timeout constraints as send_rpc(), or can it bypass timeout limits to cause indefinite blocking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Selective Timeout] Can a Byzantine validator respond to honest validators within timeout but delay responses to specific peers, causing asymmetric DKG transcript collection and protocol failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout Error Handling] When send_rpc() times out, does error handling properly distinguish between network failures vs. Byzantine behavior, or can attackers exploit timeout errors to frame honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Epoch Confusion] Can a Byzantine validator send DKG messages with mismatched epoch numbers (from DKGMessage::epoch()) causing validators to process outdated or future epoch transcripts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Epoch Transition Race] During epoch transitions, can race conditions in send_rpc() cause DKG messages to be sent with stale validator sets, breaking DKG for the new epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Cross-Epoch Messages] Can to_bytes_by_protocol() serialize messages for peers that are in different epochs, causing validators to aggregate transcripts from wrong validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [Epoch Stale Peers] Does get_peer_network_id_for_peer() validate that peer is in the current epoch's validator set, or can it return network IDs for removed/inactive validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Struct: DKGNetworkClient] [Clone Safety] DKGNetworkClient implements Clone - can concurrent clones cause race conditions when multiple async tasks call send_rpc() simultaneously, corrupting network state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent RPC] Can multiple concurrent send_rpc() calls to the same peer cause message ordering issues or response confusion, where validator A receives validator B's DKG transcript response? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Concurrent Serialization] If to_bytes_by_protocol() is called concurrently for the same DKGMessage, can race conditions in serialization produce different byte representations for different peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Concurrent Sorting] Can concurrent calls to sort_peers_by_latency() cause data races on the peers slice, leading to undefined behavior or incorrect peer ordering? (Medium)"
