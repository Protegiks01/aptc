  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Blocking pool size] Does spawn_blocking() respect tokio's max_blocking_threads configuration, or could it exceed limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: new()] [Handle lifecycle] What happens if the Handle's runtime is dropped while the BoundedExecutor still exists? Could this cause panics during spawn()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Runtime metrics] Does spawning through BoundedExecutor bypass tokio's runtime metrics, making monitoring and debugging harder? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Worker thread affinity] Could blocking tasks be scheduled on the wrong thread pools, affecting CPU affinity-sensitive operations like cryptography? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn()] [Future size] If spawned futures are extremely large, could this cause stack overflow during spawn() or excessive memory usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: try_spawn()] [Spurious capacity checks] Could try_spawn() return false negatives (capacity available but try_acquire fails) due to race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Function: spawn_blocking()] [Closure lifetime] Are the 'static bounds on closures in spawn_blocking() sufficient to prevent use-after-free with captured references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/executor.rs] [Struct: BoundedExecutor] [Clone vs new] Should Clone be implemented, or could shared semaphore state between clones cause unexpected behavior when used in different contexts? (Medium)",
