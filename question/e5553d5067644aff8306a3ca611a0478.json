  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [All Constants] [Comment warning] The file states 'Almost all of these values are educated guesses, and not determined using any empirical data' - can this lack of empirical validation mean the constants are set incorrectly for real-world Byzantine attack scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [All Constants] [Constant visibility] Are these constants marked as 'pub const', making them visible across the entire codebase - can external crates or modules misuse these constants in ways that violate security assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [All Constants] [Constant modification] Can a malicious insider or compromised build process modify these constant values before compilation to weaken network security (e.g., increasing MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE to enable larger attacks)? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [All Constants] [Type safety] Are the constant types (u64, u32, usize) appropriate for their uses, or can type conversions when using these constants cause integer overflow/truncation vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/constants.rs] [All Constants] [Constant ranges] Are there any validation checks in the codebase that ensure these constants are within safe ranges (e.g., MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE < available_memory), or are they used blindly? (High)"
