  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [State transitions] Are there atomic state transition guarantees when CoinInfo is modified, or can partial updates leave the resource in an inconsistent state if a transaction aborts mid-execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Limit overflow] Can limit parameter of u128::MAX cause overflow when aggregator performs arithmetic operations like incrementing supply, leading to supply tracking corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Supply overflow] If supply parameter is u128::MAX, can BCS encoding or downstream aggregator operations overflow when processing this maximum value? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Resource deletion] Are there protections preventing CoinInfoResource from being deleted while coins of that type still exist, which would orphan coin balances and break coin operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Resource modification] Can CoinInfoResource fields be modified after creation in ways that violate Move coin module invariants, such as changing decimals after coins have been minted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: symbol()] [Memory leak] Does clone() on potentially large symbol Vec<u8> create memory leaks if the cloned data is not properly dropped, especially in long-running validator processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker create many CoinInfoResource instances with maximum-sized name/symbol fields to exhaust validator memory and cause out-of-memory crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Resource leak] Does to_writeset() properly clean up allocated resources if bcs::to_bytes() or WriteSetMut operations fail, or can failures cause memory leaks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Freeze panic] Can WriteSetMut::freeze().unwrap() panic if the writeset is invalid, and if so, what conditions cause invalid writesets that would crash validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: symbol()] [Error propagation] Is FromUtf8Error from symbol() properly propagated to callers, or are there code paths that unwrap the Result causing panics on invalid UTF-8? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: random()] [Test code leak] Can random() be accidentally called in production code paths, introducing non-determinism that breaks consensus when validators generate different CoinInfo resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Test helper abuse] Does new() have sufficient guards preventing its use outside of testing contexts, or can it be exploited to create fake CoinInfo resources in production? (High)",
