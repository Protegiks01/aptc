  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: delete_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate()] [Liveness attack] Can delete_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate() be called by an attacker to erase valid timeout certificates, preventing validators from properly advancing rounds and causing consensus liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate()] [Buffer overflow] Is the Vec<u8> timeout certificate size validated before storage, or can excessively large TCs cause memory exhaustion or storage issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_highest_2chain_timeout_certificate()] [Missing error handling] Does line 164-166 properly handle database read errors, or can transient DB errors be misinterpreted as missing TCs, causing incorrect consensus behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Empty data bypass] Can the empty check on line 127 be bypassed by passing empty collections that satisfy is_empty() but contain invalid data structures, allowing database corruption? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: delete_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Race condition] Can concurrent delete and save operations on the same block IDs cause race conditions where blocks are partially deleted or resurrected, leading to consensus state inconsistency?

  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates()] [Block validation missing] Does save_blocks_and_quorum_certificates() validate block signatures, parent hashes, or round numbers before storage, or can invalid blocks be persisted? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_data()] [Missing blocks/QCs] Can get_all() on lines 91-100 fail to retrieve some blocks or QCs due to concurrent deletions, returning incomplete consensus state that breaks recovery? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensusdb/mod.rs] [Function: get_data()] [Iterator exhaustion] Can get_all() calls on lines 91-100 hang or consume excessive memory if the database contains millions of blocks, causing validator startup failures? (Medium)",
