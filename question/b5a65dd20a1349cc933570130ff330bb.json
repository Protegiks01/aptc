(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/ordered_transaction_by_account/mod.rs] [Replay Protection] [Historical Sequence Manipulation] Can old transactions be re-indexed with modified sequence numbers to break the chronological ordering of an account's transaction history? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/ordered_transaction_by_account/mod.rs] [Validation] [AccountAddress Format Bypass] Can non-standard AccountAddress formats bypass validation in decode_key and be written to the database, causing future decode failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/ordered_transaction_by_account/mod.rs] [Concurrency] [Read-Write Race] Can concurrent encode_key and decode_key operations on the same data cause race conditions if the underlying storage doesn't provide proper isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/ordered_transaction_by_account/mod.rs] [Concurrency] [Iterator Invalidation] If the schema is modified while an iterator is traversing account transactions, can this cause iterator invalidation and incorrect query results? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/ordered_transaction_by_account/mod.rs] [Data Integrity] [Version Tampering] Can stored Version values be modified directly in the database without going through the schema, bypassing any validation and breaking transaction index integrity?
