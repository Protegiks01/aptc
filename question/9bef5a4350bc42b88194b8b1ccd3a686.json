  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [CompiledModule Lifetime] The compiled_module on line 51 is created and then accessed for module_id on line 52 - are there any use-after-free risks if the compiled_module is moved while references to its contents are still used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Address Dereference] Line 62 uses *address to dereference the address - is this dereference safe in all contexts, or could there be null pointer scenarios in malformed modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [BuildOptions Default] The BuildOptions uses ..BuildOptions::default() on line 44 - are the default options secure for untrusted packages, or could they enable dangerous compilation features? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Source Maps Exposure] with_source_maps: true on line 41 - could this expose sensitive source code location information if benchmark results are shared publicly? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Module Import] [Helper Module Trust] Line 4 imports the helper module - is the helper module in the same trust boundary, or could malicious modifications to helper.rs compromise benchmark integrity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/main.rs] [Helper Call] [Address Conversion] Line 62 passes *address which dereferences an AccountAddress - could there be integer overflow or truncation issues in how addresses are represented internally? (Low)"
