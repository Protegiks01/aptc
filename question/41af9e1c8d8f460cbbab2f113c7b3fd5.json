  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Configuration tampering] Can an attacker who gains control of the NodeConfig before port zeroing occurs preserve malicious port assignments that bypass OS randomization, potentially enabling port prediction attacks on the local node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Incomplete sanitization] The TODO comment indicates uncertainty about port coverage - could there be additional ports in NodeConfig that are NOT zeroed, allowing an attacker to bind to predictable ports and intercept network traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Network address manipulation] Does the hardcoded IP '0.0.0.0' binding for validator and full_node networks create a security risk by exposing services on all interfaces instead of localhost only, potentially allowing remote connections in development environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Race condition] Can multiple threads call zero_all_ports() concurrently on the same NodeConfig, causing partial port configurations and non-deterministic network binding behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Null pointer dereference] If validator_network is None but the node is configured as a validator, does skipping port zeroing create a state where the node starts with invalid network configuration leading to crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Iterator mutation] Can modifications to full_node_networks during iteration cause memory safety issues or panic, especially if async tasks are concurrently accessing the config? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Unwrap on parse] The IP address parsing uses unwrap() - could malformed internal constants or memory corruption cause this to panic during node startup, creating a denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Protocol construction] The NetworkAddress construction with Protocol::Ip4 and Protocol::Tcp could fail with unwrap() - are there edge cases where the protocol vector construction panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: get_data_service_url()] [URL injection] Can an attacker provide a malicious indexer_grpc_port value that creates an invalid or exploitable URL when parsed, potentially enabling SSRF attacks against local services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: get_data_service_url()] [Integer overflow] If indexer_grpc_port is set to u16::MAX or other boundary values, does the URL formatting handle this correctly without truncation or wraparound issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: get_data_service_url()] [Unwrap panic] The Url::parse() call uses unwrap() - can format string issues or unexpected port values cause this to panic, creating a DoS vector? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: get_data_service_url()] [Localhost binding] The hardcoded IP_LOCAL_HOST binding prevents Docker container access - could this create security assumptions that break when the function is misused in containerized environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Entropy source manipulation] The RNG uses StdRng::from_entropy() - can an attacker with local access manipulate the entropy source to create predictable node configurations or cryptographic material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Path traversal] The test_dir parameter is directly used without sanitization - can an attacker provide a malicious path that causes load_node_config to read/write sensitive files outside the intended directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker who controls the test_dir provide a malicious node config file that bypasses security checks in load_node_config, potentially enabling validator impersonation or network attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Config parameter bypass] The function passes hardcoded None values for multiple config parameters - could these defaults create insecure configurations that skip important validation or security features? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Framework package manipulation] The aptos_cached_packages::head_release_bundle() provides the Move framework - can an attacker replace this with a malicious framework that contains backdoored system modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Config mutation after validation] After load_node_config returns a validated config, it's mutated by zero_all_ports and other settings - can this post-validation mutation introduce security issues that bypass config sanitization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Indexer forced enablement] The function forcibly enables indexer_grpc regardless of the loaded config - could this create resource exhaustion or expose unintended services in production-like test environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Table info service mode] Setting TableInfoServiceMode::IndexingOnly bypasses certain checks - could this mode enable state manipulation or inconsistent data in the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [IP address override] IP addresses are set to IP_LOCAL_HOST after config loading - can this create security mismatches where the node trusts connections on wrong interfaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Admin service exposure] The admin_service.address is set to localhost - if IP_LOCAL_HOST is misconfigured, could this expose privileged admin APIs to the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Inspection service exposure] Similar to admin service, the inspection_service could expose internal node state if the IP binding is incorrect - can this leak sensitive validator information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Channel race condition] The oneshot channels for port reporting are created and passed to different threads - can a race condition cause the channels to be used after being consumed, leading to panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Channel drop without send] If start_and_report_ports fails to send on the oneshot channels before erroring, the receivers will get RecvError - is this handled correctly, or can it cause the futures to hang indefinitely? (Medium)"
