  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Constant: POSTGRES_IMAGE] [Image verification missing] The code doesn't verify image signatures or digests - can a compromised Docker registry serve a malicious postgres:14.11 image that contains backdoors or data exfiltration code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Constant: POSTGRES_IMAGE] [Tag immutability] Using a tag like '14.11' instead of a digest means the image could change - can the image be updated upstream with malicious code while keeping the same tag, introducing vulnerabilities without code changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: create_container_options_and_config()] [Base image vulnerabilities] The postgres:14.11 image is based on Debian - can vulnerabilities in the base OS layer be exploited even if PostgreSQL itself is secure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Graceful shutdown missing] There's no explicit SIGTERM or graceful shutdown before cleanup - can abrupt container termination cause PostgreSQL to leave the database in an inconsistent state requiring crash recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: fut_postgres_clean_up] [Cleanup error handling] Cleanup operations use _ = expression, silently ignoring errors - can this hide critical cleanup failures like volume deletion errors that eventually fill the disk? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Cleanup ordering dependency] The cleanup must run fut_create_postgres first before accessing container cleanup - can this requirement be violated under high load or rapid cancellation, causing cleanup to hang indefinitely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_connection_string()] [Connection string format assumptions] The connection string format assumes postgres:// URL scheme - if the underlying connection library changes requirements, can this cause authentication failures or downgrades to insecure connections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Health checker assumptions] The HealthChecker::Postgres is an external dependency - can implementation changes in the health checker cause false positives or negatives that hide database failures or delay startup unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [No retry logic] Container creation and startup have no retry mechanisms - can transient Docker API failures cause permanent workspace creation failures that require manual intervention? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Arc reference cycles] Multiple Arc clones and Mutex sharing - can improper reference management create cycles that prevent proper cleanup and cause memory leaks as workspaces are created and destroyed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: start_postgres()] [Future cancellation safety] Multiple futures are cloned and awaited - can improper cancellation handling cause use-after-free or double-free issues when futures are dropped during shutdown? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/postgres.rs] [Function: get_postgres_assigned_port()] [Option unwrap chain] The function chains multiple .and_then() calls - can this deeply nested option handling hide logic errors that cause incorrect port extraction in edge cases? (Low)"
