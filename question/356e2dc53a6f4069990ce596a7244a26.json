  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/constant_time/blstrs_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: build_and_run_bench()] [Timing attack] Can an attacker exploit the scalar multiplication timing differences between low-hamming-weight scalars (1-4 bits set) and high-hamming-weight scalars (200 bits set) to extract private keys through remote timing observations, leading to complete loss of validator funds and consensus compromise? (Critical)",
