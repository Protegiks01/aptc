  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: fund()] [Concurrent Funding Attack] If multiple clients call fund() simultaneously for the same address, can race conditions in transaction sequencing cause double-funding or allow bypassing rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Transaction Status Confusion] Does wait_for_signed_transaction distinguish between transaction success and failure, or can a failed account creation be treated as success, causing fund() to fail later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the error at line 69 expose sensitive information about faucet server internal state, authentication tokens, or blockchain state that attackers could use for reconnaissance? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: fund()] [Nonce Manipulation] Does the faucet server properly increment sequence numbers for each transaction, or can attackers exploit nonce reuse to replay funding transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: new()] [URL Validation] Does the constructor at line 19 validate that faucet_url and rest_url are HTTPS and point to trusted domains, or can attackers force cleartext communication or MITM attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: new_for_testing()] [Version Path Bypass] Does setting version_path_base to '/' at line 34 create security issues where API version checks are bypassed, allowing access to deprecated or vulnerable endpoints? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Struct: FaucetClient] [Field Visibility] Are the public fields at lines 12-15 properly encapsulated, or can external code directly modify faucet_url or token to bypass security controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/faucet.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Address Format] Does AccountAddress.to_string() or format! at line 62 properly encode special addresses like 0x0, 0x1, or system addresses that should be restricted? (High)",
