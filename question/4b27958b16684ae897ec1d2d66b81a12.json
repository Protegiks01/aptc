(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Function: with_legacy_signer()] [Backward Compatibility Attack] Can the legacy_signer flag be exploited to serialize signer values in an insecure legacy format that bypasses modern security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Function: with_func_args_deserialization()] [Extension Injection] Can an attacker provide a malicious FunctionValueExtension reference that gets stored in the context and used for arbitrary function deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Function: with_delayed_fields_replacement()] [Mapping Corruption] If the ValueToIdentifierMapping implementation is malicious or buggy, can it corrupt state by providing incorrect mappings between values and identifiers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Function: with_delayed_fields_serde()] [Identifier Exposure] When delayed fields are serialized without mapping (mapping: None), are delayed field identifiers exposed in a way that breaks determinism or leaks sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Trait: ValueToIdentifierMapping] [Double-Spending] Can value_to_identifier() be called multiple times with the same value to generate different DelayedFieldIDs, enabling double-spending of delayed resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Trait: ValueToIdentifierMapping] [State Inconsistency] If identifier_to_value() returns different values for the same DelayedFieldID across multiple calls, can this cause non-deterministic execution across validators?
