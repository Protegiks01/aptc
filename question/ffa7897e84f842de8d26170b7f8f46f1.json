  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Serialization format] What format does ErrorMapping::to_file() use, and could changes to the serialization format break compatibility with existing error map parsers? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Prefix matching] If a constant name is exactly equal to error_prefix (e.g., just 'E'), does starts_with() match it, and should such constants be considered errors or excluded? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Module order] Does the order of processing the error module vs other modules matter, or could race conditions cause error categories to be defined after module errors are processed? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: name_string()] [Symbol interning] Is the symbol pool properly shared across all module environments, or could different modules have different symbol pools causing string comparison failures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Constant: MOVE_ERROR_DESC_EXTENSION] [File extension] What is the actual value of MOVE_ERROR_DESC_EXTENSION, and could it be a dangerous extension like '.sh' or '.exe' that could be executed? (Low)"
