  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify_addresses_in_package()] [Conflict Detection Bypass] When checking for non-unique dev addresses, can an attacker provide addresses that differ by only a single bit, hoping to exploit integer comparison vs. hash comparison differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify_addresses_in_package()] [Root Package Check Bypass] The is_root_package flag controls dev address handling - can an attacker manipulate dependency resolution order to make their malicious package appear as root, gaining dev address privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify_addresses_in_package()] [Memory Exhaustion] Building addr_to_name_mapping creates vectors for each address - can an attacker provide many addresses mapping to many names, causing O(N*M) memory usage and OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Unresolved Address Bypass] The function collects unresolved addresses but can an attacker craft addresses that appear resolved due to Some() wrapper but actually contain invalid or zero addresses that break execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Filter Map Timing] When using filter_map() to collect resolved addresses, can an attacker exploit timing between None check and Some() extraction to inject malicious addresses via race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Error Message Injection] Unresolved addresses are joined with newlines in error messages - can an attacker inject escape sequences or terminal control codes in address names that corrupt error output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Path Disclosure] Error messages include root_package_path.to_string_lossy() - can this leak sensitive filesystem information about validator node structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Partial Resolution State] If bail! occurs, the ResolvingGraph is dropped - can an attacker exploit partially resolved state leaking through Rc references that outlive the graph? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Dev Mode Suggestion] The error suggests using --dev flag - can an attacker exploit this to trick users into building production code in dev mode with untrusted dev addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify()] [Concurrent Modification] The function uses borrow_mut() on RefCell - can concurrent calls from multiple threads cause data races when modifying the shared value through different Rc clones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify()] [Reassignment Bypass] The code checks if current_value != &addr_val, but can an attacker exploit floating point comparison or address normalization differences to assign different addresses that appear equal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify()] [None Override] When address_opt is None, unify returns Ok() without checking - can an attacker exploit this to pass None repeatedly, delaying actual address assignment until after security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify()] [Borrow State Leak] If borrow_mut() panics due to existing borrow, can the RefCell be left in an inconsistent state, affecting future unification attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: unify()] [Error Message Address Disclosure] Error messages include full addresses with short_str_lossless() - can this leak information about address allocation patterns or private key derivation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: extend_resolution_table()] [RefCell Aliasing] The code compares other.value != addr_value.value by Rc/RefCell pointer equality - can an attacker exploit this by creating identical addresses in separate RefCells that fail equality check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: extend_resolution_table()] [Take() Side Effect] The code calls value.take() which moves the value out of Option - can an attacker exploit this side effect to leave addresses in None state after comparison, causing subsequent operations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: extend_resolution_table()] [Insertion Ordering] BTreeMap iteration order is deterministic, but can an attacker craft address names that sort in a specific order to ensure malicious addresses are inserted last, overwriting legitimate ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: extend_resolution_table()] [Panic Recovery] If bail! occurs after value.take(), the RefCell is left with None - can an attacker trigger errors to corrupt the resolution table, then exploit the corrupted state in retry attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: extend_resolution_table()] [Dependency Name Injection] Error messages include dep_name from user input - can an attacker inject format specifiers or control characters that exploit logging systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [Source Path Manipulation] When building source_paths list, can an attacker add malicious paths through config that cause digest computation to include/exclude specific files, bypassing integrity checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [Symbolic Link Following] If source paths contain symbolic links, can an attacker use symlinks pointing to different content to cause digest mismatches or include unauthorized files in digest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [TOCTOU Race] Between computing digest and using it, can an attacker modify source files to inject malicious code that won't be detected by digest comparison? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [Dev Mode Digest Difference] In dev_mode, additional paths (Tests, Examples) are included - can an attacker exploit digest differences between dev and production builds to hide malicious code in test files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [Optional Path Handling] When paths are optional and don't exist, they're skipped - can an attacker exploit this to cause different digests across systems depending on which optional directories exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/resolution_graph.rs] [Function: get_package_digest_for_config()] [Manifest Inclusion] The manifest is always included in digest - can an attacker modify only manifest metadata (comments, whitespace) to bypass digest checks while keeping same functional code? (Low)"
