  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: path_in_crate()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious relative path with '../' sequences to escape the CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR boundary and read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially exposing validator private keys or configuration secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: path_in_crate()] [Path Traversal] Does the function validate that the constructed path remains within the crate directory, or can path traversal via '..' components allow access to sensitive system files like /etc/shadow or validator keystores?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_named_addresses()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the BTreeMap construction to inject additional named address mappings that override critical system addresses, potentially redirecting standard library calls to attacker-controlled modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/lib.rs] [Function: move_stdlib_named_addresses()] [Collision Attack] Does the BTreeMap properly handle address collision scenarios where multiple names map to the same address, or can this cause undefined behavior in Move module resolution?
