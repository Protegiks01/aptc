  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Queue Depth Metrics] Can administrators monitor the number of tasks waiting for permits to detect capacity issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Multi-Executor Interaction] If multiple BoundedExecutor instances share the same tokio runtime, can they interfere with each other's task scheduling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Nested Executors] Can BoundedExecutor instances be nested (spawning tasks that create new executors), and does this cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Component Usage] If consensus, execution, and storage components each use separate BoundedExecutor instances, can their interactions cause deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Permit Availability TOCTOU] Between checking permit availability and actually acquiring it, can the state change causing logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/bounded-executor/src/lib.rs] [Capacity Check TOCTOU] If code checks available capacity before calling spawn(), can the capacity be exhausted between the check and the call? (Low)",
