  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Struct: TableHandle] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft a malicious AccountAddress that, when wrapped in TableHandle, collides with legitimate table handles created through native_new_table_handle, allowing unauthorized access to other tables' data and potential fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Struct: TableHandle] [Hash Collision] Does the TableHandle(AccountAddress) wrapper provide sufficient entropy to prevent birthday attacks where an attacker generates 2^128 handles to find collisions, potentially accessing arbitrary table data across different accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Struct: TableHandle] [Serialization Attack] Can the Serialize/Deserialize derivation on TableHandle be exploited to create non-canonical serialization that bypasses state store deduplication, causing state bloat and potential consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Function: size()] [Integer Overflow] Does the size() method at line 16-18 correctly handle all possible AccountAddress sizes, or could a crafted address cause integer overflow when calculating memory requirements for batch operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Input Validation] Can the from_str() implementation at line 21-28 be exploited with malformed input strings to bypass table access controls, especially since it directly delegates to AccountAddress::from_str without additional validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Function: from_str()] [DoS Attack] Does from_str() have bounds on input string length, or can an attacker submit arbitrarily long strings to cause memory exhaustion or CPU-based denial of service during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Trait: From<move_table_extension::TableHandle>] [Type Safety] Can the From conversion at line 30-34 introduce type confusion where a malicious move_table_extension::TableHandle with invalid internal state gets converted to a valid-looking TableHandle, bypassing VM-level validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Trait: From<&move_table_extension::TableHandle>] [Reference Exploit] Does the reference-based From implementation at line 36-40 properly validate the lifetime and mutability constraints, or could it create TableHandles from dangling references leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Struct: TableInfo] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker create a TableInfo with mismatched key_type and value_type TypeTags that pass serialization but cause type safety violations during table operations, leading to arbitrary memory access?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Struct: TableInfo] [Type Validation] Does TableInfo at line 42-47 validate that key_type and value_type are valid, non-malicious TypeTags, or can an attacker inject malformed type information causing VM crashes during table resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Field: key_type] [Type Safety Bypass] Can the key_type field be set to a complex nested TypeTag (e.g., deeply nested generics) that causes stack overflow during type layout computation, allowing DoS or type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Field: value_type] [Resource Safety] Can value_type be set to a TypeTag representing a Move resource type in ways that violate resource safety guarantees, allowing duplication or deletion of unique resources like coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/table.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Determinism] Does the Serialize derivation for TableInfo guarantee deterministic serialization across different Rust versions and platforms, or could serialization non-determinism cause state root divergence? (Critical)",
