  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: serialize_address_str()] [Format Ambiguity] Does to_standard_string() produce a canonical format, or can different address representations (with/without 0x, with/without leading zeros) cause confusion in address matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: deserialize_address_str()] [None Handling] Is the None case properly distinguished from empty strings or invalid addresses, or can attackers exploit this to bypass required address validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: serialize_material_with_prefix()] [AIP-80 Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the to_aip_80_string() serialization to produce output that appears valid but doesn't comply with AIP-80 specification, causing key import/export issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: serialize_material_with_prefix()] [Error Suppression] If to_aip_80_string() returns an error, does S::Error::custom() properly propagate security-relevant error information, or does it hide critical validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: deserialize_material_with_prefix()] [Key Material Injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious encoded string that exploits vulnerabilities in T::from_encoded_string(), potentially loading attacker-controlled cryptographic material? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: deserialize_material_with_prefix()] [Type Confusion] Does the generic ValidCryptoMaterial constraint properly ensure type safety during deserialization, or can mismatched types cause memory corruption or incorrect key usage? (High)"
