  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Empty input] Does try_from handle empty byte slices correctly without panicking or causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: try_from(&[u8])] [Oversized input] Does try_from properly reject byte slices larger than DEALT_PK_NUM_BYTES, or could extra trailing bytes be silently ignored, causing validation bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Function: new()] [Default/zero initialization] Could calling DealtPubKey::new() with a zero or default-initialized GTProjective create an insecure dealt key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [DealtSecretKey relationship] Is there proper validation that a DealtPubKey corresponds to its claimed DealtSecretKey during PVSS reconstruction, or could mismatched keys break threshold cryptography? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Share consistency] When extracting dealt public key shares for individual players, do all shares mathematically combine to the dealt public key, or could inconsistencies break reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Commitment binding] Does the dealt public key cryptographically commit to the polynomial used in PVSS dealing, or could dealers cheat by providing inconsistent commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Hash implementation] Does DealtPubKey properly implement Hash trait for use in hash maps/sets, and is the hash collision-resistant to prevent malicious collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/dealt_pub_key.rs] [Struct: DealtPubKey] [Ordering implementation] If DealtPubKey needs to be sorted (e.g., for deterministic transcript processing), is there a total ordering that is consistent across all validators? (Medium)"
