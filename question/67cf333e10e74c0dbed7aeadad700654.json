  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: build() root verification] [Dummy state exploitation] The assertions allow ACCUMULATOR_PLACEHOLDER_HASH and version==0 - can this allow state sync attacks where dummy state is accepted as real? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Test function: prune_tree()] [Pruning race condition] Can blocks be inserted into branches being pruned, causing dangling references or memory leaks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Test function: prune_tree()] [Root update atomicity] The function updates ordered_root, commit_root, and window_root separately - can partial updates cause inconsistent root states? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Test function: prune_tree()] [Storage pruning failure] If storage.prune_tree() fails but memory structures are updated, can this cause storage bloat and eventual disk exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: update_counters_for_ordered_blocks()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can blocks with manipulated timestamps cause observe_block to record incorrect metrics, hiding consensus delays? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: pipeline_pending_latency()] [Metrics information leak] Do detailed pending latency logs expose internal timing information that could aid timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: sync_info()] [Non-atomic snapshot] The function reads four different values separately - can this return inconsistent SyncInfo that violates consensus invariants? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: get_recent_block_execution_times()] [Traversal termination] Can the loop traverse an extremely long chain if num_blocks is large, causing DoS during execution time queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block()] [Duplicate block handling] Returning existing block on duplicate insert - can this mask attacks where different blocks with same ID are proposed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_committed_block()] [Committed block uniqueness] The ensure checks block doesn't exist - can committed blocks be re-inserted with different execution results? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: get_block_for_round()] [Multiple blocks per round] Can multiple blocks exist at the same round due to forks, and does get_block_for_round return the correct one? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner()] [Author validation bypass] The code expects blocks with payloads to have authors - can NIL blocks or blocks without authors cause panics in the .expect() call? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_single_quorum_cert()] [QC timestamp bypass] Does the function validate QC timestamps match block timestamps, or can QCs with manipulated timestamps be inserted? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: send_for_execution()] [Finality proof validation] Does the function validate the finality proof's signatures and quorum before committing, or can forged proofs cause execution of unconfirmed blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: rebuild()] [Max pruned blocks bypass] Can rebuild with different max_pruned_blocks_in_mem cause inconsistent pruning behavior across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [BlockStore struct] [Payload manager trust] Does the BlockStore validate payload_manager responses, or can a compromised payload manager inject malicious transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner()] [Pipeline builder nullability] Can pipeline_builder being None cause execution to proceed without proper pipeline setup, skipping critical validation? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_2chain_timeout_certificate()] [TC quorum validation] Does the function verify the TC has a valid quorum of signatures from authorized validators, or can minority TCs be inserted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: build()] [Window root validation] Can window_root_block be set to a block that doesn't exist in the tree, causing dangling references? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: send_for_execution()] [Commit info ID validation] Does the function verify that finality_proof.commit_info().id() matches an actual block in the tree before execution? (Critical)",
