  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide malicious abi_directories paths containing '../' sequences to read ABI files from arbitrary filesystem locations outside intended directories, potentially exposing sensitive system files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Traversal] When target_source_dir is specified, can an attacker use path traversal sequences to write generated code files to arbitrary filesystem locations, potentially overwriting critical system files or introducing malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input Validation] Does the code validate that abi_directories paths exist and are actually directories before processing, or can non-existent/file paths cause panics or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Handling] The read_abis() call uses .expect() which will panic on failure - can malformed ABI files cause denial of service during build processes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [YAML Deserialization] When with_aptos_types registry_file is provided, the YAML deserialization using serde_yaml::from_str could be vulnerable to YAML bombs or deserialization attacks - are there size limits or validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an extremely large YAML registry file that causes excessive memory consumption during deserialization, leading to OOM conditions? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-sdk-builder/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Directory Traversal] When install_dir is used by Rust::Installer or Go::Installer, can relative paths escape the intended installation directory? (Medium)",
