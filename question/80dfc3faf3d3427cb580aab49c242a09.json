  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_spec_section()] [Standalone Specs] When specs_inlined is false, specs are in separate section - can this cause navigation confusion if specs reference items not yet defined? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_text()] [Unicode Handling] The character-by-character processing - can unicode normalization issues or combining characters cause incorrect parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: path_to_string()] [Encoding] Uses to_string_lossy() for path conversion - can this cause data loss for paths with non-UTF8 characters? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: image()] [Path Injection] Image paths are directly interpolated into markdown - can relative path traversal in image paths reference files outside the intended directory? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_svg_file()] [Directory Creation] fs::create_dir_all() is called on output path - can this create directories in unintended locations if paths are manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_spec_blocks()] [Tag Extraction] Tag extraction from doc comments uses simple string searching for '[' and ']' - can nested brackets or escape sequences cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_html_table()] [Column Mismatch] The table generation expects specific column names - what happens if the spec block doesn't match the expected format? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: type_display_context_for_fun()] [Type Display] Type display context sets use_module_qualification=true - can this cause excessively long type names in documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: type_parameter_display()] [Generic Display] Type parameter display with ability constraints - can complex generic bounds cause formatting or escaping issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [References File] The references file content is appended to all outputs - can extremely large references files cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Trim Behavior] References file content is trimmed before appending - can this cause issues with preformatted content or significant whitespace? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_function()] [Visibility Logic] Functions are filtered by include_private_fun and is_exposed() - can the visibility logic be incorrect, exposing private implementation details? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: function_header_display()] [Visibility Display] Entry functions and visibility modifiers are displayed - can incorrect visibility strings leak security-sensitive information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: compute_module_infos()] [Info Consistency] Module infos are computed once at start - if module structure changes during generation, can stale infos cause broken references? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: ref_for_module()] [Missing Info] If module info is missing from self.infos, empty string is returned - can this cause broken links in generated documentation? (Low)"
