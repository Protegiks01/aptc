  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/workflow/mod.rs] [Function: ApplyExecutionOutput::run()] [State Ordering Attack] Can an attacker exploit the sequential execution of DoStateCheckpoint::run() followed by DoLedgerUpdate::run() to cause state-ledger inconsistency if the second operation fails but the first succeeds, leading to divergent state roots across validators?
