  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module: aptos_vm_uncoordinated] [Access Control] Should the aptos_vm_uncoordinated module be publicly exposed, or could unrestricted access to benchmark VM execution components allow attackers to bypass production VM safety checks and execute malicious transactions outside the normal consensus flow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module: native_config] [Configuration Security] Is the native_config module's public exposure a security risk, potentially allowing external code to manipulate executor concurrency settings and thread pool configurations, leading to resource exhaustion or consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module: native_transaction] [Transaction Parsing] Does the public exposure of native_transaction allow malicious code to directly parse and potentially forge NativeTransaction types that bypass normal transaction validation, enabling unauthorized state modifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module: native_vm] [VM Execution] Can the publicly exposed native_vm module be exploited to execute transactions through the native executor path instead of the production AptosVM, potentially bypassing gas metering, signature verification, or other critical security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module: parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor] [Execution Isolation] Is the parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor safely isolated from production code, or could its public visibility allow attackers to trigger uncoordinated parallel execution that produces non-deterministic state roots, breaking consensus across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [All Modules] [Benchmark Isolation] Are these benchmark modules properly restricted to test/benchmark contexts only, or could they be invoked in production environments where the native executor's simplified security model (hardcoded gas, no proper validation) would enable fund theft or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [All Modules] [API Surface] Does making all five modules publicly visible create an unnecessarily large attack surface, where internal benchmark functionality should be restricted to crate-private visibility to prevent misuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Security Boundary] Is there a clear security boundary between production execution (AptosVM) and benchmark execution (native modules), or could confusion between the two execution paths lead to deploying benchmark code in production, causing catastrophic security failures? (High)"
