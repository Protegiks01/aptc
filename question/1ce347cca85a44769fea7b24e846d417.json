  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Consensus Safety] Can a Byzantine validator craft a malicious EpochChangeProof that passes verification but contains an invalid validator set, allowing unauthorized validators to participate in consensus and break safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Race Condition] Is there a race condition between shutdown_current_processor() and the state sync operation where messages from the new epoch could be processed before the old epoch components are fully shutdown, causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker cause sync_to_target() to hang indefinitely by providing a valid but unreachable ledger_info, causing permanent consensus halt since the code expects this to succeed? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [State Inconsistency] After shutdown_current_processor() completes but before state sync finishes, can concurrent message processing cause pending_blocks to be populated with blocks from the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Replay Attack] Does the code properly validate that the EpochChangeProof's epoch is strictly greater than self.epoch(), or could an attacker replay an old epoch proof to cause validators to revert to a previous epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Panic DoS] If execution_client.sync_to_target() fails after processor shutdown, the expect() call causes a panic - can this be triggered by network issues to DoS validators during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: initiate_new_epoch()] [Memory Leak] When pending_blocks is cleared with PendingBlocks::new(), are there any Arc references held by other components that could cause memory leaks across epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Validator Set Manipulation] Can a malicious proposer manipulate the ValidatorSet payload to include validators with zero voting power or duplicate addresses, breaking validator verifier assumptions and causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Configuration Injection] If onchain_consensus_config fails to parse and falls back to default(), can this create a consensus split where some validators use on-chain config and others use defaults? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Randomness Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate randomness_override_seq_num in node config to force-disable randomness even when the network has enabled it, breaking randomness-dependent features? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Key Loading Failure] If load_consensus_key() fails and panics, does this create a permanent DoS where the validator cannot participate in new epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Config Desync] When onchain_execution_config uses default_if_missing(), can this cause execution parameter mismatches between validators leading to different block execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [Epoch State Race] Between setting self.epoch_state and calling initialize_shared_component(), can concurrent message processing access inconsistent epoch state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_new_epoch()] [DKG State Manipulation] If the DKGState resource is corrupted or manipulated on-chain, can this cause all validators to fail randomness initialization and break consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: load_consensus_key()] [Key Confusion] When a validator is not in the validator set and loads default_consensus_sk(), can this lead to key reuse across different validator nodes or epochs, breaking safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: load_consensus_key()] [Unauthorized Access] Does consensus_sk_by_pk() properly validate that the loaded key matches the expected public key, or could storage corruption allow loading an incorrect private key? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_round_manager()] [Safety Rules Init] If safety_rules.perform_initialize() returns ValidatorNotInSet error but execution continues, can this validator still sign votes or proposals, violating safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_round_manager()] [Safety Rules Race] Is there a race condition where safety_rules_container is shared between epoch transitions, allowing votes from the old epoch to be signed with new epoch's safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: load_consensus_key()] [Storage Corruption] If key_storage returns a corrupted or tampered private key, is there any validation before the key is used for signing consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [DKG Epoch Mismatch] The check 'dkg_session.metadata.dealer_epoch + 1 != new_epoch_state.epoch' rejects mismatched epochs, but can an attacker cause a one-epoch delay in DKG completion to permanently disable randomness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Secret Share Decryption] If decrypt_secret_share_from_transcript() succeeds but returns an invalid secret share, is there validation before using it for randomness generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Transcript Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate the DKG transcript stored on-chain to cause honest validators to derive invalid randomness keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Key Persistence Race] Between generating augmented_key_pair and saving it to rand_storage, can a crash cause key loss requiring regeneration with different randomness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Fast Randomness Bypass] When fast_randomness_is_enabled checks fail silently, does this create a consensus split where some validators use fast randomness and others don't? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Index Validation] Is my_index validated to be within bounds before using it for secret share decryption, or could an out-of-bounds index cause panics or incorrect key material? (High)"
