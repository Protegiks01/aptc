  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Consensus safety] If signing fails intermittently due to Vault issues, can this cause validators to miss signing deadlines, reducing network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Epoch boundary] Can key rotation during epoch transitions cause validators to sign with mismatched keys, breaking consensus quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Key synchronization] If different validator nodes read different key versions due to Vault replication lag, can this cause signature verification failures fragmenting the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Validator key theft] If an attacker gains temporary access to export validator keys, can they sign malicious blocks even after access is revoked, breaking safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Empty response] If read_ed25519_key() returns an empty vector, does first() return None causing panic or returning misleading KeyNotSet error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key_previous_version()] [Single version] If only one key version exists, does requesting previous version fail gracefully or cause panic attempting to access version 0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: unnamespaced()] [No separator] If key doesn't contain NAMESPACE_SEPARATOR, does unwrap_or(name) correctly return the full name without issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Empty key] Can empty string keys be written to Vault, and if so, do they cause conflicts with root paths or special Vault behaviors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: crypto_name()] [Special characters] Can key names with special characters (/, \\, etc.) after transformation cause Vault path injection or access to unintended transit keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Write acknowledgment] Does write_secret() wait for Vault to persist data to disk, or can power failures cause data loss of validator secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Read consistency] Are reads strongly consistent with writes, or can stale reads return old secret values causing validators to use outdated configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: secret_versions] [In-memory only] Since secret_versions is in-memory, does validator restart cause version tracking loss leading to CAS failures until secrets are re-read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Rotation persistence] If validator crashes between rotate_key() and trim_key_versions(), do old key versions remain accessible indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Backup security] If private keys are exported for backup, how are they protected, and can backup theft compromise all validator security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Recovery process] During key recovery via import, can race conditions cause both old and new keys to be active, allowing double-signing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Irreversible deletion] Does reset_and_clear() provide any safety checks or confirmation before deleting all validator keys, or can accidental calls cause permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Renewal logging] Does token renewal only log on failure, missing successful renewals that could help detect stolen tokens being renewed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Signing metrics] Are signing operations instrumented with metrics to detect unusual patterns like excessive signing or unexpected key usage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Export detection] Are key exports logged with sufficient detail (timestamp, caller, destination) to enable forensic analysis after key theft? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Schema changes] If secret value schemas change across versions, does deserialization handle migrations gracefully or cause validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Key format changes] If Ed25519PublicKey format changes in future Aptos versions, does this break compatibility with keys stored in Vault? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [Client version] Can Client version mismatches with Vault server cause protocol errors or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Regulatory compliance] Does unrestricted private key export violate any key management compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, SOC2) for validator operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: VaultPolicy::set_policies()] [Permission model] Can the Anyone identity in set_policies() accidentally grant public access to validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Caching] Does every get() call hit Vault storage, or is there caching to reduce latency for frequently accessed secrets affecting validator performance? (Low)"
