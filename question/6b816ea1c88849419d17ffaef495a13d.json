  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Verification timing side channel] Does the parallel verification at line 111-118 have consistent timing regardless of success/failure? Can timing differences leak information about validator state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [OptBlockData interaction] [Timestamp ordering attack] OptBlockData requires strictly increasing timestamps (opt_block_data.rs lines 102-106), but can an attacker propose multiple blocks at the same round with subtly different timestamps to cause validator disagreement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator set staleness] The validator parameter at line 100 is used for cryptographic verification - can this become stale during epoch transitions, allowing proposals with signatures from the old validator set to be accepted in the new epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [ProofCache consistency] The proof_cache at line 101 is shared across proposals - can concurrent verification of multiple proposals cause cache inconsistencies or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Quorum store mode inconsistency] The quorum_store_enabled flag at line 102 affects payload verification - what happens if different validators have different quorum_store_enabled settings? Can this cause divergent validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Block storage interaction] After verify_well_formed() passes, is the proposal immediately stored? Can there be a gap where invalid proposals that fail verify() are still partially committed to storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Proposal replay across epochs] While epoch is checked at line 65-66, can an attacker replay an OptProposalMsg from an old epoch with modified epoch values that pass structural validation but break consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Duplicate proposal processing] Can the same OptProposalMsg be sent multiple times, passing verify() each time, causing validators to waste resources on duplicate verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Struct: OptProposalMsg] [PartialEq exploitation] The PartialEq implementation at line 12 enables equality checks - can attackers exploit this to create proposals that are equal but have different cryptographic validity?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature malleability] At line 117, grandparent_qc().verify() performs signature verification - are BLS signatures used, and if so, can signature malleability be exploited to create multiple valid signatures for the same QC? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Aggregated signature attack] Does QC verification at line 117 properly check that the aggregated signature represents distinct validators?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Hash collision in QC ID] At line 70-71, QC IDs are compared for equality - are these cryptographic hashes resistant to collision attacks? Can an attacker find collisions to create conflicting QCs with same ID? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Payload proof verification] The payload verification at line 113-115 includes proof verification using proof_cache - can quantum computing advances break the cryptographic assumptions underlying these proofs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [State sync attack] The grandparent QC must match sync_info's HQC (lines 69-75), but can an attacker exploit state synchronization gaps where different validators have different views of the highest QC? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify()] [Concurrent validation race] Can multiple threads validate the same OptProposalMsg concurrently, and if so, can this cause race conditions in shared state like proof_cache or validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [SyncInfo interaction] [Certificate synchronization gap] SyncInfo contains multiple certificates (HQC, HOC, HCC) - can validators with different certificate sets accept/reject the same proposal inconsistently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_proposal_msg.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Atomic validation] Are the checks in verify_well_formed() atomic with respect to proposal processing? Can proposal state change between validation and use? (High)",
