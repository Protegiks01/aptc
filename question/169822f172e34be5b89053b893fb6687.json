  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [Error masking] Do error conversions to PeerManagerError mask important details that would help identify Byzantine behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All async functions] [Panic safety] Are all async functions panic-safe, or can panics during await points leave the peer manager in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Iterator panic] Can a panicking iterator cause send_to_many() to partially complete, leaving message delivery in undefined state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [Channel shutdown] How are channel shutdown errors handled across all functions, and can they cause cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Async cancellation] If the send_rpc() future is cancelled, is the request properly cleaned up from the peer manager's pending request map? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: dial_peer()] [Future leak] Can dropping the dial_peer() future before completion leak resources or cause connection attempts to continue in the background? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: disconnect_peer()] [Async drop] What happens if the disconnect_peer() future is dropped - is disconnection still guaranteed to complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All async functions] [Executor fairness] Can futures be scheduled unfairly causing some peer operations to be delayed affecting consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [PeerId collision] Can PeerId hash collisions cause messages to be misrouted between different peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [PeerId reuse] Can a disconnected peer's PeerId be reused before cleanup is complete, causing messages to be delivered to the wrong peer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: dial_peer()] [Identity binding] Is PeerId cryptographically bound to the connection, or can an attacker connect with a claimed PeerId that doesn't match their keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [Validator PeerId] Are validator PeerIds distinguished from non-validator PeerIds, and can this distinction be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Message tampering] Between enqueuing and actual network transmission, can messages be tampered with or modified? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Message signing] Does send_to() ensure messages are properly signed before transmission, or is that handled elsewhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response authentication] Is the RPC response cryptographically authenticated to ensure it came from the intended peer? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All send functions] [Replay protection] Can old messages be replayed through send operations to cause confusion in consensus state machines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Broadcast amplification] Can an attacker trigger send_to_many() with a large recipient list to amplify resource consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [RPC flood] Can an attacker flood a validator with RPC requests to exhaust connection resources and cause liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: dial_peer()] [Connection flood] Can rapid dial_peer() calls exhaust operating system resources like file descriptors causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [All functions] [CPU exhaustion] Can message processing overhead be exploited to cause CPU exhaustion affecting validator's ability to participate in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: disconnect_peer()] [Partition creation] Can selective disconnect_peer() calls create network partitions where validators are divided into multiple groups? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Selective broadcast] Can send_to_many() be manipulated to broadcast to only a subset of validators, creating divergent consensus states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Multiple functions] [Asymmetric partition] Can combinations of send/disconnect operations create asymmetric partitions where some validators can reach others but not vice versa? (Critical)",
