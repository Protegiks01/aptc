  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Struct: DeltaDataView] [State inconsistency] Does DeltaDataView.get_state_value() always returning STORAGE_AGGREGATOR_VALUE (100001) mask potential underflow attacks where aggregators could go negative in production, preventing proper testing of delta operation safety bounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: DeltaDataView::get_state_value()] [Missing validation] Can the mock always returning Some(StateValue) hide bugs where production code fails to handle missing aggregator values, potentially causing panics or incorrect state when aggregators don't exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Struct: DeltaDataView] [State view bypass] Does the unreachable!() panic in get_usage() mean tests never validate storage usage limits, allowing transactions to bypass gas-based storage constraints in production code? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Struct: NonEmptyGroupDataView] [Resource group manipulation] Can an attacker exploit that NonEmptyGroupDataView always returns default_group_map() with RESERVED_TAG to bypass deletion validation, as tests never cover the case where groups should actually be empty? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: NonEmptyGroupDataView::get_state_value()] [Delayed field testing gap] Does the delayed_field_testing flag returning mock values for all non-group keys prevent testing of actual delayed field deletion scenarios, potentially hiding critical state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: default_group_map()] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker exploit that the storage version is hardcoded to u32::MAX in tests to bypass version checks in production, potentially causing rollback or replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: NonEmptyGroupDataView::get_state_value()] [Metadata injection] Does hardcoding raw_metadata(5) for all group values prevent testing of metadata-based access control or size limits, potentially hiding DoS attacks via oversized groups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Constant: RESERVED_TAG] [Tag collision] Can an attacker craft transactions that collide with RESERVED_TAG (0) to bypass group validation logic that assumes this tag is never deleted, causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Constant: STORAGE_AGGREGATOR_VALUE] [Overflow vulnerability] Is STORAGE_AGGREGATOR_VALUE (100001) too small to test realistic aggregator scenarios, potentially hiding integer overflow bugs when production aggregators hold large token amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::from_value()] [Size manipulation] Can the resize(16, 1) operation in from_value() mask size-based validation bugs, as all test values become 16 bytes regardless of actual content, hiding length validation exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::with_len_and_metadata()] [Deletion bypass] Does treating len=0 as Deletion prevent testing of zero-length valid values, potentially allowing attackers to cause deletions by crafting zero-length write operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::write_op_kind()] [Write type confusion] Can an attacker manipulate WriteOpKind to mark Creation as Deletion or vice versa, bypassing existence checks if tests don't cover all type transition edge cases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::from_state_value()] [Metadata loss] Does converting None to StateValueMetadata::none() hide bugs where production code relies on preserved metadata, potentially causing state corruption when metadata is critical for access control? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::set_bytes()] [Immutability bypass] Can set_bytes() being called after construction allow tests to bypass immutability checks in production code, hiding race conditions where values are modified after commitment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/types.rs] [Function: ValueType::as_state_value()] [None handling] Does as_state_value() returning None for deletions prevent testing of scenarios where deleted values still need metadata, potentially causing state merkle tree inconsistencies?
