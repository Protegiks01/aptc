  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: get_lowest_version_from_range_set()] [min() comparison] Can the min() operation on Version values overflow or produce unexpected results if malicious peers advertise versions near Version::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: get_lowest_version_from_range_set()] [Iterator invalidation] If the data_ranges slice is being modified concurrently, can the iterator produce undefined behavior or incorrect minimum values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Trait: Display for GlobalDataSummary] [Information disclosure] Does the Display implementation expose sensitive internal state that could be logged or transmitted, allowing attackers to gather intelligence about network topology or data availability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Trait: Display for AdvertisedData] [Denial of service] If highest/lowest calculation methods are expensive and Display is called frequently (e.g., in logging), can this cause performance degradation when formatting large AdvertisedData structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Trait: Debug for AdvertisedData] [Resource exhaustion] The Debug implementation iterates through all synced_ledger_infos and formats detailed information. Can formatting very large vectors cause memory exhaustion or CPU spikes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: fmt() for AdvertisedData::Debug] [LedgerInfoWithSignatures::V0 pattern match] Does the pattern match assume V0 is the only variant? Can future variants cause match errors or incomplete formatting, potentially hiding information needed for debugging security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Function: fmt() for AdvertisedData::Debug] [ends_epoch detection] The logic checks next_epoch_state().is_some() to determine if an epoch ends. Can malicious ledger infos craft next_epoch_state to give false positives/negatives, misleading debugging efforts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: GlobalDataSummary] [Concurrent access] If GlobalDataSummary is shared across threads without proper synchronization (Arc/Mutex), can race conditions cause torn reads where advertised_data and optimal_chunk_sizes are from different snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: AdvertisedData] [Data coherence] Can advertised data become internally inconsistent (e.g., synced_ledger_infos claiming version 1000 but transactions only up to version 500) due to lack of invariant enforcement, causing synchronization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Module: global_summary] [Missing validation] The module lacks input validation on CompleteDataRange values. Can malicious ranges with inverted bounds (highest < lowest) be inserted and cause undefined behavior in range checking logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Module: global_summary] [No access control] There are no restrictions on who can create or modify GlobalDataSummary instances. Can untrusted network peers directly construct malicious summaries that bypass validation in other modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Import: CompleteDataRange] [Type safety] Does CompleteDataRange<T> provide sufficient type safety to prevent version/epoch confusion, or can attackers exploit generic type parameters to create semantically invalid ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Import: LedgerInfoWithSignatures] [Variant exhaustiveness] Does the code handle all variants of LedgerInfoWithSignatures correctly, or can future variants break assumptions in Debug formatting and highest_synced_ledger_info()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Type: Epoch] [Epoch arithmetic] If Epoch is a wrapper type around u64, can epoch arithmetic in aggregation logic overflow when computing highest epoch, wrapping to 0 and causing severe consensus issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Type: Version] [Version arithmetic] Can Version overflow in range iteration or comparison operations, causing synchronization to skip versions or accept invalid version sequences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Usage: Data client integration] Can malicious peers flood the data client with frequent GlobalDataSummary updates, causing excessive cloning, comparison, and processing overhead that degrades node performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Usage: Aggregation logic] When aggregating AdvertisedData from multiple peers, does the aggregation logic properly deduplicate ranges or can it grow unbounded, causing memory exhaustion over time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Usage: Peer selection] If highest_synced_ledger_info() is used to select which peer to sync from, can attackers advertise the highest version but fail to deliver data, causing synchronization to stall on malicious peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Usage: Chunk size optimization] Does the code validate that optimal_chunk_sizes are within reasonable bounds before using them, or can extreme values cause buffer allocation failures or inefficient network usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Usage: Range validation] Before requesting data based on advertised ranges, is there cryptographic verification that the advertising peer actually possesses the data, or can peers lie about availability? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Boundary: Epoch transitions] Can malicious nodes advertise epoch_ending_ledger_infos with incorrect epoch boundaries, causing nodes to request epoch-ending ledger infos for epochs that don't actually end, breaking reconfiguration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Boundary: Genesis handling] Does the code properly handle version 0 and epoch 0 as valid starting points, or can these be confused with uninitialized values causing bootstrap failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Boundary: Version::MAX] Can nodes handle AdvertisedData claiming data exists at Version::MAX without overflow in range calculations or iteration logic? (High)",
