  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Enum: MVDelayedFieldsError::DeltaApplicationFailure] [Limit manipulation] Can attackers craft delta sequences that stay just below aggregator limits during speculative execution but violate limits when finalized, bypassing the limit checks meant to prevent overflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Enum: MVDataError::Unresolved with DeltaOp] [Delta chain explosion] Can an attacker create exponentially growing chains of Unresolved(DeltaOp) dependencies where each transaction adds more deltas, causing resolution to require exponential time and halting execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Function: from_panic_or()] [Aggregator error obfuscation] Can the from_panic_or conversion hide critical aggregator errors by mapping multiple distinct DelayedFieldsSpeculativeError variants to the same MVDelayedFieldsError::DeltaApplicationFailure, losing debugging information needed to identify attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Type: AtomicTxnIndex] [Compare-and-swap races] If AtomicTxnIndex is used in compare-and-swap operations for transaction scheduling, can ABA problems occur where an index is reused after wrapping, causing CAS to succeed when it should fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Struct: ShiftedTxnIndex with PartialOrd] [Ordering inconsistency] Can the PartialOrd implementation for ShiftedTxnIndex produce inconsistent orderings when accessed from different threads, causing transactions to be sorted differently across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Function: extract_value_no_layout()] [Panic recovery] When extract_value_no_layout() panics due to unexpected layout presence, can the panic be caught at a higher level leaving the multi-version data structure in an inconsistent state with partial writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Type: Version] [Version comparison edge case] When comparing Version values, can (TxnIndex::MAX, Incarnation::MAX) be incorrectly compared with StorageVersion, causing the latest transaction to be ordered before storage state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/types.rs] [Enum: ValueWithLayout] [Mixed variant access] Can code that expects consistent ValueWithLayout variants across a transaction's writes encounter mixed RawFromStorage and Exchanged values, causing incorrect assumptions about layout availability? (Medium)"
