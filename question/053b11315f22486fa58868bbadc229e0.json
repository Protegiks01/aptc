  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Epoch: Reconfiguration] [Config consistency check] Does epoch reconfiguration verify that all ValidatorInfo entries are internally consistent (matching indices, valid keys, positive voting power) before committing the new validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Epoch: Pending validators] [Pending to active race] When ValidatorInfo moves from pending_active to active_validators list, can race conditions cause the same validator to appear in both lists temporarily, double-counting their voting power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Arithmetic: Voting power sum] [Sum overflow] When summing consensus_voting_power across all ValidatorInfo entries to compute total voting power, can overflow of u128 accumulator cause modular wraparound that invalidates quorum calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Arithmetic: Quorum threshold] [Rounding errors] When computing quorum as total_voting_power * 2 / 3 + 1, can integer division rounding cause the threshold to be set too low, allowing <67% of validators to achieve quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Arithmetic: Validator index] [Index out of bounds] Can ValidatorConfig.validator_index exceed the actual size of the validator vector, causing out-of-bounds access when looking up ValidatorInfo by index? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Compatibility: Schema evolution] [New field addition] If future protocol versions add new fields to ValidatorInfo, can old validators deserialize new ValidatorInfo with default values that break consensus assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Compatibility: Field removal] [Deprecated field handling] If obsolete fields are removed from ValidatorInfo in protocol upgrades, can old validators still participating in consensus crash when deserializing the new structure? (High)"
