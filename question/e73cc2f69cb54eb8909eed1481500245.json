  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Monitoring blind spot] If counter increments fail or are delayed, can successful attacks go undetected because metrics don't reflect actual upload activity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Metric race condition] Are the counter operations atomic, or can race conditions cause incorrect counts that hide the true scale of upload failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Malicious NFT metadata injection] Can an attacker craft malicious JSON metadata containing XSS payloads, phishing URLs, or misleading information that gets stored and served to users viewing NFT marketplaces?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Image bomb DoS] Can an attacker upload specially crafted image bombs (decompression bombs) that when processed by downstream systems cause memory exhaustion or crashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Bandwidth exhaustion] Can repeated uploads of large images exhaust network bandwidth between the crawler and GCS, degrading service for legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_json_to_gcs()] [Hardcoded timeout vulnerability] Is the MAX_RETRY_TIME_SECONDS constant of 2 seconds too aggressive for production use, causing legitimate large uploads to fail and resulting in incomplete NFT metadata indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Backoff configuration attack] If the ExponentialBackoff defaults are not optimal, can this be exploited to cause either too many retries (resource exhaustion) or too few retries (data loss)?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/gcs.rs] [Function: write_image_to_gcs()] [Success confirmation bypass] Can the function return Ok(filename) even if the upload was only partially successful, hiding data corruption from callers? (Medium)",
