  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [IP Spoofing] Can an attacker spoof their source_ip in CheckerData by manipulating X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-IP headers to match IPs in the allowlist? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack] If the allowlist contains IPv4 ranges but the attacker connects via IPv6 (or vice versa), can they bypass checks through protocol confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [CIDR Range Overlap] If the allowlist file contains overlapping CIDR ranges, does the bypasser handle this correctly, or can ambiguous ranges lead to unintended bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [Localhost Bypass] Does the IpAllowlistBypasser properly handle special IPs like 127.0.0.1, ::1, or 0.0.0.0 that could allow local attackers to bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Integration: IpAllowlistBypasser] [Private IP Ranges] Can an attacker from within a private network (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) exploit overly permissive allowlist ranges to gain unauthorized bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Data Integrity] Does request_can_bypass() validate that CheckerData.time_request_received_secs is within acceptable bounds, or can an attacker replay old bypass requests with manipulated timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Receiver Validation] Does the bypasser check that CheckerData.receiver is a valid AccountAddress, or can an attacker use malformed addresses to cause panics or bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Header Map Cloning] Since CheckerData.headers uses Arc<HeaderMap>, can concurrent modifications to the original HeaderMap affect bypass decisions for in-flight requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Source IP Validation] Does the bypasser validate that CheckerData.source_ip is a valid routable IP, or can attackers use unspecified (0.0.0.0/::) or broadcast addresses to exploit edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Data Clone Safety] Since request_can_bypass() receives a cloned CheckerData, can memory exhaustion occur if an attacker triggers many concurrent bypass checks with large header maps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Unlimited Funds] If bypasser returns true, the requester gets maximum_amount_with_bypass which could be much higher - can an attacker with bypass access drain the entire faucet treasury? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Rate Limit Bypass] Does a successful bypass skip ALL rate limiting checkers including MemoryRatelimit and RedisRatelimit, allowing attackers to make unlimited concurrent requests? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Checker Skip] Since bypass skips all checkers including IpBlocklist and CaptchaChecker, can malicious IPs that should be blocked exploit bypass tokens/IPs to access funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Storage Bypass] Does bypassing skip storage operations that track fund usage, allowing an attacker to repeatedly fund the same address without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Completion Callback] Since bypass skips the Checker completion step, can this lead to inconsistent state where funded requests aren't marked as complete in storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Panic Handling] If the underlying ListManager or IpRangeManager panics during contains() checks, does this crash the entire faucet service or is it handled gracefully? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [File Read Errors] If the allowlist file is corrupted or contains invalid UTF-8, does build() fail gracefully or can it lead to undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Empty Config] If ListManagerConfig or IpRangeManagerConfig points to an empty file, does this create a bypasser that allows nothing or everything? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Timeout Handling] If request_can_bypass() takes too long (e.g., file I/O delays), can this cause request timeouts that are interpreted as bypass failures or successes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: BypasserConfig] [Deserialization Errors] Can malformed YAML/JSON config trigger deserialization errors that cause the faucet to fail open (allow all bypasses) instead of fail closed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Async Safety] Since request_can_bypass() is async and multiple bypassers can be checked concurrently, are there race conditions in the underlying ListManager/IpRangeManager HashSet/IpRange data structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Send + Sync Bounds] The BypasserTrait requires Sync + Send + 'static, but do the underlying AuthTokenBypasser and IpAllowlistBypasser actually guarantee thread-safe access to their managers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Function: BypasserConfig::build()] [Config Reload Race] If the faucet supports hot-reloading of bypasser configs, can concurrent build() calls create race conditions where old and new bypassers coexist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Enum: Bypasser] [Shared State] If multiple Bypasser instances share references to the same ListManager or IpRangeManager, can concurrent modifications lead to data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/mod.rs] [Trait: BypasserTrait] [Lock Contention] If the underlying managers use locks for thread safety, can an attacker trigger lock contention by making many concurrent bypass requests, causing DoS? (Medium)"
