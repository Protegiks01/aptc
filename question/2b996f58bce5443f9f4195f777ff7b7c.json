  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Cursor Size DoS] Is there any limit on cursor string length, or can an API server provide extremely large cursor values (e.g., gigabytes) causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Cursor Format Validation] Does the code validate cursor format, or can arbitrary strings be accepted that break pagination logic or cause parser errors downstream? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Duplicate Headers] Does the code handle duplicate headers correctly (e.g., multiple X-Aptos-Chain-Id headers), or will only the first/last be used, enabling header confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Header Whitespace] Are leading/trailing whitespaces in header values properly trimmed before parsing, or can '  42  ' bypass validation that expects '42'? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Partial Parsing Attack] Can an attacker provide headers that parse successfully for some fields but not others, causing the error path to leak information about valid/invalid values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Error Message Information Leak] Does the error message at lines 87-98 leak sensitive information about expected state values that could help an attacker craft valid-looking fake state? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Cross-Field Validation] Is there validation for relationships between fields (epoch/version, timestamp/version, block_height/version), or can inconsistent state be created? (High)",
