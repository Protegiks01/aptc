  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample_duration()] [System call cost] Each sample_duration() call invokes SystemTime::now() which is a system call - could this cause performance issues or timing attacks if called extremely frequently in validator hot paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Macro: sample!] [Type inference] Could ambiguous type inference in the macro expansion cause compilation errors or unexpected behavior when $($args)+ involves complex generic types used in validator code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Struct: Sampling] [Drop implementation] Does Sampling need a custom Drop implementation to clean up resources, or could static Sampling instances created by the macro leak resources over the validator's lifetime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample_frequency()] [Memory consistency] Even with SeqCst ordering, could there be memory consistency issues on non-x86 architectures where the count value seen by different threads is inconsistent, causing unpredictable sampling behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample_duration()] [Closure capture] Does the closure at line 72-77 properly capture the rate and now variables, or could there be lifetime issues if these are moved while fetch_update is retrying? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Macro: sample!] [Attribute propagation] Do attributes like #[inline] or #[cold] properly propagate through the macro expansion, or could incorrect optimization hints cause the sampled code to be optimized inappropriately? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample()] [Method visibility] Is the sample() method properly encapsulated, or could external code directly manipulate the Sampling state to bypass sampling controls and cause log flooding or suppression? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Enum: SampleRate] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] Is the match in sample() at line 41-45 exhaustive, and if new SampleRate variants are added in the future, could missing patterns cause compilation errors or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample_frequency()] [Underflow protection] The saturating_sub operations at lines 52 and 54 prevent underflow - but could there be logic errors where the counter gets stuck at 0 or rate-1, causing sampling to occur too frequently or not at all? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Function: sample_duration()] [Duration calculation] The calculation at line 73 uses saturating_sub on seconds - could this hide legitimate time-going-backwards scenarios that should be detected and logged as security events in validator operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/sample.rs] [Macro: sample!] [Scoping issues] Could the static SAMPLING variable interfere with other static variables or cause initialization order issues in complex validator module dependency graphs? (Low)"
