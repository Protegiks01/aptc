(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Data Integrity] Does the serialize() method properly handle the optional payload and state_checkpoint_hash fields, or can None values lead to inconsistent BigQuery schemas where some transactions have missing fields that break analytics queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft Transaction objects with extremely large string fields (hash, payload, vm_status) that cause excessive memory allocation during serialization, leading to OOM conditions in BigQuery streaming services?

  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Field Count Manipulation] In lines 12-18, the len variable is calculated based on optional fields - can race conditions or concurrent modifications during serialization cause len to be incorrect, leading to incomplete serialization and corrupted BigQuery records? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Field Validation] Does the deserialization logic validate that version, block_height, and epoch values are non-negative, or can negative values be injected that break assumptions in downstream transaction processing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Duplicate Field Attack] Lines 178-286 check for duplicate fields and return errors, but can an attacker bypass these checks by providing both camelCase and snake_case variants of the same field (e.g., 'blockHeight' and 'block_height') to cause inconsistent state or crash the deserializer?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Success Flag Tampering] The success boolean field is deserialized without validation - can an attacker flip this flag to mark failed transactions as successful in BigQuery, corrupting analytics data and hiding transaction failures that should be investigated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [VM Status Injection] The vm_status field is deserialized as an arbitrary string - can an attacker inject malicious or malformed VM status codes that don't match the actual execution result, causing mismatches between BigQuery data and on-chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Missing Field Exploitation] Lines 289-306 use ok_or_else to validate required fields, but the error messages only indicate which field is missing - can an attacker exploit missing field errors to probe the deserialization system and identify which fields are required vs optional?
