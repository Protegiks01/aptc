  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic/Crash] Can the unwrap() call on line 22 cause the entire test binary to panic if run_and_report_unit_tests returns an error, potentially allowing an attacker to craft malicious Move test code that crashes the test runner and prevents security audits from completing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error suppression] Does the unwrap() on line 22 properly surface underlying errors from test execution, or does it silently panic and hide critical error information that could indicate malicious test behavior or Move VM vulnerabilities?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File system manipulation] During test plan building, can an attacker exploit race conditions where Move source files are modified between parsing and execution, allowing injection of malicious code that wasn't present during initial validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-unit-test/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Arbitrary code execution] When run_and_report_unit_tests is called on line 13, can malicious Move test code exploit Move VM vulnerabilities to escape the VM sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host system?
