  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Display: fmt] [Information leakage] Does the Display implementation only show account_address.short_str_lossless(), or can verbose logging expose sensitive validator configuration details (keys, network addresses) to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Display: fmt] [Log injection] Can malicious account_address values containing control characters inject fake log entries when ValidatorInfo is formatted, potentially hiding malicious activity in validator logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Testing: Arbitrary] [Fuzzing coverage] Does the proptest Arbitrary derivation generate edge cases like u64::MAX voting power, zero voting power, duplicate addresses, and invalid BLS keys to test validator set robustness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Testing: Arbitrary] [Invalid key generation] Can fuzzing generate ValidatorInfo with consensus_public_key values that are cryptographically invalid but pass serialization, exposing signature verification vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Consensus: Block proposals] [Proposer impersonation] Can a Byzantine node create a ValidatorInfo with stolen account_address and consensus_public_key to impersonate the legitimate block proposer and inject malicious blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Consensus: Vote validation] [Vote weight manipulation] If a validator's ValidatorInfo.consensus_voting_power is updated mid-epoch via staking transactions, can they cast multiple votes with different weights to exceed quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Consensus: Signature verification] [Aggregated signature malleability] When multiple ValidatorInfo entries' consensus_public_keys are aggregated for multi-signature verification, can key aggregation malleability allow signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Consensus: Equivocation detection] [Double-signing with key rotation] If a validator rotates their consensus_public_key in ValidatorConfig, can they sign conflicting blocks with old and new keys without being detected for equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Consensus: Liveness] [Validator exclusion attack] Can an attacker flood the network with invalid ValidatorInfo entries during epoch reconfiguration to cause legitimate validators to be excluded, halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Staking: Voting power updates] [Stale voting power] When stake amounts change in Move's stake.move contract, is ValidatorInfo.consensus_voting_power updated atomically, or can stale values allow validators with reduced stake to vote with old higher power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Staking: Validator registration] [Registration front-running] Can an attacker monitor pending validator registrations and register a ValidatorInfo with the same account_address first to prevent legitimate validators from joining? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Staking: Reward distribution] [Reward calculation inconsistency] If ValidatorInfo voting power and actual staked amount diverge due to desynchronization, can validators receive incorrect rewards leading to economic imbalance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Staking: Slashing] [Slashing bypass] If a validator is slashed in the staking contract but their ValidatorInfo.consensus_voting_power isn't reduced immediately, can they continue voting with full power despite misbehavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Staking: Delegation] [Delegation power confusion] When stake is delegated to a validator, does ValidatorInfo.consensus_voting_power correctly reflect both self-stake and delegated stake, or can accounting errors inflate/deflate voting power? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Network: Peer discovery] [Network address spoofing] Can a malicious node register ValidatorInfo with network addresses pointing to attacker-controlled servers, causing honest validators to connect to fake peers and receive corrupted consensus messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Network: Connection authentication] [Identity mismatch] When validators connect using network addresses from ValidatorInfo.config, is the connection authenticated against consensus_public_key to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Network: Address rotation] [Connection disruption] If a validator updates their network addresses in ValidatorConfig mid-epoch, can this cause other validators to lose connections and fail to achieve quorum for block proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Network: Fullnode addresses] [Fullnode impersonation] Can malicious actors register as validators with fullnode_network_addresses pointing to fake nodes that serve incorrect state data to light clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Move: Struct mapping] [Field mapping errors] Is the Rust ValidatorInfo struct field layout identical to the Move ValidatorInfo in stake.move, or can field ordering/packing differences cause deserialization to map fields incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Move: Type safety] [Type confusion] Can Move transactions create ValidatorInfo resources with type-confused fields (e.g., u64 address instead of AccountAddress) that pass Move VM checks but corrupt Rust deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Move: Resource ownership] [Double-registration] Does Move's stake.move prevent multiple ValidatorInfo resources from being created for the same account_address, or can resource duplication allow voting power multiplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Move: Governance updates] [Unauthorized config changes] Can governance proposals bypass proper checks to modify ValidatorInfo entries directly in global storage, allowing attackers to change validator keys/power without staking requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Epoch: Reconfiguration] [Partial epoch transition] During epoch reconfiguration, if some validators successfully update their ValidatorInfo while others fail, can the network split with different validators operating in different epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Epoch: Reconfiguration] [Validator set size change] When transitioning epochs, can abrupt changes in the number of ValidatorInfo entries (e.g., from 100 to 10 validators) cause consensus parameters like quorum threshold to become invalid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_info.rs] [Epoch: Reconfiguration] [Key rotation timing] If multiple validators rotate their consensus_public_key simultaneously during epoch transition, can this cause signature verification to fail for blocks signed during the transition window? (High)"
