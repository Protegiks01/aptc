  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-in-memory-cache-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: spawn_cache_consumption_task()] [CPU exhaustion] Can the tight polling loop with empty `get_transactions()` results cause 100% CPU usage without yielding, starving other tasks in the tokio runtime?
