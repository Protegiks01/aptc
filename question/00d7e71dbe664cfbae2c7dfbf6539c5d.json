  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] Can back_pressure_total_txn_limit or back_pressure_total_proof_limit be set to u64::MAX during initialization, causing integer overflow in subsequent comparisons in qs_back_pressure() that could disable back pressure protection entirely? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Manipulation] Can a malicious validator propose consensus configuration changes that set back_pressure_total_txn_limit=0 or back_pressure_total_proof_limit=0, causing all transactions to trigger back pressure and halt block production? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Flag Bypass] If allow_batches_without_pos_in_proposal is set to true but enable_payload_v2 is false, can this inconsistent configuration lead to payload construction that violates consensus rules or allows invalid blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch Transition Attack] During epoch transitions when ProofManager is recreated, can batches or proofs from the old epoch be reused if batch_expiry_gap_when_init_usecs is set too high, allowing stale or invalid transactions to be included in new blocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_proofs()] [Proof Flooding] Can a Byzantine validator flood the system with thousands of valid but useless ProofOfStore objects, causing unbounded memory growth in batch_proof_queue since there's no rate limiting before insert_proof()? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_proofs()] [Duplicate Proof Attack] Does insert_proof() properly deduplicate proofs, or can sending the same ProofOfStore multiple times inflate remaining_total_proof_num and trigger false back pressure? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_proofs()] [Proof Validation Bypass] Is there any validation of the ProofOfStore signatures or quorum certificates before calling insert_proof(), or does this function blindly trust all incoming proofs allowing malicious data insertion? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_proofs()] [State Corruption] If insert_proof() fails or panics for some proofs in the Vec, are the remaining proofs processed, or does this create inconsistent state where some proofs are inserted and others silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_proofs()] [Race Condition] Since receive_proofs() is called from an async context, can concurrent calls to receive_proofs() and handle_commit_notification() cause race conditions where committed batches are re-inserted into the queue? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: update_remaining_txns_and_proofs()] [Sampling Attack] The sample! macro with 200ms duration means state updates happen at most every 200ms - can attackers exploit this delay window to inject proofs that won't be counted for back pressure until the next sample? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: update_remaining_txns_and_proofs()] [Integer Overflow] If remaining_txns_and_proofs() returns values near u64::MAX, can the assignment to self.remaining_total_txn_num overflow or wrap around, causing back pressure checks to fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: update_remaining_txns_and_proofs()] [Stale State] Since updates are sampled, can the 200ms delay between updates allow validators to make decisions on stale back pressure data, potentially accepting more transactions than limits allow? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_batches()] [Batch Flooding] Can malicious validators send unlimited batches without proofs to exhaust memory, since there's no validation or rate limiting before calling insert_batches()? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_batches()] [Transaction Duplication] If batch_summaries contains duplicate BatchInfoExt entries or overlapping TxnSummaryWithExpiration, does insert_batches() deduplicate properly or can this inflate transaction counts and cause incorrect back pressure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_batches()] [Malformed Batch Attack] Is there validation that Vec<TxnSummaryWithExpiration> matches the batch digest/size claimed in BatchInfoExt, or can attackers send mismatched data to corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: receive_batches()] [Expiration Bypass] Can batches with expiration timestamps far in the future be inserted, avoiding cleanup and accumulating indefinitely in memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can a malicious proposer set block_timestamp to u64::MAX when constructing blocks, causing handle_updated_block_timestamp() to mark all batches as expired and halt transaction processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Timestamp Rollback Attack] If block_timestamp decreases between consecutive blocks (clock skew or Byzantine proposer), can this cause batches to become unexpired after being marked expired, leading to double-inclusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Incomplete Commit] If mark_committed() fails or panics partway through the batches Vec, are some batches marked committed while others aren't, causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Batch Not Found] What happens if the batches Vec contains BatchInfoExt that were never inserted into batch_proof_queue - does mark_committed() silently ignore them, or can this indicate a serious synchronization bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent handle_commit_notification() and handle_proposal_request() calls cause a race where a batch is committed while simultaneously being pulled for a new proposal? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_commit_notification()] [Memory Leak] If batches are committed but never cleaned up from batch_proof_queue due to bugs in handle_updated_block_timestamp(), does this cause unbounded memory growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_proposal_request()] [Filter Bypass] Lines 106-112 extract excluded_batches from PayloadFilter::InQuorumStore - can a malicious proposer omit batches from this filter to cause double-inclusion of the same batch in multiple blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_proposal_request()] [Unreachable Panic] Line 109 has unreachable!() for PayloadFilter::DirectMempool - if this code path is ever triggered by a configuration bug or attack, will it crash the validator and halt consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Function: handle_proposal_request()] [Transaction Limit Bypass] Lines 114-122 pull proofs with max_txns, max_txns_after_filtering, soft_max_txns_after_filtering - can integer overflow or underflow in these parameters allow pulling unlimited transactions? (Critical)"
