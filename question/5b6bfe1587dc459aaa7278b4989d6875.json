  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Integration] [Connection limits] Are there per-peer or global connection limits enforced, or can attackers open unlimited connections causing resource exhaustion? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Protocol] [TCP Fast Open] Is TCP Fast Open supported, and if so, does it introduce replay attack vulnerabilities in the initial connection establishment? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Protocol] [Connection reset handling] How are unexpected TCP RST packets handled - do they cause immediate disconnection or is there retry logic that could be exploited? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Memory] [String allocation] In connect_via_proxy(), does the format!() call at line 271 properly bound memory allocation, or can extremely long host/port values cause OOM? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Error handling] [Error context loss] Are errors properly wrapped with context throughout the call chain, or can important diagnostic information be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Error handling] [Panic on unwrap] Are there any hidden unwrap() or expect() calls that could cause validator panics with malicious input? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] Can socket operations fail silently (e.g., buffer size setting returning Ok but not actually applying the setting), causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [DNS] [DNSSEC validation] Is DNSSEC validation performed for DNS lookups, or can attackers perform DNS spoofing to redirect validators to malicious nodes? (Critical)",
