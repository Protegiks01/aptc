(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker exploit tls_cert_path or tls_key_path by providing paths like '../../../../etc/passwd' to read arbitrary files from the validator filesystem, potentially exposing private keys or validator credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Certificate validation bypass] Does the TLS configuration at lines 43-46 validate that the certificate and private key match, or can an attacker provide mismatched cert/key pairs causing TLS handshake failures and validator API unavailability?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Weak TLS configuration] Does warp's tls() method at line 44 enforce strong cipher suites and TLS 1.3, or can downgrade attacks force validators to use weak ciphers enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on validator communication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Certificate expiration] Is there validation that TLS certificates are not expired before starting the server, or can expired certificates cause runtime failures after node startup leading to validator API unavailability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Missing certificate revocation checks] Does the TLS setup verify certificate revocation lists (CRL) or OCSP, or can compromised certificates continue to be accepted allowing unauthorized access to validator APIs?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-warp-webserver/src/webserver.rs] [Function: serve()] [Unvalidated routes] The generic Filter parameter at line 37 accepts any routes without validation - can an attacker inject routes that bypass authentication, expose internal APIs, or serve malicious content?
