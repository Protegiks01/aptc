  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/execution_config.rs] [Enum: OnChainExecutionConfig] [Version migration vulnerability] Can an attacker exploit the ordering of enum variants (V1-V7 with Missing in between) to cause deserialization confusion when upgrading from older versions, potentially leading to incorrect execution config being applied? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/execution_config.rs] [Enum: OnChainExecutionConfig] [Backwards compatibility bypass] Does the Missing variant at line 18 create a vulnerability where attackers can force the system to revert to pre-config behavior by manipulating on-chain state, bypassing newer security features like gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/execution_config.rs] [Function: transaction_shuffler_type()] [State inconsistency] Can validators running different software versions interpret the same OnChainExecutionConfig differently due to missing exhaustive matching, causing network partition when processing transaction order?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/execution_config.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_config()] [Memory exhaustion] Does the double BCS deserialization at lines 170-171 allow an attacker to provide nested vectors that expand exponentially, causing memory exhaustion during config loading?
