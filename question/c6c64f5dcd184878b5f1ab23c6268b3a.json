  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [From Implementations] [Error Bubbling] When errors bubble up from network layer through application layer to consensus, can error context be lost at each conversion layer, making root cause analysis impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Cross-component Errors] Can errors originating in one component (e.g., storage) be misclassified as NetworkError or RpcError when passed through application layer, confusing error handling logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Injection] Can test frameworks properly inject Error conditions to test Byzantine fault tolerance, or does the simple error structure make it difficult to simulate specific attack scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Serialization Format] [Fuzzing Surface] Can fuzzers explore the Error deserialization attack surface effectively, or does the simple enum structure limit fuzzing coverage of error handling code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Line 18-22] [anyhow Integration] When anyhow::Error is converted to Error::UnexpectedError, can error context chains in anyhow be exploited to cause stack overflows during error display or logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [Line 20] [to_string() Safety] Is anyhow::Error::to_string() safe to call on all error types, or can custom error types with malicious Display implementations cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/application/error.rs] [From anyhow] [Error Type Erasure] Does converting anyhow::Error (which may contain downcasting information) to String erase type information needed for special handling of specific error conditions in consensus? (Medium)"
