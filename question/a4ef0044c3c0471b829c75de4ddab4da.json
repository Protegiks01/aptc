  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Information Disclosure] Do error messages from std::fs::write() leak sensitive filesystem paths, validator directory structure, or permission information that could help attackers map the validator node's security posture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Information Disclosure] If write() fails due to permission errors, does the error propagation reveal whether certain critical validator files exist at specific paths, aiding reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Error Handling] Does write() properly handle and propagate I/O errors, or could silent failures cause monitoring systems to miss critical validator health issues leading to consensus degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Error Handling] What happens if std::fs::write() returns an error after partial write - is there cleanup logic to remove incomplete files that could confuse monitoring dashboards? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Information Disclosure] When output_path is None and output goes to stdout via println!(), can this leak sensitive validator metrics if the node-checker is run in containers where stdout is logged to centralized systems accessible by attackers?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can extremely large output strings to stdout cause buffer overflows or excessive memory allocation in logging pipelines, affecting validator observability? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Struct: OutputFormat] [Format Confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the format field to cause JSON/YAML serialization vulnerabilities when the output is parsed by monitoring systems, potentially injecting malicious code into dashboards or alerts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Struct: OutputFormat] [Format Confusion] Are there differences in how sensitive data is serialized between JSON and YAML formats that could cause information leakage in one format but not the other? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Struct: OutputFormat] [Format Confusion] If the format is determined by user input (via clap), can an attacker force YAML output even when JSON is expected, breaking monitoring system parsers and causing missed alerts on validator failures?
