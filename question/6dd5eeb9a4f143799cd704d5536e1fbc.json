(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 6-402] [File Inclusion] Are the included JSON transaction files validated at compile time, or could a compromised build environment inject malformed JSON that causes panics or memory corruption when parsed by the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Macro: include_bytes!] [Symlink Attack] Can symbolic links in the json_transactions directory redirect include_bytes! to load files from outside the intended directory tree, allowing injection of arbitrary transaction data during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 6-614] [Build Integrity] Is there any verification that the included JSON files match expected cryptographic hashes or signatures, or could an attacker with build environment access inject malicious test transactions that expose vulnerabilities in indexer parsing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Constant Declarations] [Race Condition] Could concurrent builds or parallel compilation tasks create race conditions where multiple threads attempt to read the same JSON files via include_bytes!, potentially leading to corrupted constant initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 403-495] [Array Construction] Do the aggregated arrays ALL_IMPORTED_MAINNET_TXNS, ALL_IMPORTED_TESTNET_TXNS, etc., have bounds checking, or could indexing beyond array bounds cause memory safety violations in test harness code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Static Constants] [Memory Layout] Are the static byte array constants properly aligned in memory, or could misaligned access patterns cause undefined behavior on certain architectures when the indexer parses these transaction bytes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 6-402] [Buffer Overflow] Could any of the included JSON files exceed expected size limits, causing stack or heap overflow when loaded into memory, especially if the test harness doesn't validate transaction size before processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Constant References] [Use After Free] If test code creates mutable references to slices of these static byte arrays and modifies them unsafely, could this lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities despite Rust's safety guarantees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 403-600] [Memory Exhaustion] Do the aggregated transaction arrays have reasonable size limits, or could an attacker add thousands of transaction constants to cause excessive binary size and memory consumption during test execution? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Imported Transactions] [Replay Attacks] Are the imported mainnet/testnet transactions sanitized to remove sensitive data like private keys or authentication tokens, or could test execution inadvertently leak real-world credentials?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Test Data] [State Consistency] If these test transactions contain invalid state transitions or malformed data that passed through on mainnet due to bugs, could they cause the indexer test suite to accept incorrect behavior as expected?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 403-495] [Test Coverage] Are all critical transaction types and edge cases represented in the imported transaction sets, or could missing test cases allow vulnerabilities in the indexer to go undetected during testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Function: get_transaction_name()] [Lines 654-665] [Incomplete Matching] The pattern match only handles SCRIPTED_TRANSACTIONS constants and returns None for all imported mainnet/testnet/devnet transactions - could this incomplete coverage cause test failures or misidentification of transactions in debugging scenarios?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Function: get_transaction_name()] [Performance] Is the linear pattern matching approach efficient for large numbers of transactions, or could it create performance bottlenecks in test execution when processing hundreds of test cases?
