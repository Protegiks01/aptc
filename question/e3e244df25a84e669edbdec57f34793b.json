  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Clone for Batch] [Payload sharing] When Batch is cloned, is BatchPayload properly deep-copied, or can multiple Batch instances reference the same transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Clone for BatchRequest] [Request duplication] Can cloned BatchRequest instances be used to request the same batch multiple times, causing resource exhaustion on validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Clone for BatchResponse] [Response reuse] Can cloned BatchResponse instances be reused for different requests, causing validators to accept stale or manipulated batch data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Clone for BatchMsg] [Message duplication] Can BatchMsg clones be sent multiple times to bypass rate limiting or max_num_batches restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Impl: Display for BatchRequest] [Information leak] Does the Display implementation expose sensitive information (like complete digest values) that could aid attackers in crafting forged requests? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Test: test_batch_payload_padding] [Incomplete coverage] Does the test only verify empty batch padding, missing edge cases like maximum-size batches, overflow conditions, or malformed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Test: test_batch_payload_padding] [Magic constant] The assertion uses hardcoded BATCH_PADDING_BYTES - can attackers exploit differences between test and production padding calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::verify() num_bytes check] [Compression attack] Can an attacker provide highly compressible transactions that report small num_bytes but expand during processing, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::new() with BatchPayload] [Size underflow] Can payload.num_bytes() underflow if transactions have negative or invalid sizes, bypassing size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: PersistedValue::batch_info()] [Info tampering] Can the returned batch_info reference be used to modify internal state, or is it properly immutable? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::batch_info()] [Reference lifetime] Does batch_info() properly tie the reference lifetime to the Batch, preventing use-after-free when Batch is dropped? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::verify() author validation] [Zero author] Can an attacker use PeerId::ZERO or invalid PeerId values that bypass epoch_authors validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchRequest::verify() peer_id check] [Address collision] Can two different validators have colliding PeerId values, causing batch request authorization to be confused? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::verify() author equality] [Author mutation] If batch.author() can be modified after construction, can an attacker change the author after verify() passes? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::new() expiration parameter] [Zero expiration] Can batches with expiration=0 be created and accepted, causing immediate expiration and wasted consensus work? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: PersistedValue::summary() expiration handling] [Expiration wraparound] Can expiration_timestamp_secs() wrap around at u64::MAX, causing expired transactions to appear valid? (High)",
