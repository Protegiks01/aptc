  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Constant: TELEMETRY_LOG_INGEST_BUFFER_SIZE] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker manipulate the hardcoded TELEMETRY_LOG_INGEST_BUFFER_SIZE (128) to cause telemetry log overflow, where rapid log generation fills the channel buffer and drops critical security events, allowing malicious activity to go undetected? (Medium)",
