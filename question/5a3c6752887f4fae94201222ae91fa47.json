  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization DoS] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with extremely large string fields (collection_name, uri, description) to cause memory exhaustion during deserialization, leading to validator node crashes or API service disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Can malformed BCS input cause the 'maximum' u64 field to overflow or underflow during deserialization, resulting in incorrect collection supply limits that could enable unlimited token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Does BCS deserialization properly validate that the input bytes match the expected CreateCollection struct layout, or can an attacker provide bytes for a different struct type causing type confusion and potential memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic/crash] Can invalid UTF-8 sequences in the string fields (collection_name, uri, description) during BCS deserialization cause panics or undefined behavior in the indexer when processing CreateCollection events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly emit CreateCollection events with deeply nested or recursive BCS structures to exhaust CPU/memory resources during indexer event processing, causing indexer service unavailability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Malformed data acceptance] Does the deserialization validate that string lengths match the actual byte content, or can malformed BCS data with incorrect length prefixes cause buffer over-reads or out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Validation bypass] The collection_name field has no length validation in the Rust struct - can attackers create events with collection names exceeding MAX_COLLECTION_NAME_LENGTH (128 chars) if the Move contract validation is bypassed, causing indexer inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [URI validation bypass] The uri field lacks MAX_URI_LENGTH (512 chars) validation - can maliciously crafted events with excessively long URIs cause storage bloat or processing delays in the indexer database? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Injection attack] Can the collection_name, uri, or description fields contain special characters (NULL bytes, control characters, SQL/NoSQL injection payloads) that could exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems processing these events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Unicode normalization] Are string fields (collection_name, uri, description) normalized, or can attackers create visually identical collections using different Unicode representations to bypass uniqueness checks in indexer queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Empty string handling] Can collection_name or uri be empty strings, potentially causing indexer database constraint violations or breaking queries that assume non-empty collection identifiers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: maximum] [Economic attack] Can the maximum field be set to u64::MAX (18.4 quintillion) to create collections with effectively unlimited supply, bypassing scarcity guarantees and enabling token supply manipulation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: maximum] [Zero maximum handling] Can maximum=0 (unlimited supply per Move contract spec) be exploited to create collections that break indexer assumptions about supply tracking, causing incorrect total supply calculations in APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: maximum] [Arithmetic overflow] When indexers increment supply counters based on CreateCollection events, can the maximum value cause integer overflow if not properly validated against subsequent token creation events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter: maximum()] [Return value exploitation] Does the maximum() getter return u64 by value - can this cause issues if the value is later used in arithmetic operations without overflow checks in indexer business logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Field: creator] [Special address validation] Can the creator field be set to special addresses (0x0, 0x1 system addresses, core resource addresses) allowing privilege escalation if indexers grant special permissions based on creator address? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter: creator()] [Address spoofing] Does the creator() method returning &AccountAddress allow external code to incorrectly assume this address is verified, when the event could be emitted from any account if Move contract validation is bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct: CreateCollection] [Cross-account creation] Can events be crafted where creator address differs from the actual transaction sender, allowing attackers to attribute collections to victims' addresses in the indexer database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Module name mismatch] The MODULE_NAME is hardcoded as 'token' - can mismatches between this and the actual Move module name in aptos_token::token cause event type confusion or indexing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Struct name mismatch] The STRUCT_NAME is 'CreateCollection' - if the Move contract renames the event struct, could this cause silent indexing failures where events are not processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_TYPE] [Type tag manipulation] Can the lazy-initialized CREATE_COLLECTION_TYPE be exploited if TOKEN_ADDRESS is modified or points to a malicious contract, causing type confusion in event filtering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV2Type] [Event version confusion] The struct implements both MoveEventV2Type and works with legacy CreateCollectionEvent - can this dual compatibility cause processing inconsistencies when the same collection creation is indexed differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Struct field order] [Serialization mismatch] If the Rust struct field order (creator, collection_name, uri, description, maximum) doesn't match the Move struct field order, can BCS deserialization succeed but populate fields incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Can concurrent access to the CREATE_COLLECTION_TYPE Lazy static during high-load event processing cause data races or deadlocks in the indexer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection.rs] [Getter methods] [Data race] The getter methods (creator(), collection_name(), uri(), description()) return references - can these cause data races if the CreateCollection struct is accessed concurrently from multiple indexer threads? (Low)"
