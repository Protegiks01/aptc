  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 72] [Disk full] What happens if the storage backend is full when wait_for_commit_ledger() tries to persist? Is the error handled gracefully or does it cause data loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Write failure] If block persistence fails partway through (e.g., disk error), are already-committed blocks rolled back or does this create inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 72] [Durability guarantee] Does wait_for_commit_ledger() ensure blocks are durably persisted (fsync), or can a crash cause committed blocks to be lost on restart? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Storage corruption] If the underlying storage becomes corrupted, how does process() detect this? Can corrupted blocks be persisted and propagate the corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 72] [Async writes] If persistence is asynchronous, can wait_for_commit_ledger() return before blocks are actually written, causing responses to indicate success prematurely? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Pruning race] Can block pruning occur while process() is persisting blocks, causing race conditions where blocks are deleted immediately after being committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 72] [Snapshot race] Can state snapshots be taken while wait_for_commit_ledger() is executing, creating snapshots with incomplete block data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Transaction replay] Are persisted blocks protected against transaction replay attacks where the same transactions are re-executed with different outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 72] [Storage quota] Is there enforcement of storage quotas to prevent unbounded growth? Can an attacker force persistence of massive blocks exhausting disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Function: process()] [Write amplification] Does persisting each block cause excessive write amplification that degrades storage performance and affects consensus throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 77-79] [Network partition] If send_epoch_change() fails due to network partition, can this cause some validators to miss the epoch change and fork the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 44] [NetworkSender injection] Can commit_msg_tx be replaced with a malicious NetworkSender that drops epoch change messages or sends them to wrong peers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 77-79] [Message ordering] Are epoch change messages guaranteed to be delivered in order, or can out-of-order delivery cause validators to receive epoch N+2 before N+1? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 78] [Proof size] Can EpochChangeProof with a single ledger info be rejected by peers as insufficient? Should it include more historical context? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 77-79] [Broadcast scope] Does send_epoch_change() broadcast to all validators or only connected peers? Can network issues cause some validators to miss the broadcast? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 44] [Channel capacity] Is the NetworkSender's internal channel bounded? Can flooding it with epoch changes cause back-pressure and block the persisting phase? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 77-79] [Retry logic] If send_epoch_change() fails, is there retry logic or is the epoch change lost permanently, requiring manual intervention to resync validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 44] [Sender lifecycle] What happens if commit_msg_tx is dropped or closed? Will send_epoch_change() fail gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 78] [Message authentication] Are epoch change messages authenticated to prevent Byzantine validators from injecting fake epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 77-79] [Rate limiting] Is there rate limiting on epoch change messages to prevent spam attacks that could overwhelm network bandwidth? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 21-23] [Field initialization] Are all fields of PersistingRequest properly initialized, or can uninitialized fields cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 41] [Type alias] Does using type PersistingResponse = ExecutorResult<Round> hide important error information that should be explicitly handled? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/persisting_phase.rs] [Line 61-65] [Move semantics] Does moving PersistingRequest into process() transfer ownership correctly, or can there be use-after-move bugs if the caller tries to reuse it? (Low)",
