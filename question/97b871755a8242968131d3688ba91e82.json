  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sequence_number()] [Sequence overflow] If sequence_number is set to u64::MAX, can incrementing it cause overflow leading to transaction replay or account lockout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::chain_id()] [Chain ID confusion] Can attackers omit chain_id to get ChainId::test() in production, enabling cross-chain replay attacks between test and mainnet networks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::payload()] [Payload replacement] Can payload be set multiple times, with the last value winning, allowing attackers to front-run transaction construction and inject malicious payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::max_gas_amount()] [Gas limit bypass] Can setting max_gas_amount to u64::MAX bypass gas metering, allowing execution of computationally expensive operations that DoS validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::max_gas_amount()] [Gas limit underflow] If max_gas_amount is set to 0, can transactions still execute with zero gas cost, enabling free transaction spam? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::gas_unit_price()] [Gas price manipulation] Can setting gas_unit_price to 0 allow free transactions, or to u64::MAX cause integer overflow in gas calculations leading to incorrect fee charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::ttl()] [TTL manipulation] Can attackers set extremely high TTL values to make transactions valid far into the future, enabling delayed execution attacks or mempool spam? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::ttl()] [TTL = 0] If ttl is set to 0, does the transaction immediately expire causing all transactions to fail, or can it bypass expiration checks entirely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::raw()] [Default value injection] The unwrap_or() defaults (500_000 gas, 0 price, DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_TIME) - can attackers exploit these defaults to execute expensive operations cheaply or bypass intended gas restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign()] [Signature with wrong key type] The unwrap() on as_ed25519() will panic for keyless accounts - can this be exploited to DoS transaction signing, or can keyless accounts accidentally sign with dummy Ed25519 keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign()] [Private key mismatch] If sender.privkey doesn't match sender.pubkey (e.g., after incomplete key rotation), will signature verification fail silently or succeed with wrong authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign()] [Double signing] Can sign() be called multiple times on the same transaction, creating multiple signatures that could confuse validation or enable signature replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_multi_agent()] [Secondary signer count mismatch] If secondary_signer_addresses.len() != secondary_private_keys.len(), does sign_multi_agent() panic, fail gracefully, or create malformed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_multi_agent()] [Secondary signer order] Must secondary_signer_addresses and secondary_private_keys be in matching order, or can misalignment cause signatures to be attributed to wrong accounts enabling authorization bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_multi_agent()] [Empty secondary signers] If secondary_signers is empty but sign_multi_agent() is called, does this degrade to single-agent transaction or create invalid multi-agent transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_multi_agent()] [Primary signer in secondary list] If sender address appears in secondary_signer_addresses, can this cause double-signature with same key, bypassing multi-sig quorum requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_fee_payer()] [Fee payer not set] The unwrap() on fee_payer will panic if fee_payer was never set - can this cause production crashes during transaction construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_fee_payer()] [Fee payer signature order] Is the fee payer signature applied correctly after secondary signatures, or can signature order manipulation cause verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_fee_payer()] [Fee payer as sender] If fee_payer.address() equals sender.address(), does this cause double-signing with same account, potentially bypassing fee payment or creating invalid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::sign_fee_payer()] [Fee payer in secondary signers] If fee_payer appears in secondary_signers list, can this create duplicate signatures or authorization confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: CoinStore::new()] [Balance overflow] Can the coin parameter accept u64::MAX, and if so, can arithmetic operations on this balance overflow causing loss of funds or creation of negative balances? (Critical)",
