  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Struct: StateDelta] [Memory Leak] If LayeredMap holds internal references to StateSlot data, can dropping a StateDelta leak memory by not properly releasing the Arc and all nested allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Struct: StateDelta] [Debug Trait Information Leak] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive state data (keys, values, versions) that could leak through error messages or logs to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Struct: StateDelta] [Size Validation] Does StateDelta validate that base and current States have compatible shard counts, or can mismatched shard arrays (e.g., base with 8 shards, current with 16) cause panics during construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Function: new() via is_descendant_of] [Shard 0 Only Check] Since State.is_descendant_of() only checks shards[0], can an attacker craft States where shard 0 is a descendant but shards 1-15 are not, bypassing validation and creating inconsistent cross-shard deltas?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Function: new() via is_descendant_of] [Arc Pointer Equality] Does is_descendant_of() rely on Arc pointer equality which could fail if States are serialized/deserialized, incorrectly rejecting valid descendants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Function: new() via is_descendant_of] [Transitive Descendant] Can an attacker create State chains A->B->C where C.is_descendant_of(A) is false but C.is_descendant_of(B) and B.is_descendant_of(A) are true, allowing non-transitive delta creation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Function: new() via view_layers_after] [Empty LayeredMap] Can view_layers_after() return empty LayeredMaps for shards with no updates, causing get_state_slot() to incorrectly return None instead of inheriting from base?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Integration] If latest_hot_key() returns Some(key) but get_state_slot(&key) returns None, can this indicate LRU metadata corruption that breaks hot state consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Integration] Can base_version() return None while oldest_hot_key() returns Some, indicating hot state exists at pre-genesis which should be impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Attack Scenario] Can a Byzantine validator create malicious StateDelta objects with manipulated shards to propose blocks containing incorrect state roots, causing honest validators to reject valid blocks and halt consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_delta.rs] [Attack Scenario] Can an attacker exploit StateDelta to create state forks by providing different deltas to different validators, causing validators to compute different state roots for the same transactions?
