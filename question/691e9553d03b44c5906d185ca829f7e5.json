  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/module.rs] [Function: Module::new()] [Invalid Bytecode] Does Module::new() validate that the bytecode is valid Move bytecode before storage, or can malformed bytecode be stored and later crash the Move VM during execution causing loss of liveness?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/module.rs] [Function: Module::into_inner()] [Use-After-Move] Can consuming ownership via into_inner() in one execution path while another path still holds a reference lead to use-after-free bugs in unsafe code sections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/module.rs] [Function: Module::into_inner()] [Memory Leak] If into_inner() is called but the returned Vec<u8> is not properly dropped, can this cause memory leaks during high-volume module deployment operations? (Low)",
