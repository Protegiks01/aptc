  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/session.rs] [Function: Session::execute_transaction()] [Reentrancy] The write_set is applied at line 296 after execution - can an attacker craft a transaction that calls back into the session during execution to create reentrant state modifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/session.rs] [Function: Session::execute_transaction()] [Nonce Bypass] Are sequence numbers validated in simulation mode, or can an attacker replay transactions with duplicate sequence numbers to test double-spending scenarios that wouldn't work on-chain? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/session.rs] [Function: Session::execute_transaction()] [Module Bundle] Line 328 marks ModuleBundle as unreachable!() - can an attacker actually submit ModuleBundle payloads in simulation causing panic? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/session.rs] [Function: Session::execute_transaction()] [Gas Used Manipulation] The gas_used from txn_output at line 339 is stored without validation - can VM bugs report negative or MAX gas usage causing accounting errors? (Medium)",
