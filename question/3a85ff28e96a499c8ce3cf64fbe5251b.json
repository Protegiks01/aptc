  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Return: SmallVec<[Value; 1]>] [Resource Return Safety] Can implementations return resource values without proper ownership transfer, or return multiple references to the same resource, violating linear typing and enabling duplication attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Thread Safety] Although RawSafeNative is wrapped in Arc and requires Send+Sync in SafeNativeBuilder, can individual implementations have data races when accessing shared mutable state through SafeNativeContext?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Gas Front-Running] Can implementations charge gas after performing expensive operations, allowing attackers to front-run gas checks and execute costly operations before running out of gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Gas Undercharging] Can implementations use incorrect gas expressions or forget to charge for certain operations (allocations, crypto operations, I/O), enabling DoS attacks with underpriced transactions?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Hash Collision Handling] Can implementations of hashing natives fail to handle hash collisions properly, allowing attackers to create conflicting states or bypass deduplication logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Global State Access] Can implementations directly access global state (filesystem, network, system time) creating non-determinism that causes validators to diverge and split the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [State Caching Issues] Can implementations cache state in mutable statics or thread-locals that persist across transactions, causing transaction execution to depend on execution history? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Panic vs Result] Can implementations panic instead of returning SafeNativeError, causing validator crashes rather than graceful transaction failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Error Propagation] Can implementations use the automatic From<PartialVMError> conversion incorrectly, turning legitimate VM errors into InvariantViolations and masking real issues? (Medium)",
