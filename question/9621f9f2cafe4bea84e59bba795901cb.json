  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [ClusterArgs validation bypass] The ClusterArgs struct is built with Some() and None values without validating the resulting configuration - can this lead to invalid clusters that crash or behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [node_api_key injection] The node_api_key is hardcoded to None in ClusterArgs - if the target requires an API key for rate limiting, can this cause false negatives where legitimate nodes fail TPS checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [targets_file override] While targets is set to Some(vec![...]), targets_file is None - can an attacker somehow override this to load targets from a malicious file at runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Cluster build failure handling] BuildClusterError is non-retryable - if cluster building fails due to transient network issues, will legitimate nodes be permanently marked as failing without retry opportunity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [emit_workload_configs manipulation] The args_to_transaction_mix_per_phase() method is called on untrusted config - can an attacker craft workload configs that generate computationally expensive transactions to DoS the target node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Transaction mix exploitation] Different transaction types in the workload mix might have different gas costs - can an attacker configure a mix that appears to meet TPS but actually processes very little useful work? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: EmitArgs] [Emission parameter tampering] EmitArgs is flattened and comes from external config - can an attacker modify emission parameters (duration, rate limits) to make TPS checks artificially easy or hard? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Phase-based attack timing] If transaction_mix_per_phase has multiple phases, can an attacker configure phases that concentrate TPS testing in short bursts that don't reflect sustained performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Score manipulation] The evaluation_result uses score 100 for pass and 0 for fail - is this score used for weighted evaluations elsewhere, and can manipulating descriptions affect score interpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Links injection] The failing result includes .links(vec![NODE_REQUIREMENTS_LINK]) - can an attacker somehow override this constant to inject malicious URLs that redirect operators to phishing sites? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Description string injection] The description includes user-controlled values (rate.committed, rate.submitted) - can extremely large numbers cause string formatting issues or buffer overflows in downstream consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [CheckResult vector manipulation] The function returns Ok(vec![evaluation_result]) with a single result - can calling code incorrectly assume multiple results and access out-of-bounds indices? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [Serde denial of service] Complex nested structures with flattening can cause exponential deserialization time - can an attacker provide deeply nested JSON/YAML config that causes CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [Type confusion in deserialization] Multiple flattened structures might have overlapping field names - can this cause type confusion where a u64 minimum_tps is interpreted as a string or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: CoinSourceArgs] [Private key parsing vulnerabilities] The Ed25519PrivateKey is parsed from CLI/file input - can malformed key encodings (wrong length, invalid base64, etc.) bypass validation and cause crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [Default value injection] Only repeat_target_count has a custom default - can missing fields in other nested configs cause silent failures or use insecure defaults from dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Baseline assumption violation] Comments claim baseline and target have same chain ID, but this is never verified - can this assumption be violated by configuration errors or malicious setup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider trust model] The code trusts target_api_index_provider completely - if the provider is compromised, can all security guarantees of TPS checking be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Transaction emitter trust] emit_transactions_with_cluster() is trusted to return accurate stats - does the emitter verify transactions were actually committed on-chain, or just that the target node claimed to commit them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: new()] [Mint key authority assumption] The code assumes whoever has the mint key is authorized - can stolen or leaked mint keys be used to mint unlimited coins through TPS checking without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Macro: get_provider!] [Provider injection] The get_provider! macro retrieves providers from a collection - can an attacker inject malicious provider implementations by manipulating the ProviderCollection before check() is called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Common checker config bypass] The common field in TpsCheckerConfig might contain security settings - are these properly enforced, or can they be overridden by other config fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Implementation soundness] The check() function signature returns Result<Vec<CheckResult>, CheckerError> - can incorrect error handling in the calling code cause partial results to be treated as full passes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [ApiIndexProvider interface] The provider.provide() returns a response with chain_id field - is this interface properly validated, or can malicious implementations return garbage data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Zero TPS handling] If rate.committed and rate.submitted are both 0.0, the comparison logic still executes - does this correctly fail the check, or can division by zero or other issues occur? (Low)"
