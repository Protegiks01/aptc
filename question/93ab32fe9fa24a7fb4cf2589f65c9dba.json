  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/state_store.rs] [Function: set_state_value()] [State corruption] Can an attacker call set_state_value() with a maliciously crafted StateKey that overwrites critical system resources (e.g., validator configuration, governance parameters) to gain unauthorized control over the blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/state_store.rs] [Function: set_state_value()] [Resource exhaustion] Does set_state_value() have any limits on StateValue size, or can an attacker create arbitrarily large state values causing memory exhaustion and node crashes during simulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/state_store.rs] [Function: set_state_value()] [Type confusion] Can set_state_value() be exploited to store a StateValue with incorrect type metadata that later causes type confusion when deserialized as a Move resource, potentially bypassing Move's type safety?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/state_store.rs] [Function: remove_state_value()] [Validator manipulation] Can remove_state_value() delete validator-related resources during simulation, and could this affect actual validator set state if simulation results are improperly applied to production?
