  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Macro: get_provider!] [Required Field Bypass] Does setting self.config.common.required to false allow the checker to skip validation entirely when the provider is unavailable, hiding connectivity issues? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Trait: Checker] [build_result() Type Safety] Does the Self::build_result() helper properly capture the checker type name, or can type erasure cause incorrect checker identification in results? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Connection Quality] Does the checker only count connection quantity without assessing connection quality (latency, bandwidth, reliability), allowing attackers to provide low-quality connections that pass validation?
