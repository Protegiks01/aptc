  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Function: CheckerConfig::build()] [Redis Connection Pool] For RedisRatelimitChecker, can build() be exploited to create excessive Redis connections that exhaust connection pool limits, causing all future rate limit checks to fail and allowing unlimited faucet access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: Checker] [Enum Dispatch Bypass] Can the enum_dispatch macro for CheckerTrait on the Checker enum be exploited to call wrong implementations, or does Rust's type system prevent this? Could unsafe code elsewhere cast between checker types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: Checker] [Memory Layout] Does the Checker enum's memory layout allow for exploitation if adjacent enum variants have significantly different sizes, potentially causing buffer overflows or information leaks in unsafe code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Enum: Checker] [Variant Exhaustion] If new checker variants are added but not handled in match statements elsewhere in the codebase, can this cause panics or undefined behavior that attackers can trigger to crash the faucet service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate the time_request_received_secs field in CheckerData to bypass time-based rate limits, or is this timestamp set server-side and immutable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [Account Address Validation] Does CheckerData validate that the receiver AccountAddress is a valid, non-zero address before passing to checkers, or can attackers request funds to 0x0 or other invalid addresses to bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [IP Spoofing] Is the source_ip field in CheckerData derived from trusted sources (X-Forwarded-For with validation), or can attackers spoof their IP to bypass IP-based rate limiting and blocklists? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [Header Injection] Since headers is Arc<HeaderMap>, are headers properly sanitized before being stored in CheckerData, or can attackers inject malicious headers that bypass authentication or captcha checks through header parsing vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [Clone Safety] Is the Clone trait on CheckerData safe to use with Arc<HeaderMap>, or can cloning CheckerData multiple times cause reference counting issues that lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CheckerData] [Memory Overhead] Can attackers send requests with extremely large HeaderMap (thousands of headers) to cause CheckerData to consume excessive memory, leading to OOM DoS when many CheckerData instances are created? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CompleteData] [Response Status Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate the response_is_500 flag in CompleteData to falsely indicate server errors, causing rate limits to be rolled back when funds were actually transferred, allowing unlimited token drainage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CompleteData] [Transaction Hash Validation] Does CompleteData validate that txn_hashes contains valid transaction hashes, or can attackers inject empty or malicious hashes that break audit logs while draining the faucet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CompleteData] [Hash Vector Size] Can attackers cause txn_hashes Vec<String> to grow unbounded by repeatedly requesting funds, causing memory exhaustion when CompleteData is created for tracking purposes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Struct: CompleteData] [Nested CheckerData] Since CompleteData contains a CheckerData field, can this cause infinite recursion or excessive memory usage if CompleteData instances are nested or cloned repeatedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Async Cancellation] If check() or complete() async methods are cancelled mid-execution (due to timeout or client disconnect), can this leave checkers in inconsistent states where rate limits are partially updated or locks remain held? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Panic Safety] If a checker's check() method panics, does this cause the entire request handling to fail, and can attackers deliberately trigger panics to cause DoS by sending malformed requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Send/Sync Bounds] The trait requires Send + Sync + 'static - can these bounds be violated by checker implementations using thread-local storage or non-Send types, causing data races or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Lifetime Issues] Does the 'static lifetime requirement on CheckerTrait prevent checkers from holding references to request-specific data, or can this be exploited to cause use-after-free if checkers store references incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: AuthTokenChecker] Can the AuthTokenChecker bypass X_IS_JWT_HEADER check be exploited by attackers who set this header without providing valid JWT, completely bypassing token authentication and allowing unlimited faucet access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MemoryRatelimitChecker] Does the LruCache in MemoryRatelimitChecker properly handle eviction, or can attackers with many different IPs cause legitimate users' entries to be evicted from the cache, allowing those IPs to bypass rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MemoryRatelimitChecker] Can attackers exploit the clear_if_new_day() logic to reset all rate limits at day boundary by sending requests at exactly midnight, allowing burst token drainage during the transition period? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MemoryRatelimitChecker] Does the AtomicU64 current_day field properly prevent race conditions during day transitions, or can concurrent requests cause the cache to be cleared multiple times or not at all? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: MemoryRatelimitChecker] In complete() method, can decrementing requests_today for 500 errors cause underflow if the value is already 0 or 1, potentially wrapping around to u32::MAX and completely breaking rate limiting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RedisRatelimitChecker] Can attackers exploit the Redis incr operation's race condition window where a request reads current limit, checks if under limit, then increments, allowing multiple concurrent requests to all pass the check before increments occur? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/mod.rs] [Integration: RedisRatelimitChecker] Does the Redis key format (prefix:value:day) prevent key collisions between different ratelimit types, or can attackers craft keys that collide with JWT ratelimits while using IP-based ratelimiting? (Medium)"
