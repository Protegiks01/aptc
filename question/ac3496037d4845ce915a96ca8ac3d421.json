  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_borrow_box()] [Gas non-determinism] Are gas calculations guaranteed to be identical across all validators for the same operation, or can differences cause some validators to charge different gas amounts, leading to state divergence?
