  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerIssuerMode::new_rb_request] [Epoch Mismatch] Can ObservedUpdateRequest be created with an epoch that doesn't match the ProviderJWKs version metadata, causing validators in different epochs to incorrectly aggregate observations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerIssuerMode::new_rb_request] [Issuer Length] Does the function validate issuer byte vector length, or can extremely large issuers (>1MB) cause memory exhaustion when broadcast to all validators during reliable broadcast? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerIssuerMode::session_key_from_qc] [Direct Clone] Does directly returning qc.update.issuer.clone() without validation allow duplicate or conflicting session keys if multiple QCs exist for the same issuer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerIssuerMode] [Type Conversion] Can the conversion from ObservedUpdateRequest to JWKConsensusMsg and back fail to preserve the epoch field, causing reliable broadcast to accept messages from wrong epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerKeyMode::log_certify_start] [Error Swallowing] Does unwrap_or_else(|_| KeyLevelUpdate::unknown()) silently hide critical parsing errors when try_from_issuer_level_repr fails, preventing detection of malformed JWK updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerKeyMode::new_rb_request] [Context Loss] Does the .context() error wrapper preserve enough information to identify which specific field (issuer vs kid) caused the translation failure, or are errors too generic for debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerKeyMode::new_rb_request] [Partial Extraction] Can KeyLevelUpdate::try_from_issuer_level_repr succeed but extract incomplete data (missing to_upsert or base_version), causing the ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest to be inconsistent with the payload? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerKeyMode::session_key_from_qc] [Tuple Construction] Is the (issuer, kid) tuple constructed atomically, or can race conditions cause the tuple to contain mismatched issuer and kid from different updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Implementation: PerKeyMode] [DELETE Operation] Does the mode properly handle DELETE_COMMAND_INDICATOR in KeyLevelUpdate translation, or can it be confused with legitimate key data causing incorrect consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: UpdateCertifier::start_produce] [Mode Mismatch] Can UpdateCertifier be instantiated with one ConsensusMode but receive messages from a different mode during epoch transitions, causing type conversion panics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: UpdateCertifier::start_produce] [Error Propagation] When new_rb_request returns an error, does the context 'UpdateCertifier::start_produce failed at rb request construction' provide enough information to identify which mode (PerIssuer vs PerKey) failed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: UpdateCertifier::start_produce] [Session Key Error] When session_key_from_qc returns an error, does the error message 'could not identify the session key' get logged but the QC is still dropped, causing loss of valid consensus results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: UpdateCertifier] [Broadcast Await] Does rb.broadcast(req, agg_state).await.expect('cannot fail') assumption hold for both consensus modes, or can PerKeyMode introduce new failure modes that cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: ObservationAggregationState] [PhantomData] Is PhantomData<ConsensusMode> sufficient to maintain type safety, or can runtime type confusion occur if the same aggregation state is reused across mode switches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: ObservationAggregationState::add] [View Comparison] Does self.local_view == peer_view comparison work correctly for both PerIssuer and PerKey modes, or can PerKey mode have different equality semantics causing false rejections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: BroadcastStatus trait] [Type Association] Can the associated type Message = ConsensusMode::ReliableBroadcastRequest be inconsistent with Response = ObservedUpdateResponse, causing type mismatches when PerKeyMode uses ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: EpochManager::start_new_epoch] [Feature Flag Race] Can the FeatureFlag::JWK_CONSENSUS_PER_KEY_MODE be toggled during epoch transition, causing validators to use different consensus modes within the same epoch leading to network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: EpochManager::start_new_epoch] [Mode Migration] When switching from PerIssuerMode to PerKeyMode (or vice versa), are existing InProgress consensus sessions properly aborted, or can they complete with wrong mode causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Integration: EpochManager] [Type Erasure] Does boxing consensus managers as Box<dyn TConsensusManager> properly preserve ConsensusMode type information, or can dynamic dispatch cause mode confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/mode/mod.rs] [Type: JWKConsensusMsg] [Enum Variants] Can JWKConsensusMsg::ObservationRequest and JWKConsensusMsg::KeyLevelObservationRequest coexist in the same epoch, or does mixing them cause validators to misinterpret message types? (Critical)",
