  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Timeout Manipulation] Can highest_timeout_round be set arbitrarily high without actual timeout certificates, preventing validators from signing legitimate timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Timeout Manipulation] Can highest_timeout_round overflow to 0, allowing validators to sign timeout certificates for rounds they already timed out? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Timeout Safety] Does highest_timeout_round prevent signing conflicting timeout certificates for the same round, or is additional validation needed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Timeout-Vote Interaction] Can a validator timeout at round R (updating highest_timeout_round) then vote at round R, causing timeout-vote equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Default Value] Does highest_timeout_round=0 default correctly handle validators who have never timed out, or does 0 allow improper timeout signing? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Backward Compatibility] For old SafetyData without highest_timeout_round field, does #[serde(default)] defaulting to 0 allow timeout certificate replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Test: test_safety_data_upgrade] [Upgrade Attack] Does the upgrade test verify that old SafetyData (without one_chain_round/highest_timeout_round) deserializes safely, or can missing fields cause consensus safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Test: test_safety_data_upgrade] [Upgrade Attack] Can attackers exploit the upgrade path by providing old-format SafetyData to new validators, causing them to operate with incomplete safety data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Test: test_safety_data_upgrade] [Downgrade Attack] Can a validator running new code be downgraded to old code, losing track of one_chain_round and highest_timeout_round enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Attribute: serde(default)] [Upgrade Safety] When upgrading from old to new SafetyData format, does defaulting one_chain_round=0 create a window where 2-chain rule is not enforced? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Attribute: serde(default)] [Upgrade Safety] Can validators with mixed SafetyData versions (some with one_chain_round, some without) cause network-wide safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Version Mismatch] If different validators use different SafetyData struct versions, can this cause consensus divergence or split-brain scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Field Addition] When new fields are added to SafetyData in future (like one_chain_round was), is there a migration path that prevents validators from operating with incomplete safety state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Comparison Attack] Does Eq comparison treat two SafetyData instances as equal even if they have different but equivalent states, and can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Floating Point] Are all fields integer-based, or could any floating-point fields cause NaN-based equality bypass attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Vote Comparison] Does Eq properly compare last_vote Option<Vote>, or can two equivalent votes be treated as different causing spurious inequality? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Hash Collision] If SafetyData is used in hash maps, can attackers craft colliding SafetyData instances to cause hash map corruption? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Memory Leak] Can last_vote Option<Vote> cause memory leaks if Vote contains Rc/Arc cycles that prevent deallocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Panic Safety] If any SafetyData operation panics (serialization, Display, etc.), can this leave the validator in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Borrow Checker] Can mutable and immutable borrows of SafetyData fields race, causing borrow checker to miss safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Drop Safety] Does SafetyData implement Drop trait, and if so, can dropping SafetyData prematurely cause safety state to be lost? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Lifetime Safety] Does last_vote Option<Vote> have proper lifetime guarantees, or can Vote references become dangling? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Size Optimization] Is SafetyData struct layout optimized, or can padding bytes be exploited for information leakage across processes? (Low)",
