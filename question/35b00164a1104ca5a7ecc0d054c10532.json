  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [Cross-trait] [Metadata vs definition loading] Can loading a module for metadata (load_module_for_metadata) have different side effects than loading for definitions, causing state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [Integration] [Loader vs ModuleStorage] Since Loader provides unmetered_module_storage(), can implementations inconsistently delegate to ModuleStorage causing some operations to be metered and others not? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [Integration] [Gas meter state corruption] If gas_meter state is shared across multiple trait calls, can one call corrupt the meter state causing subsequent calls to charge wrong amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [Integration] [TraversalContext lifetime] If TraversalContext is reused across multiple transactions, can state from one transaction leak into another, causing security violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [Integration] [Lazy loading activation] Can lazy loading be dynamically enabled/disabled during transaction execution, causing the same transaction to have different gas costs and state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Empty type arguments] How do all loading functions handle empty ty_args slices - can this cause index out of bounds or bypass type parameter validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Maximum type nesting] Is there a limit on type argument nesting depth (e.g., Vec<Vec<Vec<...>>>), or can attackers cause stack overflow in type resolution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Zero gas limit] Can transactions with zero or near-zero gas limits exploit loader functions to perform partial loads that corrupt state before running out of gas? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Module dependency cycles] Can circular module dependencies (A depends on B depends on A) cause infinite loops in loader traversal, crashing validators? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Type parameter count mismatch] What happens if a function is instantiated with more or fewer type arguments than it declares - does verification catch this or can it cause memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Ability constraint violations] Can type arguments with missing abilities (e.g., non-Drop type where Drop required) pass initial verification but fail during execution, causing crashes? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Generic phantom types] Can phantom type parameters be exploited to load types without actually using them, avoiding gas charges while gaining access to expensive modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Type alias resolution] If type aliases are supported, can they be used to obfuscate malicious type arguments that would be rejected if specified directly? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Struct field count limits] Are there limits on struct field counts returned by load_struct_definition, or can attackers create structs with thousands of fields causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Function parameter limits] Are there limits on function parameter counts returned by load_function_definition, or can extremely long parameter lists cause stack overflow? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Bytecode version mismatch] Can loaders handle modules/scripts compiled with different bytecode versions, or can version mismatches cause deserialization errors or security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Malformed bytecode] Are all bytecode inputs validated before use, or can crafted malformed bytecode bypass checks in loader functions and cause memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Bytecode verification timing] Are modules verified before or during loading - can partial loading of unverified modules corrupt state before verification fails? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/traits.rs] [All traits] [Verification error handling] If bytecode verification fails during loading, are partial changes properly rolled back, or can failed loads leave state corrupted? (High)"
