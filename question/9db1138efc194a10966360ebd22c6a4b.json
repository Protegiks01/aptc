  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Mainnet protection bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the chain_id parameter to be None when calling sanitize() on mainnet nodes, allowing failpoints to be enabled and exposing debug functionality that could crash validator APIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Validation bypass] Does the sanitize() method properly validate all ApiConfig fields, or can an attacker set malicious values (e.g., max_gas_view_function=u64::MAX) in the config file that bypass validation and cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Race condition] If sanitize() is called concurrently with config updates, can race conditions cause partially validated configurations to be applied, leading to inconsistent API behavior across validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Disabled API bypass] When api.enabled is false, sanitize() returns early without validation - can an attacker enable the API at runtime and bypass all validation checks, potentially exposing unvalidated dangerous configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Lines: 176-183] [ChainId spoofing] Can an attacker provide a fake ChainId that reports is_mainnet()=false to bypass the failpoints check, then switch to mainnet after validation to enable failpoints on production nodes? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/api_config.rs] [Lines: 24-29] [Certificate injection] If tls_cert_path points to a symlink or is modified after sanitization, can an attacker inject malicious certificates for MITM attacks on API communications? (High)",
