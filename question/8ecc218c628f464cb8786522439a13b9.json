  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero max_working_set] What happens if max_working_set is set to 0 at line 29 - does this prevent any pool additions, or can it cause division by zero or assertion failures in add_to_pool_bounded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Pool size tracking] When accounts are added to pools at lines 67-74, is the total pool size accurately tracked, or can concurrent modifications cause size miscounting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: new()] [Seed predictability] If the StdRng passed to new() at line 25 is initialized with a predictable seed, can all account addresses be precomputed, enabling targeted attacks on specific test accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: create_transaction_generator()] [Entropy source] Does StdRng::from_entropy() at line 110 properly use system entropy, or can it fall back to weak randomness sources on systems with depleted entropy pools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [RNG fork safety] If the process forks after AccountGenerator creation, does the RNG state get duplicated, causing child processes to generate identical account sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Struct: AccountGenerator] [Field invariants] Are there any invariants between fields (e.g., addresses_pool and accounts_pool should have matching sizes), and can violations of these invariants cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Struct: AccountGeneratorCreator] [Creator immutability] Does AccountGeneratorCreator at line 81 properly maintain immutable configuration, or can external code modify the Arc<ObjectPool> references after creator construction?

  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Signature scheme] Does LocalAccount::generate() at line 53 always use Ed25519 keys, or can it generate accounts with unsupported signature schemes causing validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Multi-sig accounts] Can the generated accounts at line 53 be multi-signature accounts, and does create_account_transaction properly handle their creation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Loop iteration count] Is the loop at line 52 bounded properly by num_to_create, or can integer overflow in the range cause infinite loops or premature termination? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Iteration panic] If any operation inside the loop at lines 53-63 panics, does this leave vectors in an inconsistent state with mismatched sizes between requests, new_accounts, and new_account_addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Loop performance] Can a very large num_to_create value cause the loop at line 52 to run for extended periods, creating a blocking operation that stalls test execution? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Batch size limit] Is there a maximum safe batch size for num_to_create at line 47, beyond which transaction processing could fail or cause network congestion in tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/account_generator.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Batch atomicity] Are all transactions in the returned Vec at line 77 meant to be submitted atomically, or can partial batch submission cause issues with account availability in pools?
