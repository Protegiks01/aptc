  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/interface_generator.rs] [Function: write_signature_token()] [Vector of Signer] Can 'Vector<signer>' type be represented in interfaces when it's not allowed in actual Move code, creating impossible-to-implement function signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/interface_generator.rs] [Function: write_signature_token()] [Deeply Nested References] Can '&&&&&mut T' or similar deeply nested reference types cause issues in parsing or type checking when the interface is consumed? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/interface_generator.rs] [Context Management] [Concurrent Context Access] If Context is used from multiple threads (unlikely in single-threaded compiler), can the BTreeMap mutations cause race conditions or data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/interface_generator.rs] [Overall] [Memory Leaks] Are there any scenarios where String allocations, BTreeMap entries, or Context objects are not properly dropped, causing memory leaks during batch compilation of many modules? (Low)"
