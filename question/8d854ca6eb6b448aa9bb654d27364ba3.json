  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: verifier_config] [Consensus divergence] Can validators with different VerifierConfig settings accept different sets of modules causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: deserializer_config] [Deserialization attack] Can different DeserializerConfig values cause validators to deserialize bytecode differently leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: deserializer_config] [Binary format version] Can deserializer_config allowing newer binary formats than expected enable attacks through unsupported bytecode features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Config conflict] Can conflicting settings like optimize_trusted_code=true and paranoid_type_checks=true cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Config dependencies] Are there hidden dependencies between fields where enabling one requires enabling another for security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Type cost interaction] Do type costs interact with ty_builder limits, and can attackers exploit one to bypass the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_type_checks] [Async checks] Can async runtime checks controlled by ASYNC_RUNTIME_CHECKS OnceCell defer paranoid_type_checks allowing vulnerabilities to manifest before detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: optimize_trusted_code] [Trace recording] Does optimize_trusted_code affect trace recording for async checks, and can this cause checks to be skipped entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Field: paranoid_ref_checks] [Async ref checking] Can async paranoid_ref_checks be bypassed through specific execution patterns that don't get recorded in traces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Test coverage] Are all field combinations tested for security, or can untested config combinations introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Fuzzing] Has VMConfig been fuzzed with random field values to find crashes or consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Upgrade testing] Are config changes tested across version boundaries to ensure no consensus breaks during upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Zero limits] Can setting layout_max_size, layout_max_depth, or other limits to 0 cause division by zero or other arithmetic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/config.rs] [Struct: VMConfig] [Maximum limits] Can setting limits to u64::MAX cause integer overflow when limits are checked or incremented? (Medium)",
