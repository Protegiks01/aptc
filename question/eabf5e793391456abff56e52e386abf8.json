  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: create_monitoring_service_request()] [Request forgery] Can the simple PeerMonitoringServiceRequest::GetNodeInformation be spoofed or replayed by malicious peers to trigger excessive monitoring requests and cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Response injection] Does the code verify that monitoring_service_response actually corresponds to the monitoring_service_request that was sent, or can Byzantine peers inject unsolicited responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Parameter mismatch] Are the unused _peer_metadata and _response_time_secs parameters intentional, or do they indicate missing validation logic that should correlate response timing/source with request expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Struct: NodeInfoState] [State machine] Is there a formal state machine defining valid transitions between None and Some(NodeInformationResponse), or can the state be corrupted through unexpected transition sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: record_node_info_response()] [State overwrite] Can rapid successive calls to record_node_info_response() from a Byzantine peer cause state thrashing that prevents accurate peer assessment or creates race conditions with concurrent readers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_request_failure()] [Failure accumulation] Does RequestTracker implement bounds on failure counts, or can Byzantine peers trigger unbounded failure accumulation leading to integer overflow or incorrect permanent peer bans? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Struct: NodeInformationResponse] [Version spoofing] Can malicious peers provide false build_information to appear as trusted versions while running modified/malicious code, bypassing version-based security policies? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Version gap attack] Can attackers exploit the lack of validation between consecutive highest_synced_version responses to hide stalled synchronization by occasionally bumping versions without continuous progress? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Historical version attack] Can providing lowest_available_version far below honest network minimums allow Byzantine peers to advertise serving historical data they don't actually have, causing state sync failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: record_node_info_response()] [Write amplification] Can Byzantine peers trigger excessive write().record_response_success() calls by rapidly sending valid responses, causing lock contention and performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: update_peer_state_metrics()] [Metric flooding] Can calls to metrics::observe_value() for each peer create unbounded metric cardinality that exhausts monitoring system resources when many malicious peers connect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: get_latest_node_info_response()] [Clone DoS] Can repeated polling of get_latest_node_info_response() by many consumers trigger excessive NodeInformationResponse clones that exhaust memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Peer identity] Does the code verify that the peer_network_id in the response matches the peer that sent the request, or can peers impersonate other validators by spoofing responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_monitoring_service_response()] [Metadata trust] Is peer_metadata from PeerMetadata properly authenticated and bound to the peer's cryptographic identity, or can attackers inject false metadata to manipulate monitoring decisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: handle_request_failure()] [Lock poisoning] Can panics during request_tracker.write().record_response_failure() poison the RwLock and prevent all future state updates, effectively disabling peer monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: record_node_info_response()] [Write starvation] Can frequent reader locks on request_tracker starve writers in record_node_info_response() and handle_request_failure(), preventing state updates and causing stale monitoring data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Struct: NodeInfoState] [Lock ordering] If NodeInfoState is used with other locks in the monitoring system, is there a defined lock ordering to prevent AB-BA deadlocks across different monitoring components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Information disclosure] Does the Display implementation for NodeInfoState expose the full recorded_node_info_response in debug output, potentially leaking sensitive validator information in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Incomplete display] Does the Display implementation omit node_monitoring_config and request_tracker state, making debugging of monitoring issues difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/node_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Timing attack] Can malicious configuration of node_info_request_interval_ms create predictable request patterns that allow timing-based attacks or correlation of validator identities? (Low)",
