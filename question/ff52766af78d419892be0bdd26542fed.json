(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Multiple event schemas] [Event indexing consistency] With 4 separate event-related column families (EVENT_CF_NAME, EVENT_BY_KEY_CF_NAME, EVENT_BY_VERSION_CF_NAME, EVENT_ACCUMULATOR_CF_NAME), are cross-references validated to prevent orphaned or duplicate events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Constants: Line 38-69] [Atomic updates] When a transaction writes to multiple column families (e.g., TRANSACTION_CF_NAME + TRANSACTION_BY_HASH_CF_NAME + TRANSACTION_INFO_CF_NAME), are these updates atomic, or can partial failures leave inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Column Family Names] [Initialization order] Does the order of column family constant declarations affect database initialization sequence, and can incorrect ordering cause some schemas to reference uninitialized column families? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Constants: Line 38-69] [Missing CF creation] If a new schema is added but its column family constant isn't added to the appropriate db_options.rs function, can this cause runtime panics when trying to access non-existent column families? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Schema modules] [Version migration] When schema format changes (requiring data migration), are old column families properly preserved during migration, or can data loss occur if schemas are renamed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Constants: DEFAULT_COLUMN_FAMILY_NAME usage] [Empty CF misuse] Is the default/empty column family properly isolated from schema data, or can bugs cause critical data to be accidentally written to the default CF where it's unvalidated?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Schema modules + BCS] [Deserialization bomb] Do schemas that use bcs::from_bytes for deserialization (imported via schema modules) properly validate input size before decoding, preventing memory exhaustion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Schema modules] [Type confusion] Can malicious BCS-encoded data cause type confusion when deserializing schema values, potentially violating Move's type safety and causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Schema modules] [Version skew] If different validator nodes use different schema versions with incompatible BCS encodings, can this cause consensus failures when validators can't decode each other's state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/mod.rs] [Validation functions + BCS] [Malformed BCS] Can BCS-encoded data pass ensure_slice_len_eq/ensure_slice_len_gt checks but still be malformed (e.g., incorrect internal length prefixes), causing crashes during decoding? (High)",
