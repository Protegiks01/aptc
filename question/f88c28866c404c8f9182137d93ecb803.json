  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Epoch] [Feature persistence] Are feature flags persisted correctly across epoch boundaries? Could validator restarts cause feature flag state loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Epoch] [Validator sync] If validators join mid-epoch, do they receive current feature flag state? Could new validators execute with outdated feature sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Type] [u64 overflow] Feature flags are converted to u64 for on-chain storage. Are all enum values guaranteed to fit in u64? Could enum variants beyond u64::MAX cause overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Type] [Enum exhaustiveness] If a new FeatureFlag variant is added but the From implementations aren't updated, will compilation fail or will it panic at runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Type] [Serde deserialization] The snake_case serde rename could cause issues if feature names contain special characters. Can malformed JSON cause deserialization panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Type] [Hash stability] FeatureFlag derives Hash. If the enum definition order changes, will hash values change, breaking HashSet operations in squash()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Codegen] [Move syntax injection] Could malicious feature names or Debug output inject Move syntax that breaks parsing or changes proposal semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Codegen] [Import injection] The generated code imports 'std::features'. Can this import be hijacked or shadowed to execute different feature flag logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Codegen] [Vector literal limits] Are there limits on Move vector literals? Could extremely large feature flag lists exceed parser limits or gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Codegen] [Deterministic output] Is the generated Move code deterministic? Could non-deterministic code generation cause validators to produce different proposal hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Dependencies] [AptosFeatureFlag sync] The code depends on AptosFeatureFlag enum from aptos_types. If that enum changes without updating this file, could it cause silent mapping errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Dependencies] [get_signer_arg trust] The code uses get_signer_arg() from components module. Does this properly validate signer authority, or could it return unauthorized signers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Dependencies] [generate_governance_proposal trust] Does generate_governance_proposal() from utils properly validate all parameters, or could it be bypassed with malicious inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Dependencies] [HashValue collision] The next_execution_hash uses HashValue type. Are hash collisions possible that could cause proposal sequencing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Concurrency] [Shared Features mutation] Features struct is not Sync/Send. Could concurrent proposal generation lead to data races if Features is shared across threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Concurrency] [CodeWriter thread safety] Is CodeWriter thread-safe? Could concurrent writes to the same writer cause corrupted proposal generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Concurrency] [Iterator invalidation] If Features is modified while FeatureFlag::iter() is running in from() implementation, could it cause iterator invalidation? (Medium)"
