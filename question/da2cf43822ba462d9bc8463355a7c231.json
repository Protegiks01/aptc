  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: index] [Sequence gap] Can gaps in index sequences (e.g., index 1, 3, 5 with 2, 4 missing) be exploited to claim 'rare' low indices or manipulate rarity calculations based on index proximity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: index] [Negative index] Although index is u64 (unsigned), can integer underflow in index arithmetic elsewhere create negative-like behavior through wraparound to high values near u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: index] [Index manipulation] Can the index field be modified after token creation through Rust unsafe code or memory corruption, allowing attackers to steal 'rare' low indices from existing tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: description] [Unicode exploits] Can malicious Unicode sequences (right-to-left override, zero-width joiners, combining characters) in description cause text rendering attacks that obscure malicious content or create display inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: description] [Null byte injection] Are embedded null bytes (\\0) in description strings properly handled, or do they cause string truncation in C-style string operations leading to metadata loss? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: name] [Normalization attack] If token names are not Unicode-normalized (NFC/NFD), can attackers create visually identical names that hash differently, bypassing uniqueness checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: name] [Case sensitivity] Are token names case-sensitive, allowing an attacker to create 'Token', 'TOKEN', 'token' as distinct tokens that appear identical to users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: uri] [Protocol smuggling] Can uri fields use obscure protocols (gopher://, file://, jar:) to bypass security filters or cause unexpected behavior in metadata fetchers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: uri] [Path traversal] Can URIs contain path traversal sequences (../) that cause metadata fetchers to access unauthorized files when resolving relative paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: mutation_events] [Counter desync] Can the mutation_events counter get out of sync with the actual number of mutation events emitted, causing event loss or duplicate event sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: mutation_events] [GUID generation] Is the mutation_events GUID properly derived from the token's address and guid_creation_num, or can GUID collisions occur across different tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Field: mutation_events] [Event key leakage] Does exposing the EventHandle's EventKey allow attackers to predict future event keys for unrelated resources, potentially enabling event injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Serde: Serialize] [Canonical encoding] Does serialization produce canonical BCS encoding, or can non-canonical encodings cause hash mismatches when comparing serialized TokenResource instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Malformed input] Can malformed BCS input cause panics during deserialization rather than returning proper Result errors, potentially crashing validator nodes when processing malicious state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Version skew] If the on-chain Token struct adds new fields, does deserialization of old TokenResource format into new code fail gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Extra bytes] Does deserialization reject inputs with trailing bytes after the TokenResource data, or can extra bytes be injected to smuggle data or confuse parsers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [SQL injection] When TokenResource fields are inserted into indexer databases, are they properly escaped to prevent SQL injection attacks through malicious token metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Index performance] Can an attacker create millions of tokens with extremely long names/descriptions that cause indexer database performance degradation or disk space exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Encoding mismatch] If the indexer assumes UTF-8 but TokenResource contains non-UTF-8 sequences, can this cause database constraint violations or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: API] [JSON escaping] When TokenResource is serialized to JSON for API responses, are special characters properly escaped to prevent JSON injection or response splitting attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: API] [Response size] Can tokens with maximum-length description (2048) + uri (512) + name (128) fields cause API responses to exceed size limits, triggering truncation or errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Integration: API] [Rate limiting bypass] Can an attacker query tokens with rapidly changing mutation_events to bypass rate limiting, using the event counter as a cache-busting parameter? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Storage: State] [Partial write] Can a partial write of TokenResource during a crash leave the on-chain state in an inconsistent state where only some fields are updated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Storage: State] [Merkle proof] If TokenResource is stored in a Merkle tree, can an attacker craft tokens that cause Merkle proof generation failures or hash collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Storage: State] [Pruning] Does state pruning properly handle TokenResource instances, or can pruning delete tokens that should be retained for active collections? (High)"
