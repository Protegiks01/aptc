  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Recovery scenario] When validators restart mid-epoch, does get_key_pair_bytes() return the correct epoch's keys for resuming randomness generation, or could stale keys from previous epochs be returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Epoch cleanup] Is there automatic cleanup of augmented data from old epochs, or could storage grow unbounded with historical data causing disk exhaustion over time? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all_certified_aug_data()] [Epoch filtering] Does get_all_certified_aug_data() return data from all epochs or only the current epoch, and could mixing data from multiple epochs cause randomness generation to use wrong certified values? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Epoch transition cleanup] During epoch transitions, are remove_aug_data() and remove_certified_aug_data() properly called to clean up old epoch data, or could stale data accumulate causing state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Key confidentiality] Are the cryptographic key pair bytes encrypted at rest in the database, or are they stored in plaintext allowing anyone with disk access to steal validator randomness keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/schema.rs] [Function: encode_value() for KeyPairSchema] [Key exposure] Does BCS serialization of key pair bytes preserve entropy and prevent key material leakage through side channels during encoding? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Key validation] After loading key pairs from storage, is there validation that the cryptographic material is well-formed before using it in randomness generation, or could corrupted keys cause VUF operations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Delta validation] Are the Delta values within AugData cryptographically validated before storage, or could malformed deltas be persisted causing APK derivation to fail during augmentation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Aggregate signature integrity] Do aggregate signatures in CertifiedAugData maintain cryptographic security properties when serialized/deserialized, or could storage operations compromise signature validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Byzantine flooding] Can Byzantine validators flood the storage with thousands of augmented data entries per epoch causing disk exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Malicious certification] Can Byzantine validators with <1/3 stake create and store CertifiedAugData with forged signatures, and would honest validators detect and reject this during loading? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Memory exhaustion attack] Can Byzantine validators exploit InMemRandDb by sending excessive augmented data causing memory exhaustion in test validators or misconfigured production nodes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Deletion attack] Can Byzantine validators manipulate validator code to call remove_aug_data() excessively, deleting critical augmented data from honest validators and preventing randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all_aug_data()] [Selective censorship] Could Byzantine validators modify their local storage to exclude certain validators' augmented data, causing incomplete randomness generation that differs from honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: commit()] [Partial writes] If commit() fails midway due to disk errors, could the database be left with partial writes where some schemas are updated but others aren't, causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/interface.rs] [Cross-function consistency] If save_aug_data() succeeds but subsequent save_certified_aug_data() fails, could this leave storage with uncertified augmented data that should have been certified? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all()] [Iterator ordering] Does get_all() return results in deterministic order, or could non-deterministic iteration order cause different validators to process augmented data in different sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_all_aug_data()] [HashMap ordering] Since HashMap::into_iter() has non-deterministic ordering, could this cause validators using InMemRandDb to process augmented data in different orders breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs + in_memory.rs] [Consistency] [Implementation parity] Are the RandDb and InMemRandDb implementations semantically identical, or could subtle differences in behavior cause tests to pass while production fails? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization panic] The expect() call for 'RandDB open failed' will panic, could this cause validator startup to fail completely without graceful degradation or recovery attempts? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: commit()] [Error propagation] When commit() returns DbError, are these errors properly logged and handled by calling code, or could they be silently ignored leading to data loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: delete()] [Batch error handling] If batch.delete() fails for one key during iteration, does delete() abort or continue, and could partial deletions cause inconsistent storage state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/schema.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Deserialization failures] When BCS deserialization fails due to corrupted data, are errors properly propagated with context, or could generic errors make debugging difficult? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [All functions] [Infallibility] Since InMemRandDb operations always return Ok(()), could this hide logic errors that should be failures, making bugs harder to detect during testing? (Medium)",
