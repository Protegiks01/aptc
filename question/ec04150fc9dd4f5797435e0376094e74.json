  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function race] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability between checking if state is Some in sync_to_target() and actually using it, where end_epoch() could clear it? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function attack] Can an attacker exploit the ordering of executor.finish(), sync operation, and executor.reset() to cause state inconsistencies or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function attack] If multiple validators call sync_to_target() with different targets simultaneously, could they end up with divergent logical times or executor states? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function attack] Can the fail points in sync_for_duration() and sync_to_target() be exploited to create permanent desynchronization between validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Async safety] Are all async operations in sync_for_duration() and sync_to_target() cancellation-safe, or could cancellation leave write_mutex locked or executor in inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Async safety] If an async task holding write_mutex panics, is the mutex automatically released, or does it remain locked causing deadlock? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Async safety] Can the AsyncMutex be poisoned by panics, and if so, does this permanently break all future sync operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Async safety] Are there proper timeout mechanisms to prevent sync_for_duration() from blocking indefinitely if state_sync_notifier hangs? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Async safety] Could an attacker exploit Rust's async drop semantics to prevent proper cleanup of executor or sync state on task cancellation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Executor safety] Does calling executor.finish() multiple times (e.g., from concurrent sync operations) cause undefined behavior or resource corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Executor safety] Is executor.reset() idempotent, or could calling it multiple times or at unexpected times corrupt the executor's internal state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Executor safety] Can an executor.reset() failure leave the executor in a partially reset state that causes incorrect execution results for subsequent blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Executor safety] Are there any ordering requirements between finish() and reset() that, if violated, could cause memory safety issues or data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Executor safety] Does the BlockExecutorTrait guarantee thread-safety, or could concurrent access from multiple pipelines corrupt shared state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [State sync] Can state_sync_notifier.sync_for_duration() return success but fail to actually sync to the latest state, causing validators to lag behind? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [State sync] Does sync_to_target() verify that the target was actually reached after syncing, or could state sync stop at an earlier block? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [State sync] Can state sync operations be manipulated to sync to blocks that don't exist in the canonical chain, causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [State sync] Is there validation that synced blocks have valid state roots and transaction proofs, or could corrupted blocks be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [State sync] Can Byzantine validators provide fake sync targets that cause honest validators to sync to invalid states? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Logical time] Can logical time monotonicity be violated if sync operations complete out of order due to concurrent execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Logical time] Is there validation that logical time always advances (epoch increases or round increases within same epoch), or could it move backwards? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Logical time] Does logical time correctly handle epoch boundaries where epoch increases but round resets to 0? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Logical time] Can an attacker manipulate LedgerInfoWithSignatures to contain mismatched epoch/round values that corrupt logical time tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Logical time] If write_mutex is acquired but operation fails before updating logical time, does this create a window where operations use stale time? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Memory safety] Could the Arc cloning in pipeline_builder() create circular references that prevent garbage collection and cause memory leaks? (Medium)"
