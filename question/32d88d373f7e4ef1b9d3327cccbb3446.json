  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Commitment Binding] Can an attacker open a commitment to two different ID sets, breaking the binding property? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Commitment Hiding] Does the commitment scheme properly hide the ID set, or can an attacker deduce IDs from the digest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Knowledge Soundness] Does the proof system ensure that the prover actually knows the ID set, or can proofs be generated without this knowledge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Simulation Attack] Can an attacker simulate valid proofs without access to the secret tau value? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Trusted Setup] Does the setup in new() create a proper trusted setup, or could the setup process leak tau? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Protocol] [Multi-Party Setup] Can this system be extended to multi-party trusted setup, or is single-party setup a vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Side-Channel] [Timing Attack on Verification] Does verify_pf() execute in constant time regardless of proof validity, or can timing distinguish valid from invalid proofs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Side-Channel] [Cache Timing on MSM] Can cache-timing attacks during MSM operations leak scalar values used in proof computation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Side-Channel] [Power Analysis] Are field and group operations resistant to power analysis attacks that could leak tau or scalars? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Side-Channel] [Branch Prediction] Do conditional branches leak information about secret values through branch prediction side channels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Serialization] [Malicious Deserialization] Can crafted serialized data cause deserialization to panic, consume excessive resources, or produce invalid objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Serialization] [Version Mismatch] Are serialized objects versioned? Can old format objects be deserialized in ways that bypass new security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Serialization] [Compression Attack] If serialization uses compression, can compression bombs cause DoS during deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Serialization] [Endianness] Are serialized field elements properly handled across different endianness systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/digest.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic in Production] Can any of the unwrap() calls (line 129) panic in production scenarios with adversarial inputs? (High)",
