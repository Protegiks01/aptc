  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Edge case: Concurrent handshakes] [State corruption] Can two concurrent handshakes from the same peer cause state corruption in anti_replay_timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Edge case: Handshake retry] [Replay confusion] If a client retries a failed handshake with the same timestamp, is it incorrectly marked as replay? (Medium)",
