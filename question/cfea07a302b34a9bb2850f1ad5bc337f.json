  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Input validation bypass] Could the custom MIME type string 'application/x.aptos.signed_transaction+bcs' be spoofed or manipulated by an attacker to bypass Content-Type validation in transaction submission endpoints, potentially allowing malicious transactions to be processed incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_VIEW_FUNCTION] [Type confusion] Could an attacker exploit the similarity between BCS_VIEW_FUNCTION ('application/x.aptos.view_function+bcs') and BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION MIME types to cause type confusion in the API parser, leading to view function payloads being executed as signed transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: JSON] [Content-Type hijacking] Is the generic JSON MIME type ('application/json') sufficiently specific, or could attackers leverage JSON content-type in non-JSON endpoints to inject malicious payloads that bypass BCS deserialization security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS] [Format confusion] Could the generic BCS MIME type ('application/x-bcs') be used to submit BCS-encoded signed transactions to endpoints expecting only BCS responses, potentially bypassing transaction validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [Case sensitivity] Are MIME type comparisons using these constants case-sensitive, or could attackers bypass security checks by submitting headers like 'APPLICATION/JSON' or 'Application/X-BCS' that don't match the exact constant strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Charset injection] Does the MIME type string prevent charset parameters (e.g., 'application/x.aptos.signed_transaction+bcs; charset=utf-8'), and could such parameters enable encoding-based attacks or parser confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Vendor prefix abuse] Could the 'x.aptos' vendor prefix in the MIME type be exploited by attackers using similar prefixes like 'x.aptos-malicious' or 'x-aptos' to bypass security checks that use substring matching instead of exact matching? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: BCS_* types] [Subtype confusion] Could the '+bcs' suffix in custom MIME types cause parser confusion if not properly validated, allowing attackers to submit malformed MIME types that are incorrectly accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [MIME type mutation] If these constants were accidentally or maliciously modified during compilation or deployment, could it lead to complete API failure where no transactions can be submitted, causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [Whitespace injection] Are MIME type comparisons resistant to leading/trailing whitespace attacks where 'application/json ' (with trailing space) might bypass exact string matching while still being parsed by HTTP libraries? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS] [Accept header bypass] In accept_type.rs parse_accept(), does the Accept header parsing properly validate that only JSON or BCS constants are matched, or could attackers inject malicious MIME types that cause unexpected behavior in response serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: JSON] [Default fallback exploit] In accept_type.rs, the parser defaults to JSON when no valid Accept type is found - could this default behavior be exploited to force JSON responses for operations that should only return BCS, potentially exposing sensitive data in human-readable format? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Deserialization bomb] In transactions.rs get_signed_transaction(), when BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION content is deserialized with MAX_SIGNED_TRANSACTION_DEPTH=16, could an attacker craft a deeply nested transaction structure that passes the depth check but causes excessive memory consumption or CPU usage during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Validation bypass] In the SubmitTransactionPost enum, BCS transactions skip VerifyInput validation while JSON transactions are verified - could this discrepancy allow attackers to submit invalid or malicious transactions via BCS that would be rejected in JSON format? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: JSON] [JSON parsing vulnerabilities] When transactions are submitted with JSON MIME type, are there protections against JSON-specific attacks like prototype pollution, deeply nested objects causing stack overflow, or numeric precision issues that could alter transaction amounts? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Transaction replay] Does the use of BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION MIME type in transaction submission provide any protection against transaction replay attacks, or is replay protection entirely dependent on sequence numbers regardless of submission format? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Signature bypass] In bcs_payload.rs, BCS bytes are directly deserialized without additional validation - could an attacker submit a BCS-encoded transaction with an invalid or missing signature that passes initial parsing but fails later, potentially causing API instability? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: JSON] [Error format confusion] In error_converter.rs, all errors are forced to JSON format - could this behavior leak sensitive information if BCS-only endpoints return detailed error messages in JSON that expose internal system state or validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [MIME type mismatch errors] If an attacker submits requests with Content-Type mismatches (e.g., JSON body with BCS Content-Type header), could the error messages reveal information about internal API structure, transaction validation logic, or exploitable edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [Supply chain attack] Are these MIME type constants protected against supply chain attacks where a malicious dependency or build tool could modify the string values at compile time, causing all API endpoints to malfunction? (Critical)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: BCS_* types] [Forward compatibility] If new BCS MIME types are added in future versions, could old nodes using these constant values reject valid transactions from new nodes, causing network fragmentation or consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_VIEW_FUNCTION] [View function injection] Could an attacker exploit the BCS_VIEW_FUNCTION MIME type to submit view function calls that consume excessive resources, cause API crashes, or bypass rate limiting that applies to regular transaction submissions? (Medium)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [HTTP/2 header compression] In HTTP/2 deployments, are these MIME type constants properly handled by header compression (HPACK), or could compression attacks exploit repeated MIME type headers to cause memory exhaustion or parser confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constant: BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION] [Batch submission vulnerability] In SubmitTransactionsBatchPost, when multiple transactions are submitted with BCS_SIGNED_TRANSACTION MIME type, is there proper validation to prevent one malformed transaction from corrupting the entire batch deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: api/types/src/mime_types.rs] [Constants: All] [MIME sniffing] Do HTTP responses include X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff headers to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing responses, which could lead to security issues if BCS binary data is misinterpreted as executable content? (Low)"
