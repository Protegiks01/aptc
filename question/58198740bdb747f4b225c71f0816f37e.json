  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] Can a malicious actor provide a crafted BTreeMap through maybe_build_info containing extremely long strings (>1GB) for git hash or version labels, causing excessive memory allocation and potential OOM that crashes the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Label Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious label values through maybe_build_info (e.g., git_hash containing newlines, Prometheus special characters like '\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Format String Injection] If build_info values contain format string specifiers or escape sequences, could they cause metric formatting issues or parser exploits when consumed by monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Unicode Exploitation] Can build_info contain unicode directional override characters (U+202E, U+202D) that visually spoof git hashes or versions in monitoring dashboards, misleading operators about node versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Null Byte Injection] Can null bytes (\\x00) in build_info strings truncate metric labels prematurely, causing version/hash misrepresentation in monitoring systems? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing aptos_build_info::BUILD_COMMIT_HASH through metrics leak sensitive information about internal development branches, unreleased features, or security patches that could aid attackers in targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Version Confusion] If aptos_build_info::get_git_hash() returns an empty string or invalid hash format, does the fallback to UNKNOW_LABEL create ambiguity where multiple nodes report identical 'unknown' versions, preventing operators from detecting version inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Build Time Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate BUILD_PKG_VERSION through cargo build-time environment variables to make malicious nodes appear as legitimate versions, bypassing version-based admission control? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Hostname Spoofing] Can an attacker modify /etc/hostname or use hostname command to set arbitrary hostnames (including special characters, unicode, or extremely long strings) that get reflected in metrics and cause parsing issues in monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [System Resource Exhaustion] Does System::new_with_specifics(RefreshKind::new()) allocate significant system resources or perform blocking I/O that could be exploited if new() is called repeatedly in a tight loop, causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Race Condition] Is the Arc<Mutex<System>> created but never actually used after initialization (system.lock().host_name() is called immediately), representing dead code or a potential race condition if hostname changes dynamically? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Mutex Poisoning] If system.lock() panics due to poisoned mutex (previous panic while holding lock), does it properly handle the error or will subsequent calls to new() also panic, creating a cascading failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Leak] The Arc<Mutex<System>> is created but immediately dropped after extracting hostname - is this memory allocated unnecessarily, and could repeated instantiation cause memory pressure?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Metric Value Overflow] The gauge value is hardcoded to 1.0 - could there be edge cases where float representation issues or NaN/Infinity values cause metric collection failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Constant: UNKNOW_LABEL] [Typo Bug] The constant is named 'UNKNOW_LABEL' instead of 'UNKNOWN_LABEL' - could this typo cause issues in monitoring systems that specifically filter for 'unknown' strings, causing mis-classification of node states?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/node-resource-metrics/src/collectors/basic_node_info_collector.rs] [Function: new()] [Inconsistent Fallback] Three separate fallbacks to UNKNOW_LABEL exist - if any fail independently, could partial 'unknown' values create inconsistent node identity in monitoring causing operational confusion?
