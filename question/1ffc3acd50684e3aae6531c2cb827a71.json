  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [BCS deserialization] Can an attacker craft a malicious BCS-encoded payload with extremely large string fields (description, name, uri) that bypass length validation during deserialization, causing memory exhaustion and denial of service on validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [Type confusion] Does the deserialization process validate that the Object type in the collection field actually points to a valid Collection resource, or can an attacker substitute an arbitrary Object address to reference non-collection resources and break token-collection invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [Integer overflow] Can the index field (u64) overflow during deserialization if fed a maliciously crafted maximum value (u64::MAX), potentially causing integer wraparound bugs in downstream token indexing logic that could lead to token duplication or loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [EventHandle manipulation] Can an attacker craft a malformed EventHandle in mutation_events with manipulated counter or GUID values that bypass event ordering guarantees, allowing event replay attacks or mutation event history rewriting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [String injection] Are the String fields (description, name, uri) sanitized during deserialization to prevent injection attacks in downstream API responses, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities in web interfaces or SQL injection in indexer databases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [BCS size bomb] Can an attacker create a malicious BCS encoding with nested or repeated structures that cause exponential decompression, leading to resource exhaustion attacks during TokenResource deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [Field ordering] Does the BCS deserialization rely on correct field ordering as defined in the struct, or can an attacker reorder fields in the BCS payload to cause field confusion where index becomes description, potentially corrupting token metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Struct: TokenResource] [Serde derivation] Do the derived Serialize/Deserialize implementations properly handle all edge cases including empty strings, null bytes, invalid UTF-8 sequences, or can these cause panics or undefined behavior during token resource processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [Input validation] Does the new() constructor validate that the collection Object points to a valid, existing collection resource, or can an attacker pass an arbitrary AccountAddress to create orphaned tokens that reference non-existent collections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [Index validation] Does new() validate that the index parameter is unique within the collection and doesn't exceed the collection's maximum supply, or can an attacker create duplicate tokens with the same index causing token uniqueness violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [String length validation] Does new() enforce the Move framework's MAX_TOKEN_NAME_LENGTH (128), MAX_URI_LENGTH (512), and MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH (2048) limits, or can oversized strings cause storage exhaustion or indexer crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty string handling] Can new() accept empty strings for name, description, or uri fields, potentially creating invalid tokens that violate business logic constraints or cause indexer errors when querying token metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [EventHandle initialization] Does new() properly initialize the mutation_events EventHandle with a unique GUID and zero counter, or can reused/manipulated EventHandles cause event collision or mutation history corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [Special character injection] Does new() sanitize special characters (null bytes, control characters, Unicode directional overrides) in string fields that could be exploited for display manipulation, phishing attacks, or breaking downstream parsers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: new()] [UTF-8 validation] Are the String parameters validated for proper UTF-8 encoding, or can invalid UTF-8 sequences be stored causing panics during string operations or display corruption in user interfaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: collection()] [Reference lifetime] Does returning a reference to the collection Object create any lifetime or borrowing issues that could allow concurrent modification races where the collection address is changed while being read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: collection()] [Dangling reference] Can collection() return a reference to an Object that has been deleted or moved on-chain, causing downstream operations to access invalid memory or non-existent resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: collection()] [Information leak] Does exposing the collection Object's inner AccountAddress allow attackers to enumerate all tokens in a collection by scanning for resources at predictable addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: index()] [Index collision] Can multiple TokenResource instances exist with the same index within a collection due to lack of uniqueness enforcement, allowing token duplication attacks where identical NFTs can be minted multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: index()] [Zero index] Does index() properly handle the case where index is 0 (which should indicate an unassigned/invalid token per Move framework documentation), or can zero-index tokens be created causing confusion with uninitialized tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: index()] [Index overflow] What happens when index() returns u64::MAX - can this cause integer overflow in arithmetic operations that compute next indices or token counts in collection management logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: index()] [Index mutation] Although index() returns an immutable reference, can concurrent mutations to the underlying TokenResource corrupt the index value during reads, causing race conditions in multi-threaded token queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: description()] [Private field exposure] Does returning a String reference to the private description field leak sensitive information that should be access-controlled, or allow unintended modifications through interior mutability patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: description()] [Large string DoS] Can an attacker store an extremely large description (approaching 2048 bytes) that causes performance degradation when description() is repeatedly called in API queries or indexer operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/token.rs] [Function: description()] [Malicious content] Does description() allow retrieval of malicious content (XSS payloads, malware URLs, offensive content) that could be rendered in user interfaces without sanitization, causing security or moderation issues? (Low)"
