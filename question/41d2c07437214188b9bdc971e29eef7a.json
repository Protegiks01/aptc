  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate the relative path '../doc/.version' to cause the build system to monitor or access files outside the intended directory structure, potentially exposing sensitive information during compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply Chain Attack] If the file '../doc/.version' is compromised or replaced with malicious content, could this trigger unexpected rebuilds or build-time code injection that propagates to production binaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [File System Race] Can a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race condition occur between the cargo:rerun-if-changed check and actual file access, where '../doc/.version' is modified maliciously during the build process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Bytecode Integrity] Does the build script verify the integrity or cryptographic signature of '../move_scripts/build/Minter/bytecode_scripts/main.mv' before embedding it, or can a compromised bytecode file be silently included in the faucet binary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Symlink Attack] Can the paths '../doc/.version' or '../move_scripts/build/Minter/bytecode_scripts/main.mv' be replaced with symlinks pointing to sensitive system files, causing the build system to monitor or leak information about those files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build Reproducibility] Does the lack of checksums or version validation in the build script allow non-deterministic builds where different developers or CI systems produce different binaries from the same source, undermining supply chain security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Missing Validation] Is there any validation that '../doc/.version' contains a valid semantic version format, or can arbitrary content trigger undefined behavior in downstream build processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency Confusion] Can the relative paths be exploited in multi-workspace or monorepo scenarios where an attacker places malicious files at '../doc/.version' in a different workspace, causing the wrong files to be monitored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Move Bytecode Tampering] Since the build script monitors 'main.mv' bytecode without validation, can an attacker who gains write access to the build directory inject malicious Move bytecode that gets compiled into the faucet, potentially allowing unauthorized token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Build Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate cargo's build cache by repeatedly modifying '../doc/.version' to force unnecessary rebuilds, causing denial of service in CI/CD pipelines or developer environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Missing Existence Check] Does the build script fail safely if '../doc/.version' or the Move bytecode file doesn't exist, or does it proceed with undefined behavior that could lead to incorrect binary artifacts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Cross-Platform Path Issues] Can the hardcoded relative paths using forward slashes cause security issues on Windows systems where path resolution might behave differently, potentially accessing unintended files? (Low)"
