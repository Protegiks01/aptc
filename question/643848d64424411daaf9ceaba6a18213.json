  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract()] [Slice lifetime escape] The salt and ikm parameters are borrowed slices - can their underlying memory be freed before extract_no_ikm_check() completes at line 125, causing use-after-free and memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [PRK slice aliasing] The prk parameter at line 130 is an immutable slice - can mutable aliasing through unsafe code elsewhere modify prk during from_prk() call, violating Rust's aliasing rules and causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: extract_then_expand()] [Vector reallocation] When expand() creates the output vector at line 155, can large length values cause reallocation that invalidates references held elsewhere, potentially causing memory corruption in concurrent contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Generic Type: D] [Type constraint bypass] The complex type constraints at lines 101-104 enforce hash properties - can an attacker craft a type satisfying these constraints syntactically but violating them semantically through unsafe trait implementations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [Output length overflow] The comment at line 142 mentions 'length > D::OutputSize::to_usize() * 255' - can the multiplication overflow on platforms where usize is 32-bit if D::OutputSize is large, causing incorrect validation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hkdf.rs] [Function: expand()] [HMAC counter overflow] HKDF expand uses an internal counter - for very large output lengths approaching 255 * HashLen, can counter overflow or wrap cause output block collisions or predictable patterns? (Low)",
