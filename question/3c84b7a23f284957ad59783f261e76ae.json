  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious bytecode_path with directory traversal sequences (../, ../../) to read or write files outside the intended directory, potentially accessing sensitive system files or overwriting critical configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/bytecode.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] When package_path is provided, does read_dir_files() properly sanitize paths to prevent symlink attacks where an attacker creates symbolic links pointing to sensitive directories like /etc or ~/.ssh?
