  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Input validation] Can an attacker craft a malicious ProcessorName enum variant not handled by the match statement, causing the function to panic or return undefined behavior when new processor types are added to the upstream processor crate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Enum exhaustiveness] Is the match statement exhaustive for all ProcessorName variants?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Database connection pooling] Are the default database pool sizes in the processor configs sufficient to prevent connection exhaustion attacks when multiple processors are instantiated simultaneously in localnet?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Error handling consistency] Is the error handling consistent across all unsupported processor types?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Error message timing] Can timing analysis of bail! operations reveal information about the internal state of the localnet system, enabling attackers to map available vs unavailable processor types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Missing authorization] Is there any authorization check before allowing a caller to obtain processor configurations?

Could an attacker modify the configuration after retrieval to inject malicious parameters before the processor is instantiated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Retry amplification] For ObjectsProcessor, StakeProcessor, and TokenV2Processor, are the query_retries and query_retry_delay_ms parameters properly bounded? Could Default::default() result in infinite retries or zero delays that amplify database load? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Retry storm] If multiple processors are started simultaneously with the same retry configuration, could they create a retry storm against the database during transient failures, causing permanent service degradation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [Integer overflow] Could the query_retries or query_retry_delay_ms parameters overflow when multiplied together in the processor implementation, causing unexpected behavior or infinite loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-localnet/src/processors.rs] [Function: get_processor_config()] [ObjectsProcessor security] Does the ObjectsProcessorConfig with Default::default() properly validate object ownership and permissions?
