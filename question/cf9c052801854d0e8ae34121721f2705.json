  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: update_sequence_number()] [WriteOp Legacy] WriteOp::legacy_modification is used - are there newer WriteOp variants that should be used for security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: deposit_fa_apt()] [Creation vs Modification] Code switches between legacy_creation and legacy_modification based on existence - can race conditions cause wrong operation type? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: withdraw_fa_apt_from_signer()] [Write Set Ordering] Multiple write_set.push() operations - does order matter for state commitment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: reduce_coin_apt_supply()] [Direct State Key Write] total_supply_state_key is written directly - can this bypass resource group protections? (High)",
