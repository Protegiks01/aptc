  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::with_init_genesis_config()] [Config Override Safety] Can init_genesis_config callback set dangerous genesis parameters like min_stake=0 or min_voting_threshold=0 breaking security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::with_init_genesis_config()] [Callback Panic] If init_genesis_config panics, is genesis ceremony aborted with default config, or does it continue with partially modified config? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [RNG Security] Is the provided RNG cryptographically secure, or can predictable RNG lead to deterministic validator keys allowing precomputation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Root Key Generation] Does KeyGen::from_seed(rng.gen()) properly seed root key generation, or can the seed be predicted allowing attackers to derive the root key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Partial Validator Generation] If generate_validator_config() fails for one validator, are previously generated validators left in inconsistent states or partially written to disk? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Genesis Ceremony Failure] If genesis_ceremony() fails after validators are configured, are validator configs rolled back or left in unusable state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Config Save Failure] If save_config() fails for one validator after genesis is generated, are other validators left with inconsistent genesis/waypoint data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Return Value Security] Does returning root_key as Ed25519PrivateKey risk key exposure if caller doesn't properly secure it in memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::build()] [Waypoint Consistency] Is the returned waypoint guaranteed to match the genesis transaction, or can race conditions cause mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::generate_validator_config()] [Seed Reuse] Does calling rng.gen() for seed guarantee unique seeds across validators, or can weak RNG cause seed collisions generating identical validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::generate_validator_config()] [Template Clone] Does cloning template NodeConfig carry over sensitive data from previous validators, causing configuration leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::generate_validator_config()] [Default Stake] Is default genesis_stake_amount=10 and commission=0 secure for production genesis, or should these require explicit configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::generate_validator_config()] [Port Randomization Logic] Is the condition 'index > 0 || randomize_first_validator_ports' correct, or can it cause first validator to have conflicting ports if randomize=false? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: Builder::generate_validator_config()] [VFN Identity Reuse] Does using same vfn_identity_path for both fullnode_network and vfn_network allow both networks to share keys, breaking network isolation? (High)"
