  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Re-export] [NodeType Exposure] Does the re-export of 'NodeType' from 'node_config_loader' at line 63 allow external code to misrepresent node types, potentially bypassing role-based access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Declaration] [Missing Crypto Module] Is there a missing cryptographic configuration module that should be declared alongside 'dkg_config' and 'jwk_consensus_config' to manage other crypto parameters like signature schemes? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/mod.rs] [Module Loading] [Config File Race] Can time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities occur between when configs are loaded via these modules and when they're actually used by the node? (High)",
