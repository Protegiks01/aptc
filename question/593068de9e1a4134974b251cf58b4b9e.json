(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: InitPackage::execute()] [Local Framework Poisoning] If framework_local_dir is specified, can an attacker provide a path to a compromised local framework directory containing malicious Move modules that bypass security checks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: InitPackage::execute()] [Template Injection] When using Template::HelloBlockchain, can the hardcoded HELLO_BLOCKCHAIN_EXAMPLE contain injection vulnerabilities or outdated security practices that get propagated to new projects? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: FrameworkPackageArgs::init_move_dir()] [Manifest Serialization] Can malformed addresses in the manifest cause toml::to_string_pretty to produce invalid TOML that breaks package builds or introduces parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: CompilePackage::execute()] [Bytecode Version Mismatch] Can fix_bytecode_version produce bytecode versions incompatible with the target blockchain, allowing attackers to deploy modules that execute differently than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: CompilePackage::execute()] [Metadata Extraction] When save_metadata is true, can pack.extract_metadata_and_save() be exploited to overwrite critical build artifacts or inject malicious metadata into the package? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: CompileScript::compile_script()] [Script Count Validation] If a package contains zero scripts or multiple scripts, does the error handling properly prevent execution, or can this check be bypassed to run unintended bytecode? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: CompileScript::execute()] [Script Hash Collision] Can the script_hash calculation using HashValue::sha3_256_of be manipulated through malicious bytecode structure to produce hash collisions with legitimate scripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: fix_bytecode_version()] [Version Inference Logic] Can the bytecode version inference from language_version be exploited to compile with incompatible versions that bypass security checks in the VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: CompilePackage::execute()] [Dependency Resolution] In fetch_deps_only mode, can BuiltPackage::prepare_resolution_graph be tricked into resolving malicious dependencies from compromised git repositories? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: IncludedArtifacts::build_options_with_experiments()] [Experiment Flag Abuse] Can attackers append malicious experiments to the experiments vector to enable unstable compiler features with known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: TestPackage::execute()] [Instruction Bound Bypass] Can the instruction_execution_bound limit be bypassed through recursive function calls or loops, causing denial of service during test execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: TestPackage::execute()] [Gas Parameter Manipulation] Since tests use NativeGasParameters::zeros() and MiscGasParameters::zeros(), can this hide gas-related vulnerabilities that would manifest in production with real gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: TestPackage::execute()] [Coverage Data Poisoning] When compute_coverage is enabled, can malicious test code manipulate coverage data to hide untested critical paths or inject false coverage metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: TestPackage::execute()] [Named Address Override] Can the named_address_values mapping be manipulated to test code against different addresses than production, hiding address-dependent vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: TestPackage::execute()] [Compile Warning Bypass] Does ignore_compile_warnings allow deployment of code with critical warnings that indicate security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: PublishPackage::execute()] [Size Limit Bypass] Can the MAX_PUBLISH_PACKAGE_SIZE check (60,000 bytes) be bypassed through override_size_check to deploy oversized packages that cause storage bloat or execution issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: create_package_publication_data()] [Metadata Serialization] Can bcs::to_bytes(&metadata) fail silently or produce malformed serialized data that corrupts on-chain package registry? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/mod.rs] [Function: create_package_publication_data()] [Publish Type Confusion] Can PublishType enum variants be confused during payload creation, causing AccountDeploy to be processed as ObjectDeploy or vice versa? (Critical)",
