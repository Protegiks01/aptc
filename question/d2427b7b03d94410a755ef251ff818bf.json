  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Economic Attack] [Scaling Factor Exploitation] By manipulating scaling_factor during deserialization, can attackers amplify small rounding errors into significant fund extraction over many reward cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [State Invariant] [Total Consistency] Is there validation that distribution_pool.total_coins ≥ principal for each StakingContract, or can negative implicit rewards corrupt accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [State Invariant] [Share Conservation] Does deserialization verify that total_shares equals sum of individual shares in the distribution_pool, preventing share creation/destruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [State Invariant] [Address Uniqueness] Is there validation that all addresses (pool_address, owner_cap, signer_cap) in a StakingContract are distinct, preventing self-referential attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [State Invariant] [Non-Zero Scaling] Does deserialization ensure scaling_factor > 0 for all DistributionPool instances to prevent division-by-zero in share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [State Invariant] [Shareholder Limit Enforcement] Is the actual number of shareholders validated against shareholders_limit during deserialization, or can this constraint be violated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Precision Loss] [Integer Division Truncation] When converting between shares and coins using total_shares/total_coins ratios, can repeated deserialization with truncated values accumulate losses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Precision Loss] [Small Share Values] If individual share 'value' fields are very small (e.g., 1) relative to total_shares, can rounding errors during reward distribution cause unfair allocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Precision Loss] [Scaling Factor Mismatch] If different StakingContract instances use different scaling_factor values, can this cause inconsistent precision across contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Access Control] [Owner Capability Bypass] Since owner_cap is just an AccountAddress field, can attackers bypass ownership checks by modifying this during deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Access Control] [Signer Capability Theft] Can the signer_cap address be extracted from deserialized data and used to forge signatures for unauthorized operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Access Control] [Privilege Escalation] Can an attacker deserialize a StakingContract with their address as both owner_cap and signer_cap to gain full control over an existing contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Memory Safety] [Vector Allocation Attack] Can shares/shareholders vectors in DistributionPool be deserialized with capacity much larger than length, wasting memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Memory Safety] [Deep Nesting DoS] Since StakingContractStore contains vector of StakingContractEntry, each with StakingContract containing DistributionPool with vectors, can deeply nested structures cause stack exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Resource Exhaustion] [Event Handle Accumulation] Can event handle counters in StakingContractStore be deserialized with u64::MAX values, causing event storage overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Type Safety] [AccountAddress Validation] Does deserialization validate that AccountAddress fields contain valid 32-byte addresses, or can arbitrary byte sequences be injected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Type Safety] [EventHandle Type Safety] Are EventHandle fields properly typed during deserialization to ensure they emit correct event types, or can type confusion occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Serialization Format] [Endianness Attack] If u64 fields are deserialized from different endianness formats, can attackers craft payloads that interpret differently on different nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Concurrency] [Parallel Deserialization] If multiple threads deserialize StakingContractStore simultaneously, can race conditions cause partial updates or torn reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Concurrency] [Event Counter Races] Can concurrent deserialization of event handles cause counter mismatches or duplicate event GUIDs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Schema Evolution] [Field Addition] If new fields are added to structs in future versions, will old serialized data deserialize correctly or cause validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Schema Evolution] [Field Removal] If fields are removed, can old serialized data with removed fields cause deserialization errors that break backward compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Schema Evolution] [Type Change] If field types change (e.g., u64 to u128), can mixed-version data cause type confusion during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Edge Case] [Maximum Values] Can all u64 fields be simultaneously set to u64::MAX during deserialization, causing multiple overflow conditions when performing calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/staking_contract.rs] [Edge Case] [Minimum Values] Can all u64 fields be set to zero simultaneously, creating an invalid but deserializable state? (Medium)"
