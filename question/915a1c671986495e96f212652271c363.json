  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Information Disclosure] Can a malicious validator inject false build information via the build_info parameter that could mislead network monitoring systems about validator capabilities, potentially causing consensus participants to make incorrect assumptions about node versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Data Injection] Does the function validate the contents of the build_info BTreeMap, or can attackers inject arbitrarily large values causing memory exhaustion when telemetry events are collected and transmitted across the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Privacy Leak] Can sensitive validator infrastructure information be leaked through build_info parameters (like internal IP addresses, hardware configurations, or deployment details) that could aid targeted attacks against specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Data Validation] Is there any sanitization of string values in build_info before creating the telemetry event, or could malicious special characters or escape sequences cause issues in downstream telemetry processing systems?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Resource Exhaustion] If the build_info BTreeMap contains millions of key-value pairs, does the function have any size limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks when creating telemetry events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Key Collision] Can duplicate keys in the build_info map cause data loss or inconsistency in telemetry reporting, potentially hiding critical security events or validator misbehavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_build_info_telemetry_event()] [Async Safety] Since the function is async, are there race conditions if multiple concurrent calls try to create telemetry events with overlapping data, potentially causing data corruption in telemetry streams? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Key Injection] Can an attacker control the 'key' parameter to inject malicious keys into the BTreeMap that could later be interpreted as commands or cause issues in telemetry processing pipelines? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Memory Exhaustion] If called repeatedly with large string values, does the function have any protection against memory exhaustion attacks where attackers fill the BTreeMap with arbitrarily large entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Key Overwrite] Can existing critical keys in the map be silently overwritten by subsequent calls to insert_optional_value(), potentially hiding important validator metadata or security indicators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Unicode Handling] Does the function properly handle Unicode characters and potential encoding issues in both key and value strings that could cause parsing errors or security issues in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Null Byte Injection] Can null bytes or other control characters in the key or value parameters cause truncation or misinterpretation in telemetry systems, potentially hiding malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Empty String Handling] If value is Some(empty_string), does inserting an empty string into the map cause issues with telemetry validation or create ambiguity with missing values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: insert_optional_value()] [Concurrent Access] If the map is accessed concurrently by multiple threads, can race conditions occur during insertion that cause data corruption or loss of telemetry data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Floating Point Overflow] Can an attacker craft malicious gauge metrics with extremely large float values (near f64::MAX) that cause arithmetic overflow when summed, potentially wrapping to negative values or infinity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Precision Loss] When summing many small gauge values with occasional large values, can floating-point precision loss occur that causes inaccurate telemetry reporting, potentially hiding performance degradation or consensus delays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [NaN/Infinity Handling] If any gauge contains NaN or infinity values, does the summation properly handle these special float values, or could they propagate and corrupt all telemetry calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Negative Value Injection] Can malicious validators inject negative gauge values that could cause the total sum to be misleadingly low, hiding actual resource usage or performance metrics critical for consensus health monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Empty Metrics List] Does the function handle an empty metric_families vector correctly, or could returning 0.0 for an empty list be misinterpreted as valid data rather than missing data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Metric Bombing] Can an attacker include millions of gauge metrics in the metric_families vector to cause CPU exhaustion during summation, potentially degrading validator performance during critical consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_gauges()] [Type Confusion] Does the function verify that all metrics in metric_families are actually gauges, or could including non-gauge metrics cause panics or incorrect calculations? (Medium)",
