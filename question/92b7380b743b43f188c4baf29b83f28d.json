  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Pointer aliasing] If two different Entry allocations coincidentally get the same address (due to reuse after deallocation), can this cause Symbol collisions where different strings map to the same Symbol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From<Cow<'a, str>>] [Address space layout] Does the implementation assume a specific address space layout, making it vulnerable on systems with ASLR, tagged pointers, or other address space randomization techniques? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Size assumptions] The test verifies Symbol is size_of::<u64>(), but can changes to NonZeroU64 or platform-specific optimizations violate this assumption, breaking serialization or binary compatibility? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Cross-process security] When a Symbol is serialized as its string value and deserialized in a different validator process with a different pool, does this create security issues where Symbol equality checks fail, breaking consensus state comparison? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Pool exhaustion] Can an attacker send maliciously crafted serialized Symbols with extremely long strings to exhaust the global pool's memory during deserialization, causing out-of-memory crashes on all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Deserialization bomb] Can specially crafted serialized data cause String::deserialize() to allocate unbounded memory before Symbol::from() is called, enabling a deserialization-based denial of service attack? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Information leakage] Does serializing a Symbol reveal information about the internal pool structure or memory layout through the string representation, potentially aiding side-channel attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [String validation] Does deserialization validate that the incoming string is well-formed UTF-8 and doesn't contain malicious payloads that could exploit downstream string processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Pool pollution] Can an attacker deliberately deserialize millions of unique Symbol strings to pollute the global pool with garbage data, degrading performance for all future Symbol operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Determinism violation] If different validators deserialize the same Symbol in different orders, could this cause their pools to have different internal structures, breaking deterministic execution requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Test: test_serialization] [Pool reset vulnerability] The test shows the pool can be artificially reset - if an attacker finds a way to trigger this in production, would all existing Symbols become dangling pointers, causing catastrophic validator crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Serialization consistency] Is the serialization format stable across different Rust compiler versions and platforms, or can serialization format changes break cross-validator communication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Recursive deserialization] Can nested or recursive data structures containing Symbols cause stack overflow during deserialization through unbounded recursion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: cmp()] [Pointer comparison shortcut] The Ord implementation compares pointers first (self.0 == other.0) before comparing strings - can this optimization cause incorrect ordering if two different strings somehow get the same pointer value due to pool corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: cmp()] [String comparison consistency] If the pointer equality check passes but the strings are actually different (due to memory corruption), does the function return Ordering::Equal inappropriately, breaking sorting invariants in Move collections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: cmp()] [Performance attack] Can an attacker craft Symbol comparisons that always miss the fast pointer-equality path, forcing expensive string comparisons and degrading sorting performance in critical consensus data structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: partial_cmp()] [Trait consistency] Does PartialOrd::partial_cmp() returning Some(self.cmp(other)) maintain consistency with Eq and Hash implementations, or can this break hash map and set invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Derive: PartialEq, Eq] [Pointer-based equality] Since PartialEq and Eq are derived and use pointer equality (NonZeroU64 comparison), can hash collisions in the pool cause different strings to be considered equal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Derive: Hash] [Hash consistency] Does the Hash implementation hash the NonZeroU64 pointer value directly, and if so, does this break hash consistency across processes where the same string has different addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: cmp()] [Unsafe dereference in comparison] The cmp() function calls as_str() which performs unsafe dereference - can this be exploited during sorting operations to access invalid memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Derive: Hash, Eq] [HashMap/HashSet safety] Can Symbol be safely used as a key in HashMap or HashSet across serialization boundaries, or does the pointer-based hashing break when Symbols are deserialized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: cmp()] [Transitivity violation] If memory corruption causes pointer values to change, can this violate transitivity of the Ord implementation, breaking binary search trees and sorted collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Clone safety] Since Symbol implements Copy, can uncontrolled copying create scenarios where too many Symbol instances exist, making it impossible to track lifetime validity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: fmt() for Display] [Unsafe dereference in display] Does the Display implementation call as_str() which performs unsafe dereference, potentially causing crashes when formatting error messages or logs during consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: fmt() for Debug] [Debug format exploitation] Can an attacker trigger Debug formatting of corrupted Symbols to cause crashes in logging or debugging code paths, hindering incident response? (Medium)"
