  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum(), Line 36-37] [Error Propagation] The expect() at line 37 converts MSM errors into panics - are there legitimate error conditions (like resource exhaustion) that should be handled gracefully instead of crashing the validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum(), Line 36] [Performance DoS via MSM] Can an attacker provide extremely large arrays (e.g., 100,000+ points) to MSM causing O(n log n) or O(n²) operations that block validator threads for extended periods, causing missed consensus rounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum(), Line 38] [Projective-to-Affine Conversion Cost] The into() conversion requires expensive field inversions - can attackers trigger this conversion repeatedly in hot paths (like signature verification) to cause performance degradation affecting consensus timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Implementations: Lines 22-30 vs 32-39] [Consistency] The Fp implementation asserts on length mismatch (line 26) while Affine implementation doesn't - can this inconsistency cause some weighted_sum calls to panic while others silently compute wrong results, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Implementations: Lines 22-30 vs 32-39] [Empty Input Behavior] How do the two implementations differ when given empty slices? Does Fp return zero while Affine returns infinity/panics, and can this cause validator divergence in edge cases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Implementations: Lines 22-30 vs 32-39] [Error Handling Philosophy] The Fp implementation panics on length mismatch while Affine panics on MSM failure - is this inconsistency in error handling a potential source of non-deterministic validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Implementations: Lines 22-30 vs 32-39] [Performance Asymmetry] Fp weighted_sum is O(n) while Affine MSM is O(n log n) - can attackers exploit this performance difference to cause some crypto operations to timeout while others complete, breaking consensus timing assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Unsafe Code Assumptions] The file doesn't contain unsafe blocks but relies on arkworks - if arkworks uses unsafe code in MSM or field operations, can memory corruption in those dependencies propagate to Aptos causing validator crashes?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Dependency Chain Security] This module depends on ark_ec and ark_ff - if these dependencies have vulnerabilities or receive malicious updates, can attackers compromise Aptos cryptography through supply chain attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Signature Aggregation Usage] If this is used for BLS signature aggregation in consensus, can attackers craft signatures with carefully chosen points and scalars that exploit weighted_sum edge cases to produce forged aggregate signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Threshold Cryptography] If weighted_sum is used for threshold signature reconstruction, can attackers manipulate the weights (scalars) to recover the master secret key by solving linear equations over the field? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Parallel Execution] If weighted_sum is called concurrently from multiple threads during parallel transaction execution, can race conditions in underlying arkworks data structures cause non-deterministic results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Gas Metering] If weighted_sum operations are exposed to smart contracts (directly or indirectly), is the gas cost properly metered proportional to input size to prevent under-priced operations that enable DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Invalid Curve Attack] Can an attacker provide points that satisfy the curve equation but lie on a twist of the intended curve, passing through MSM and producing cryptographically invalid results that break pairing-based cryptography? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Rogue Key Attack] In aggregate signature verification using weighted_sum, can attackers exploit the lack of proof-of-possession by crafting rogue public keys that cancel out honest validators' signatures? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Batch Verification Bypass] If weighted_sum is used for batch signature verification, can attackers craft invalid signatures that nonetheless produce the expected weighted sum through carefully chosen scalar combinations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Point Compression Artifacts] If input points were deserialized from compressed format, can decompression errors or ambiguities cause different validators to compute weighted_sum over different point sets?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Constant-Time Violations] Are all cryptographic operations in weighted_sum implementations constant-time?
