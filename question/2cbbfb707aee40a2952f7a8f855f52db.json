  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Event ordering assumptions] Does the indexer assume CoinRegister events are processed in strict transaction order? Can out-of-order event processing (due to parallel execution or reorgs) cause the indexer to have an inconsistent view of which accounts have registered which coins? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Missing event handling] If a CoinRegister event fails to deserialize due to corrupted data, does the indexer skip it silently or does it fail loudly? Can this be exploited to cause selective event omission attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Event hash collisions] If event hashes are computed from BCS-serialized CoinRegister data, can an attacker craft two different CoinRegister instances that produce the same hash, potentially enabling event substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Merkle proof manipulation] If CoinRegister events are included in Merkle trees for state commitment, can the flexible structure of TypeInfoResource allow an attacker to manipulate the tree structure to create fake Merkle proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Overall: Version compatibility] [Breaking changes] If the Rust struct definition changes (e.g., field types, field order, new required fields), will this break backward compatibility with existing events stored in the blockchain, potentially making historical data unreadable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Overall: Version compatibility] [Protocol upgrade timing] During a protocol upgrade that changes CoinRegister event structure, can timing differences in validator upgrades cause some validators to emit old-format events while others emit new-format events, leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Overall: Version compatibility] [Migration path] Is there a clear migration path if CoinRegister needs to be extended with additional security-critical fields (e.g., registration timestamp, gas price at registration)? Can the lack of versioning cause migration failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: REST API] [Event query filtering] When the REST API allows querying CoinRegister events by account or type, can an attacker craft queries with malicious TypeInfoResource patterns to cause regex DoS or excessive database queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: REST API] [JSON serialization mismatch] When CoinRegister events are serialized to JSON for API responses, can inconsistencies between BCS and JSON serialization cause semantic differences that confuse API consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: GraphQL] [Type field exposure] If a GraphQL API exposes TypeInfoResource fields, can an attacker enumerate all registered coin types on the chain to identify vulnerable or deprecated coins for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Economics] [Registration spam] Can an attacker spam CoinRegister events by registering thousands of fake coin types to bloat the event database and increase indexer storage costs, potentially forcing indexer operators out of business? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Economics] [Front-running registration] Can an attacker monitor the mempool for pending coin registration transactions and front-run them by submitting their own registration transaction with higher gas, potentially claiming valuable coin type namespaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [CPU exhaustion] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes that trigger exponential-time algorithms in the deserializer (e.g., through hash collision attacks in internal HashMaps), causing the indexer to hang or become unresponsive? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Storage amplification] Can the combination of unbounded TypeInfoResource vectors and high-frequency event emission cause storage amplification where a small transaction creates massive amounts of event data that exhausts indexer disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Address linkability] Does the emission of CoinRegister events expose which accounts hold which coin types, enabling chain analysis attacks that link pseudonymous addresses and deanonymize users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Timing analysis] Can the timing of CoinRegister event emission reveal information about transaction ordering or user behavior that enables front-running or MEV extraction attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Zero-sized types] Can TypeInfoResource describe zero-sized types (ZSTs) that cause unexpected behavior in the Move VM or indexer when attempting to track coin registrations for such types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Recursive type definitions] Can the struct_name field in TypeInfoResource contain recursive or circular type definitions (e.g., 'Coin<Coin<Coin<T>>>') that cause infinite loops when parsed or validated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Fuzz testing gaps] Has this function been subjected to comprehensive fuzz testing with malformed, truncated, or adversarial BCS inputs to identify parsing vulnerabilities that could crash validators or indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Static: COIN_REGISTER_TYPE] [Module address hardcoding] The StructTag uses CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (0x1) hardcoded - if the Aptos framework is ever moved to a different address, will all CoinRegister event handling break catastrophically? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Field visibility] Both fields are public - should they be private with validated accessors to prevent construction of invalid CoinRegister instances that bypass business logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Overall: Testing coverage] [Missing tests] The file contains no unit tests - are there comprehensive integration tests that verify all edge cases, error conditions, and malicious inputs are handled correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Integration: Native execution] [Event emission consistency] When native execution paths create CoinRegister events (as opposed to Move execution), can inconsistencies between native and Move event creation cause validators to disagree on event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/coin_register.rs] [Struct: CoinRegister] [Clone implementation] There's no explicit Clone implementation - if downstream code attempts to clone CoinRegister instances, can this cause performance issues or unexpected behavior with the owned TypeInfoResource? (Low)"
