  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: SharedMempool::new()] [Config validation] Does the constructor validate MempoolConfig and TransactionFilterConfig for safe values, or can extreme parameters cause crashes or resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: SharedMempool::new()] [Subscriber capacity] Can an attacker register unlimited subscribers causing the subscribers Vec to grow unboundedly and slow down notify_subscribers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: PeerSyncState::new()] [Bucket mismatch] If different peers use different num_broadcast_buckets or num_sender_buckets values, can this cause synchronization failures when exchanging MempoolMessageId? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Struct: UseCaseHistory] [History overflow] Can the use_case_history configuration values (num_blocks_to_track, num_top_to_track) be set to extreme values causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: MempoolClientRequest::GetTransactionByHash] [Hash algorithm security] What hashing algorithm does HashValue use, and can it be exploited for collisions to retrieve wrong transactions or cause cache poisoning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Type: MempoolSenderBucket] [Bucket distribution] If sender address hashing has poor distribution, can many addresses collide into the same bucket causing that bucket to become a bottleneck? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Test: test_multi_bucket_timeline_ids_update] [Coverage gaps] The test only validates successful update scenarios - are there tests for validation failures, concurrent updates, or edge cases like empty/max values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Test: test_message_id_ordering] [Bit manipulation validation] The ordering tests use manually constructed values with bit shifts - are there tests validating that from_timeline_ids() produces correctly ordered message IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Test: test_message_id_ordering] [Decode validation] The tests don't validate decode() correctness - can malformed encoded values pass ordering tests but fail during actual use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: QuorumStoreResponse::GetBatchResponse] [Transaction validity] Can GetBatchResponse return transactions that have become invalid between selection and delivery, causing consensus to fail batch validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Enum: QuorumStoreResponse::CommitResponse] [Empty response handling] CommitResponse() returns no data - how does the caller distinguish between success and different types of failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/types.rs] [Function: broadcast_within_validator_network()] [Configuration race] During quorum store enable/disable transitions, can the RwLock be held causing broadcast operations to block and degrade performance? (Medium)"
