  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Backwards compatibility] If older chain versions had CreateCollectionEvent with fewer fields, can new nodes deserialize old events, or will this cause sync failures when bootstrapping from genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Malformed enum tags] Although this struct has no enums, if BCS bytes contain unexpected enum variant tags where strings are expected, could deserialization produce garbage data instead of failing cleanly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Length prefix attacks] BCS uses length prefixes for strings - can attackers provide length prefixes that would cause reads beyond available buffer, leading to buffer over-reads or crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Empty collection name] Can collection_name be an empty string '', and if so, does this break uniqueness constraints or cause panics in indexer code expecting non-empty names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: uri()] [Null URI] Can the uri field be empty or contain only whitespace, potentially causing indexers to fail when attempting to fetch metadata, leading to incomplete collection records? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: maximum()] [Zero maximum edge case] When maximum is 0, does this mean unlimited supply or is it an invalid state, and can this ambiguity be exploited to bypass supply caps in different implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: description()] [Massive description DoS] Can the description field contain millions of characters (up to BCS limits), causing memory exhaustion when displayed in UI, effectively DoSing marketplaces showing the collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Special address values] If creator is set to 0x0, 0x1 (framework), or 0xFFFF...FFFF, are there special behaviors that could be exploited for privilege escalation in indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [State sync disruption] During fast sync, if validators encounter malformed CreateCollectionEvent that crashes deserialization, could this halt state sync causing the node to fall behind and lose liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Deterministic execution violation] If event serialization is non-deterministic (e.g., HashMap field ordering), could different validators produce different state hashes, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Transaction execution DoS] Can transactions emit thousands of CreateCollectionEvent instances in a single block, overwhelming event processing pipelines and slowing down validator block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE] [Type tag consensus] If validators have different versions of the type tag (e.g., due to partial upgrades), could they disagree on event classification causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Storage amplification] If each field (especially uri and description) is indexed separately in databases, can attackers create collections with maximum-length fields to amplify storage costs beyond their gas payment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: collection_name()] [Index poisoning] If collection_name is used as a database index key without sanitization, can attackers inject SQL/NoSQL special characters that corrupt index structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Corrupted event log recovery] If event storage is corrupted and try_from_bytes() fails, does the recovery process skip the corrupted event or halt, potentially preventing validators from catching up? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Pruning safety] When historical events are pruned from storage, can the lack of event sequence numbers or timestamps cause ambiguity about which events to keep for ongoing collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: creator()] [Privilege escalation] If indexers use the creator field for access control without verifying the event came from an authenticated transaction, can attackers inject events claiming admin privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Struct: CreateCollectionEvent] [Cross-account event injection] Can events emitted from account A claim creator as account B, allowing unauthorized collection creation under another user's identity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor bypass] Since new() is public, can off-chain code construct CreateCollectionEvent instances without going through Move validation, potentially injecting invalid events into indexing pipelines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Generic type confusion] If CreateCollectionEvent is used in generic contexts expecting different event types, could type erasure allow collection events to be interpreted as mint events or transfer events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Static: CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE] [Type args manipulation] Although CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT_TYPE has empty type_args, if future versions add generics, could type argument mismatch allow event substitution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Version downgrade] Can attackers force V2 events to be interpreted as V1 CreateCollectionEvent by manipulating version metadata, bypassing newer security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Dependency: bcs] [Supply chain attack] If the bcs crate is compromised, could malicious deserialization code in try_from_bytes() leak collection creator private keys or inject backdoors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Dependency: serde] [Deserialization gadget] Are there known serde deserialization gadgets that could be triggered by crafted CreateCollectionEvent bytes to achieve arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/create_collection_event.rs] [Import: move_core_types] [Type definition mismatch] If move_core_types and the Rust types diverge (e.g., AccountAddress size changes), could this cause silent data corruption during event processing? (High)"
