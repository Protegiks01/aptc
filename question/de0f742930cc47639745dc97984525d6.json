  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportRequest] [Resource exhaustion] Can a malicious actor flood the transport_reqs_rx channel with DialPeer requests containing invalid or unreachable NetworkAddress values, causing unbounded memory growth and eventual node crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportRequest] [Channel poisoning] If the oneshot::Sender in DialPeer is never consumed or the receiver is dropped, does this create a memory leak or channel backpressure that could degrade validator performance over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportRequest] [PeerId spoofing] Can an attacker submit DialPeer requests with arbitrary PeerId values that don't match the actual peer at the NetworkAddress, potentially causing connection confusion or routing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportHandler] [State corruption] Are the FuturesUnordered collections (pending_inbound_connections, pending_outbound_connections) bounded, or can they grow unboundedly if upgrades never complete, leading to memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportHandler] [Race condition] Can concurrent access to transport_notifs_tx from multiple async tasks lead to message reordering or dropped notifications that could cause PeerManager to miss critical connection events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportHandler] [Time manipulation] Is the TimeService properly synchronized across validators, or could clock skew/manipulation affect elapsed_time calculations and connection timeout logic causing consensus disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Struct: TransportHandler] [Generic type safety] Can malicious TSocket implementations bypass AsyncRead/AsyncWrite safety guarantees to inject malformed data into the connection stream, potentially corrupting protocol messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on failure] Does the unwrap_or_else panic at line 70 create a DoS vector where an attacker can force transport.listen_on() to fail repeatedly by exhausting port resources or manipulating network configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: new()] [Address binding race] Can an attacker win a race condition to bind to the listen_addr before the validator, causing the validator to panic and fail to start, effectively preventing network participation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: new()] [NetworkAddress validation] Is the listen_addr properly validated before passing to transport.listen_on(), or can malformed addresses cause parsing errors that expose internal state through error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel capacity] Are transport_reqs_rx and transport_notifs_tx bounded channels, or can unbounded growth lead to memory exhaustion if consumers lag behind producers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: new()] [Listener fuse] Does the fuse() wrapper on listener at line 83 properly handle edge cases where the listener stream ends unexpectedly, potentially leaving connections in limbo? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [Select bias] In the futures::select! macro at line 101, is there priority bias that could allow an attacker to starve certain branches (e.g., inbound connections) by flooding another branch (e.g., dial requests)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [FuturesUnordered ordering] Can the lack of ordering guarantees in FuturesUnordered cause completed upgrades to be processed out-of-order, leading to connection state inconsistencies in PeerManager? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [Unbounded queue growth] If upgrade futures complete slower than new connections arrive, can pending_inbound_connections and pending_outbound_connections grow unboundedly, exhausting memory and crashing the node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [Loop termination] What triggers the 'complete' branch at line 118, and can an attacker force premature loop termination to stop all connection handling, causing total loss of network connectivity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [Channel closure] If transport_reqs_rx is closed unexpectedly, does select_next_some() handle this gracefully, or could it cause a panic or infinite loop consuming CPU resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: listen()] [Listener exhaustion] If self.listener produces connections faster than they can be upgraded, can this create backpressure that prevents legitimate validator connections from being accepted? (High)",
