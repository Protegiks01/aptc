  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: Args struct] [Boolean logic error] Does the module_input boolean properly control all branching logic, or can edge cases cause the compiler to treat input as both module and script simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/main.rs] [Function: main() serialization] [Serialization non-determinism] Does CompiledModule::serialize() produce deterministic output?
