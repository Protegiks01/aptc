  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Crypto: Signature Grinding] Can an attacker generate many RoundTimeout messages and grind signatures until finding one that accidentally verifies under a different validator's key? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Crypto: Subgroup Attacks] Are BLS signatures in RoundTimeout properly validated to be in the correct subgroup, or can small-subgroup attacks forge signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Crypto: Signature Batch Verification] If multiple RoundTimeout signatures are batch-verified, can one invalid signature in the batch cause all to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Timing: Verification Time] Can an attacker measure verification time differences between valid and invalid RoundTimeout messages to infer validator key material? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Timing: Round Timing] Can precisely-timed RoundTimeout messages manipulate consensus round progression to favor certain validators as leaders? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Timing: Timeout Race] Can a validator send RoundTimeout and block proposal messages simultaneously to create race conditions in timeout vs proposal handling? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Integration: ValidatorVerifier Bypass] Can weaknesses in the ValidatorVerifier used by verify() at line 99-105 allow forged RoundTimeout messages to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Integration: TwoChainTimeout Exploit] If TwoChainTimeout.verify() at line 98 has vulnerabilities, can they be leveraged through RoundTimeout to compromise consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Integration: SyncInfo Inconsistency] Can malformed SyncInfo that passes the lightweight checks at lines 154-166 cause crashes when fully verified later in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Critical: Safety Violation] Can a Byzantine validator construct a RoundTimeout that verifies correctly but violates AptosBFT safety rules, allowing double-signing or equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Critical: Liveness Attack] Can coordinated RoundTimeout messages from <1/3 Byzantine validators permanently halt consensus by preventing timeout certificate formation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Critical: State Divergence] Can inconsistent RoundTimeout verification across validators cause state divergence leading to chain splits requiring hard forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Critical: Epoch Transition] Can malicious RoundTimeout messages during epoch transitions cause validators to accept invalid validator sets, compromising network security? (Critical)"
