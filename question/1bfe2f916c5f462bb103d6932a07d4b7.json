  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [BCS compatibility] Is the serde serialization format compatible with BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization) used by Move, or can format mismatches cause state corruption when bridging Rust and Move? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leak] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive timing information that could be used by attackers to predict future block timestamps or validator behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Storage: StateKey] [Key collision] When TimestampResource is stored under StateKey::resource_typed at @aptos_framework, can an attacker create a key collision that overwrites or corrupts the timestamp resource? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Storage: BCS encoding] [Encoding consistency] Does the BCS encoding of TimestampResource produce deterministic output across different validator implementations, or can encoding variations cause state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Storage: Read operations] [Race condition] When multiple threads read TimestampResource from state storage during parallel transaction execution, can race conditions cause transactions to see inconsistent timestamp values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Storage: Write operations] [Write atomicity] If the timestamp update fails halfway through writing to state storage (e.g., disk failure), can partial writes corrupt the timestamp resource and require rollback? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Storage: Cache coherency] [Stale cache] If validators cache the TimestampResource value, can stale cached timestamps cause validators to accept blocks with invalid timestamps that should be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Consensus: Block proposal] [Timestamp source] When validators read TimestampResource to validate proposed block timestamps, can time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) races cause consensus to accept invalid timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Consensus: Monotonicity] [Monotonicity bypass] Does every code path that updates TimestampResource enforce strict monotonicity (new > old), or can NIL blocks, reconfiguration blocks, or error handling paths bypass this check? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Consensus: NIL blocks] [Timestamp equality] For NIL blocks that require timestamp equality with parent, does the validation properly compare TimestampResource values, or can floating-point precision issues cause spurious rejections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Consensus: Epoch boundaries] [Epoch transition] During epoch reconfiguration, is the TimestampResource properly preserved across epochs, or can epoch changes reset or corrupt the timestamp causing time to jump? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Consensus: Fork handling] [Fork divergence] If the blockchain forks due to Byzantine validators, can different fork branches have conflicting TimestampResource values that prevent fork resolution and require manual intervention? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Move VM: Resource loading] [Load failure] When the Move VM loads TimestampResource during transaction execution, can load failures (resource missing, corrupted) cause transaction panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Move VM: Type checking] [Type safety] Does the Move VM properly type-check TimestampResource before loading, or can type confusion bugs allow loading incompatible types as timestamps causing memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Move VM: Gas metering] [Gas exhaustion] When reading TimestampResource during every transaction prologue, can gas metering errors cause transactions to run out of gas prematurely or get free timestamp reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Move VM: Access control] [Unauthorized access] Does the Move VM enforce that only @aptos_framework and @vm_reserved can modify TimestampResource, or can malicious contracts bypass access control to manipulate time? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Move VM: Parallel execution] [Parallelism conflicts] During Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent reads of TimestampResource from multiple threads cause read-after-write hazards or inconsistent timestamp views? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Contract: now_microseconds()] [Timestamp staleness] When smart contracts call timestamp::now_microseconds() during execution, do they see the current block's timestamp or the previous block's, and can this discrepancy be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Contract: now_seconds()] [Division truncation] The now_seconds() function divides microseconds by 1,000,000 - can integer truncation cause contracts expecting second precision to behave incorrectly near microsecond boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Contract: Time-dependent logic] [MEV extraction] Can attackers exploit known future TimestampResource values to front-run or manipulate time-dependent contract logic (e.g., auctions, vesting, oracles) for profit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Contract: Deadline checks] [Deadline bypass] If contracts implement deadline checks using TimestampResource, can validators manipulate timestamps within consensus bounds to extend or shorten deadlines for their benefit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Contract: Rate limiting] [Rate limit bypass] Can attackers exploit timestamp manipulation to bypass rate limiting mechanisms in smart contracts that use timestamp deltas to enforce cooldowns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Dependency: block.move] [Update sequence] If block.move fails to call timestamp::update_global_time during block_prologue, does TimestampResource remain stuck at old values causing time to freeze? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/timestamp.rs] [Dependency: genesis.move] [Initialization] If genesis initialization fails to create TimestampResource via set_time_has_started(), can the blockchain start without a timestamp causing all time-dependent logic to panic? (Critical)",
