  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Transcript Integrity] When sending DKGTranscript via send_rpc(), is the transcript cryptographically bound to the sender's identity preventing impersonation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Man-in-the-Middle] Does send_rpc() use authenticated encryption for DKG messages, or can a network attacker intercept and modify transcript data in transit? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [TODO Comment] The TODO comment states 'we shouldn't need to expose this' - does this indicate a design flaw where network ID abstraction is broken? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [NetworkId Hardcoding] Always using NetworkId::Validator prevents DKG from working on test networks or multiple network contexts - is this a security limitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Network Client Reliability] Does send_rpc() handle network_client failures gracefully, or can network layer crashes propagate to DKG causing total ceremony failure? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Malicious Transcript Response] Can send_rpc() receive a malicious TranscriptResponse containing invalid cryptographic data, and does it validate the transcript before accepting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Transcript Size Limit] Are there size limits on DKGTranscript payloads in to_bytes_by_protocol(), or can malicious transcripts cause serialization of multi-gigabyte data? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Await Deadlock] Can send_rpc().await deadlock if the underlying network_client's send_to_peer_rpc() never completes, hanging the entire DKG ceremony? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Async Cancellation Safety] If send_rpc_raw().await is cancelled, does it properly clean up network resources, or can this leak connections? (Medium)",
