  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 212-227] [Split Brain] During network splits, can rapid connection/disconnection events cause split-brain scenarios where subsets of validators have inconsistent views of network topology? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 374-382] [Disconnect Timeout Partition] The 50ms timeout for disconnects is very short - can this cause incomplete disconnections where network state is corrupted, leading to persistent partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 214-218] [Partial Partition] If only some validators in a network partition get NewPeer events, can this lead to inconsistent health checking across the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 304] [Validator Forgiveness] Byzantine validators can reset their failure counters by sending Ping requests to other validators - can this allow them to maintain connectivity despite consensus protocol violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 318-330] [Validator Liveness Manipulation] Validators control when they respond to Pings - can Byzantine validators selectively respond only during epochs when they're not proposing, avoiding disconnection while still able to vote? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 244-264] [Validator Resource Exhaustion] Health checker pings all connected peers - if a validator has many peer connections, can health check traffic impact consensus message delivery during critical rounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: new(), line 110] [Validator Threshold] ping_failures_tolerated is configurable - can validators with permissive thresholds maintain connections to Byzantine peers longer than others, creating network inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 216-217] [State Initialization Race] create_peer_and_health_data() is called asynchronously - can race conditions during peer initialization cause state corruption if pings are processed before initialization completes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 223-225] [State Cleanup Race] remove_peer_and_health_data() during LostPeer - can pending ping responses arrive after cleanup, causing attempts to update non-existent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 354-355] [Failure Increment Atomicity] increment_peer_round_failure() may not be atomic with get_peer_failures() - can this lead to lost increments or double counting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 329-330] [Success Reset Atomicity] reset_peer_round_state() updates round state - can concurrent failures during this update cause inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_request(), line 287-293] [Silent Serialization Failure] When Pong serialization fails, only a warning is logged and the peer never receives a response - can this cause false positive health failures for honest peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 383-391] [Ignored Disconnect Errors] Failed disconnects only generate warnings - can accumulated failed disconnects lead to resource leaks or zombie connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: ping_peer(), line 423] [Generic Error Wrapping] RpcError::Error wraps all send_to_peer_rpc errors - can important error details be lost, preventing proper failure categorization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 175-177] [Missing Network Shutdown] When network_interface returns None, health checker exits - is cleanup performed properly or can this cause resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 158-159] [Ticker Precision] time_service.interval() relies on time service precision - can time service bugs or clock skew cause health check intervals to become irregular? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: ping_peer(), line 419] [Timeout Precision] ping_timeout Duration is passed to send_to_peer_rpc - can timeout precision issues cause premature timeouts or timeouts that never fire? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 374] [Disconnect Timeout 50ms] Fixed 50ms timeout for disconnects - is this sufficient for all network conditions or can legitimate disconnects fail in slow networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 266-268] [Response Processing Order] tick_handlers.select_next_some() may process responses out of order - can this cause newer ping results to be overwritten by older ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 231] [Unchecked Addition] self.round += 1 without overflow checking - while u64 is large, can extremely long-running nodes experience overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: handle_ping_response(), line 365] [Comparison Overflow] failures > self.ping_failures_tolerated comparison - can u64 overflow in failure counting cause incorrect comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Struct: Ping/Pong, line 89-92] [Nonce Wrapping] u32 nonce can wrap - while this is expected for random values, can wrapping during sequential generation cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 168] [Network ID Caching] self_network_id is cached from network_context - can network_id changes during runtime cause events to be filtered incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/mod.rs] [Function: start(), line 214] [Network ID Comparison] ConnectionNotification filtering by network_id - can network_id spoofing in events bypass the filter? (Medium)",
