  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationMode] [Authentication bypass] Can a malicious peer exploit the MaybeMutual authentication mode to bypass public key verification by presenting themselves as an unknown peer, gaining unauthorized access to the validator network and potentially intercepting consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationMode] [Key exposure] Does the x25519::PrivateKey stored in AuthenticationMode variants get properly zeroized when dropped, or could it remain in memory allowing key extraction through memory dumps or side-channel attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Authentication downgrade] Can an attacker manipulate the authentication_mode field in TransportContext to downgrade from Mutual to MaybeMutual authentication after builder creation, weakening security guarantees for validator connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 254-263] [Key reuse] Is the same x25519::PrivateKey being used for both MaybeMutual and Mutual authentication modes without proper key derivation, potentially enabling cross-protocol attacks or key compromise? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: build_with_transport()] [Key handling] Does the private key get cloned or moved during transport creation, and could this lead to multiple copies of the key in memory without proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Struct: TransportContext] [Chain ID manipulation] Can an attacker modify the chain_id field after TransportContext creation but before transport build, causing the node to connect to wrong blockchain network and potentially accepting invalid consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: add_protocols()] [Protocol injection] Can a malicious client call add_protocols() to inject unsupported or deprecated protocol IDs that could bypass validation logic, enabling them to send crafted messages that crash the peer manager? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 58-61] [Protocol set race condition] Is the supported_protocols ProtocolIdSet manipulation in add_protocols() thread-safe, or can concurrent calls cause race conditions leading to inconsistent protocol support across different connections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Struct: TransportContext] [Proxy protocol bypass] Can the enable_proxy_protocol flag be manipulated to bypass origin IP validation, allowing attackers to spoof their source address and evade connection rate limiting or IP-based access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 265-268] [TCP buffer manipulation] Can an attacker influence tcp_buffer_cfg values to set extremely large or small buffer sizes that cause memory exhaustion or TCP performance degradation on validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 178-182] [Channel exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the pm_reqs_tx channel (bounded by channel_size) with malicious PeerManagerRequests to block legitimate consensus messages, causing validator unavailability and liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 184-185] [Connection request DoS] Is the connection_reqs_tx channel properly bounded, or can an attacker spawn unlimited connection requests to exhaust memory and prevent legitimate validator connections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: add_upstream_handler()] [Handler replacement attack] Can a malicious component call add_upstream_handler() multiple times for the same ProtocolId to replace legitimate handlers with malicious ones, hijacking consensus or mempool messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 122-129] [Handler registration race] Are concurrent calls to add_upstream_handler() from multiple threads properly synchronized, or can race conditions corrupt the upstream_handlers HashMap causing message routing failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: add_connection_event_listener()] [Listener exhaustion] Can unbounded calls to add_connection_event_listener() create unlimited event channels that consume memory and CPU broadcasting events to all listeners? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Double-build vulnerability] The function uses take() to extract transport_context, but what prevents build() from being called twice through unsafe access patterns, potentially creating multiple PeerManagers with conflicting state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 245-248] [Option unwrap panic] Does the expect() call on transport_context.take() create a panic vulnerability if build() is accidentally called twice, causing validator node crash during reconfiguration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Multiple start race] Can start() be called concurrently or multiple times, spawning duplicate peer manager tasks that compete for the same network resources and cause message duplication or state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 365-368] [Start without build] Is there proper validation preventing start() from being called before build(), which would panic and crash the validator node during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: transport_context()] [Null pointer dereference] Can calling transport_context() after build() cause a panic that crashes the node, enabling DoS by triggering this during critical consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 269-306] [Address validation bypass] Does the match statement on listen_address properly validate all network address formats, or can malformed addresses bypass validation and cause transport creation to fail silently? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Lines: 346-347] [Address mutation] The listen_address gets modified after PeerManager construction to append public key - can this cause inconsistency if other components cached the original address before this mutation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/builder.rs] [Function: listen_address()] [Address spoofing] Does listen_address() return a clone that can be safely modified by callers, or does it expose internal mutable state that could be exploited to change the listening address after initialization? (High)",
