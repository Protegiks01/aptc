  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: InvalidSyncRequest] [Consensus safety violation] Can a malicious validator exploit the InvalidSyncRequest error condition by deliberately sending sync requests where target version equals pre-committed version to cause validators to diverge on their sync state, potentially leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: InvalidSyncRequest] [State inconsistency] Does the InvalidSyncRequest error (lines 32-35) properly handle the edge case where multiple consensus notifications arrive concurrently with the same target version that equals pre-committed version, potentially causing race conditions in sync request validation? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: InvalidSyncRequest] [Version manipulation] Can an attacker exploit timing windows where pre-committed version updates to equal the sync target version between validation check and error creation, causing InvalidSyncRequest to be returned incorrectly and blocking valid sync operations? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: InvalidSyncRequest] [Liveness attack] Can a Byzantine validator deliberately trigger InvalidSyncRequest errors by manipulating consensus sync notifications to match pre-committed versions, potentially halting state synchronization progress and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: InvalidSyncRequest] [Information leakage] Does the InvalidSyncRequest error message expose internal version numbers that could be used by attackers to infer validator sync state and plan targeted attacks on synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: OldSyncRequest] [Replay attack] Can an attacker replay old sync requests that trigger OldSyncRequest errors (lines 40-41) to cause validators to waste resources processing and rejecting stale synchronization attempts, degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: OldSyncRequest] [Version confusion] Does the OldSyncRequest error properly validate that sync_target_version is checked against both pre-committed AND committed versions atomically, or can race conditions cause incorrect error classification leading to sync failures? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: OldSyncRequest] [Consensus divergence] Can validators disagree on whether a sync request is 'old' due to different local committed/pre-committed versions, causing OldSyncRequest to be returned inconsistently across the network and breaking consensus agreement? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: OldSyncRequest] [Integer comparison attack] Are the version comparisons for OldSyncRequest vulnerable to edge cases where Version type wraps around at maximum values, potentially misclassifying valid requests as old and halting sync?

  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: SyncedBeyondTarget] [Version overflow] Does the SyncedBeyondTarget error handle the case where committed_version exceeds target_version due to integer overflow or wraparound, potentially masking critical synchronization bugs? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: SyncedBeyondTarget] [Race condition] Can concurrent sync operations cause committed version to race ahead of target version, triggering SyncedBeyondTarget errors that prevent legitimate consensus notifications from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: SyncedBeyondTarget] [State corruption detection] Does SyncedBeyondTarget properly indicate a critical state corruption issue that should halt the validator, or can it be ignored allowing validators to continue with inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: SyncedBeyondTarget] [Notification handling] Can the SyncedBeyondTarget error be weaponized by sending malicious target versions that are intentionally lower than current committed version to disrupt consensus sync notification handling?

  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: IntegerOverflow] [Arithmetic attack] Can attackers trigger IntegerOverflow errors (lines 28-29) by manipulating version arithmetic in state sync calculations to cause validators to reject valid sync operations and halt progress? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: IntegerOverflow] [Version arithmetic] Does the IntegerOverflow error properly catch all version arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) across state sync, or can unchecked overflows bypass this error and cause silent corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Enum Variant: IntegerOverflow] [Panic vs Error] Can IntegerOverflow errors be triggered in panic-unsafe contexts during consensus-critical operations, potentially causing validator crashes instead of graceful error handling? (High)",
