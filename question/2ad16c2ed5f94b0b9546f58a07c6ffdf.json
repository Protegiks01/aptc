  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Description length] Are there length limits on code_description strings, or could extremely long documentation strings (megabytes) cause memory or serialization issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_categories()] [Description sanitization] Does ErrorDescription sanitize documentation strings to remove control characters, nulls, or other problematic characters before serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Address type mismatch] The code matches Address::Numerical(AccountAddress::ONE) - what happens if the address is Address::Named or other variants, and could this bypass the error module check? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [AccountAddress equality] Does AccountAddress::ONE correctly represent address 0x1, or could there be endianness or encoding issues that cause false negatives in the comparison? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Multiple addresses] If multiple modules at different addresses are all named 'error', does the code correctly identify only the one at address 0x1, or could other 'error' modules inject categories? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Zero code] Can error constants have abort code 0, and does this create ambiguity with success codes or special sentinel values? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Reserved codes] Are there reserved abort code ranges that should be rejected (e.g., system codes, framework codes), or can any u64 value be used? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Value consistency] If a constant is defined in multiple modules with different values, does this create conflicts in the error map? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Struct: ErrmapGen] [Lifetime safety] The ErrmapGen struct borrows GlobalEnv and ErrmapOptions with lifetime 'env - could the referenced data be dropped before ErrmapGen is dropped, causing use-after-free? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Borrow conflicts] Does passing &ModuleEnv to both build_error_categories() and build_error_map_for_module() create any borrow conflicts that could cause compilation failures or unsafe behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Format injection] Does ErrorMapping::to_file() use a structured format (JSON, TOML, etc.) that prevents injection attacks, or could malicious error descriptions break the file format? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Encoding issues] Does to_file() properly handle UTF-8 encoding of all strings, or could non-UTF-8 sequences in error descriptions cause file corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Atomic write] Does to_file() perform an atomic write (write to temp file, then rename), or could crashes during writing leave a corrupted partial error map file? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: save_result()] [Downstream parsing] If the generated error map is parsed by runtime error handling code, could malformed entries cause runtime crashes when errors are reported? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map_for_module()] [Error code conflict] Can the same abort code be used in different modules with different meanings, and could this cause confusion in runtime error reporting leading to security misdiagnosis? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Build dependency] If error map generation fails, does it properly fail the build, or could a successful build ship without error maps causing runtime debugging failures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Error aggregation] When build_error_map() returns an error, is it propagated immediately, or should multiple errors be collected and reported together for better debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Partial success] If gen() processes 100 modules and fails on the 99th, is the partial ErrorMapping state discarded or could it be saved, creating an incomplete error map? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Error context] Does the bail!() error message include sufficient context (module name, constant location) to debug the issue, or could vague errors make malicious code hard to identify? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Impl: Default for ErrmapOptions] [Secure defaults] Are the default values (error_prefix='E', output_file=MOVE_ERROR_DESC_EXTENSION) secure, or could these defaults be exploited if not overridden? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Impl: Default for ErrmapOptions] [Extension collision] Could MOVE_ERROR_DESC_EXTENSION collide with other file extensions in the build output, causing the error map to overwrite important files? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: new()] [Uninitialized output] The new() constructor creates a default ErrorMapping - could calling save_result() before gen() create an empty or invalid error map file? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-errmapgen/src/errmapgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Multiple calls] Can gen() be called multiple times on the same ErrmapGen instance, and if so, does it append to the existing ErrorMapping or clear it first, potentially causing duplicate entries? (Medium)",
