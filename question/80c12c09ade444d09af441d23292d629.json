  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Type confusion] Does converting success bool to string at line 65 ensure consistent formatting, or could different boolean representations ('true' vs 'True' vs '1') cause telemetry analytics to misinterpret command outcomes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: collect_cli_info()] [Encoding issues] Are command and error strings at lines 63-70 properly encoded for transmission, or could UTF-8 encoding issues, null bytes, or binary data cause corruption or truncation in telemetry storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [MitM attack] Does prepare_and_send_telemetry_event at lines 40-46 validate TLS certificates and enforce HTTPS, or can man-in-the-middle attackers intercept telemetry containing sensitive build information, commands, and error details? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [DNS poisoning] Can DNS poisoning attacks redirect telemetry data to attacker-controlled endpoints, enabling collection of validator operator commands, infrastructure details, and operational patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Replay attack] Can captured telemetry packets be replayed to the telemetry service to pollute analytics with duplicate events, skewing performance metrics or triggering false alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Endpoint validation] Does the function validate that the telemetry endpoint is an authorized Aptos Foundation service, or can environment variable manipulation redirect telemetry to arbitrary attacker-controlled servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Authentication bypass] Does the telemetry service at line 40 require authentication, or can unauthenticated attackers send arbitrary fake telemetry data to pollute Aptos metrics and analytics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Authorization check] Is there verification that only legitimate Aptos CLI binaries can send telemetry, or can forked/modified CLI versions spam the telemetry service with malicious data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Rate limiting] Does the telemetry transmission have rate limiting to prevent a single user from flooding the service with events, potentially causing DoS or inflating usage metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [UUID collision] Does uuid::Uuid::new_v4() at line 36 use a cryptographically secure random source, or can UUID collisions or predictable UUIDs enable session correlation or user tracking attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [PRNG seeding] If the UUID generator is seeded with insufficient entropy on validator nodes with limited randomness sources, can attackers predict UUIDs and correlate telemetry events to specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [UUID enumeration] Can the random UUID at line 36 be enumerated or brute-forced by attackers to identify all CLI users in the telemetry database, enabling user enumeration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [TODO comment] The TODO comment at line 35 about 'better way of identifying each CLI user' suggests the current UUID-per-invocation approach is inadequate - does this mean user tracking is intentionally incomplete, or does it create security risks from incomplete correlation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Hard-coded chain ID] The hard-coded 'NO_CHAIN' value at line 42 indicates CLI commands are not associated with specific chains - can this cause confusion in multi-chain deployments or enable cross-chain attack attribution evasion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Missing metrics] Does the telemetry system capture sufficient metrics to detect anomalous CLI usage patterns (e.g., rapid-fire commands, unusual command sequences, failed authentication attempts) that could indicate compromised validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an extremely large build_information BTreeMap at line 20, causing excessive memory allocation when combined with telemetry event serialization, leading to CLI crashes or validator node OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: collect_cli_info()] [String explosion] Can extremely long command or error strings at lines 63-70 cause memory exhaustion or buffer overflows in downstream telemetry processing systems that don't expect multi-megabyte strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Blocking operation] Does the blocking await at line 47 create a DoS vector where slow telemetry endpoints can hang CLI operations indefinitely, disrupting validator automation that depends on timely command completion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Timeout missing] Is there a timeout on the join_handle.await at line 47, or can network partitions or unresponsive telemetry services cause the CLI to hang indefinitely, blocking critical validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Weak randomness] Does the UUID generation at line 36 use the system's cryptographic random source (/dev/urandom), or could weak entropy sources on embedded validator hardware lead to predictable UUIDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Timing attack] Can timing analysis of the latency parameter at line 22 reveal information about cryptographic operations (key generation, signing) performed during CLI commands, enabling side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: send_cli_telemetry_event()] [Credential leak] Does the function sanitize command strings at line 21 to remove common credential patterns (--private-key=..., --secret=..., APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY=...) before transmission, or are credentials transmitted in plaintext to telemetry servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/cli_metrics.rs] [Function: collect_cli_info()] [Sensitive data] Can build_information at line 61 contain sensitive fields like compilation paths, developer usernames, git branches, or internal version numbers that reveal infrastructure details to telemetry recipients? (Medium)",
