  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Lines 75-77] [ABI Availability] Can the absence of ABIs (extract_abis() returning None) be exploited to skip bindings generation for malicious packages that should have their interfaces exposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Line 76] [ABI Extraction] Does extract_abis() properly sanitize ABI data, or can malicious Move modules inject code through crafted function signatures or parameter names? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Line 110] [Code Injection] Can malicious ABIs containing special characters or code snippets inject arbitrary Rust code through the rust::output() function? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Line 102] [Atomic Write] Does std::fs::write() perform atomic writes, or can partial writes due to crashes leave corrupted release bundles that validators might load? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Lines 101-102] [Directory Creation Race] Is there a race condition between create_dir_all() and write() where another process could modify directory permissions or create symlinks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Line 102] [File Overwrite] Does the write operation overwrite existing release bundles without validation, potentially replacing legitimate releases with malicious ones? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Lines 20-41] [ReleaseOptions Struct] Are there any validation constraints on ReleaseOptions fields to prevent malicious or malformed input from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_builder.rs] [Line 24] [Vector Input] Can the packages vector be empty, causing no packages to be built but still creating an empty release bundle that validators might accept? (Medium)",
