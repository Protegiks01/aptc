  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [GCS Blob Name Collision] Since backup_restore::gcs::generate_blob_name() uses chain_id and epoch but snapshot_folder_name() also uses these same parameters, could there be a collision where local folder names don't map correctly to remote GCS blob names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Epoch Boundary] During epoch transitions, if snapshot_folder_name() is called with the new epoch number before the previous epoch's snapshot is complete, could this cause concurrent access to snapshot directories leading to incomplete or corrupted snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Chain ID Validation] Are chain_id values validated before being passed to snapshot_folder_name(), or could invalid/malicious chain_id values (e.g., 0, u64::MAX) cause unexpected behavior in downstream filesystem operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [TableInfoService Snapshot Creation] When table_info_service::TableInfoService::snapshot_indexer_async_v2() calls snapshot_folder_name(), if the generated folder name already exists (from a previous failed snapshot), could this cause the new snapshot to overwrite incomplete data, leading to corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [GCS Backup Operator] In backup_restore::gcs::GcsBackupRestoreOperator::backup_snapshot_if_present(), when scanning for snapshot folders using snapshot_folder_prefix(), could an attacker create fake snapshot folders matching the prefix pattern to trigger unnecessary backup operations or DoS the backup service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Snapshot Directory Cleanup] After backup_the_snapshot_and_cleanup() completes, if the snapshot folder (created via snapshot_folder_name()) deletion fails, could accumulated old snapshots exhaust disk space and cause indexer service failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Restore Path Construction] When restore_db_snapshot() uses snapshot_folder_name() to determine the restore target path, could there be a mismatch between the downloaded snapshot structure and the expected local path, causing restore failures or data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Concurrent Snapshots] If multiple threads simultaneously call snapshot_folder_name() with the same chain_id but different epoch values during an epoch transition, could this create race conditions where both threads believe they're creating the authoritative snapshot for their respective epochs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Scanning Race] If one thread is scanning for snapshot folders using snapshot_folder_prefix() while another thread is creating a new snapshot via snapshot_folder_name(), could the scanner miss the in-progress snapshot or include a partially created one in its results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [No Error Handling] Since snapshot_folder_name() returns a String without Result<>, are there any edge cases where format!() could panic (e.g., out-of-memory), causing unexpected service crashes during critical snapshot operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Silent Failures] If snapshot_folder_prefix() generates an invalid folder name that causes downstream filesystem operations to fail silently, could this lead to missing backups without any alerting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Library Design] [Tight Coupling] Since both utility functions are defined in lib.rs but heavily used by backup_restore and table_info_service modules, could changes to the folder naming scheme require coordinated updates across multiple modules, increasing the risk of inconsistencies during upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Library Design] [No Versioning] The snapshot folder naming scheme has no version identifier - if the format needs to change in the future (e.g., for security fixes), how would old and new snapshots coexist without causing confusion or restoration failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Negative Testing] Are there any assumptions about chain_id and epoch being non-zero or within certain ranges, or could callers pass 0 values that create confusing folder names like 'snapshot_chain_0_epoch_0' that might conflict with test data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_prefix()] [Regex Matching] If any code uses the prefix string as a regex pattern for matching snapshot folders, could special characters in the chain_id numeric string be misinterpreted as regex metacharacters, causing incorrect matching behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-table-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: snapshot_folder_name()] [Case Sensitivity] On case-insensitive filesystems (like macOS HFS+ or Windows), could snapshot_folder_name() collisions occur if the naming scheme is later extended with alphabetic characters but the case varies? (Low)"
