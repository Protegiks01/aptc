  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [AuthZ: Module attributes] [Privilege inheritance] Module-level skip attributes apply to all functions (lines 82-86) - can attackers use module-level skips to mass-disable security checks across entire modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [InfoLeak: Error messages] [Sensitive data exposure] When checkers report issues via check(), are error messages sanitized, or can they leak sensitive compiler internals or private function implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [InfoLeak: FunctionTarget access] [Metadata exposure] Checkers receive full FunctionTarget with all metadata - can malicious checkers extract and exfiltrate sensitive information about other modules or system internals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [InfoLeak: known_checker_names] [Enumeration attack] The known_checker_names set reveals all available checkers - can attackers use this information to systematically identify and skip all security-critical checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [InfoLeak: Pipeline composition] [Attack surface disclosure] The get_applicable_linter_pipeline() returns the full list of active checkers - does this reveal which security checks are enabled, helping attackers craft exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Security: Determinism] [Non-deterministic execution] If checker execution order is non-deterministic (lines 39-41), can this cause inconsistent validation results across different compilation runs or validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Security: Completeness] [Coverage gap] Only stackless bytecode checkers are executed (line 70) - are there security issues detectable only in other representations that are missed by this processor? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Security: Defense in depth] [Single point of failure] If LintProcessor is the only security validation stage, does bypassing it (e.g., via skip attributes) completely disable security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Security: Audit trail] [Missing logging] There's no apparent logging of which checks were skipped or executed - can attackers bypass checks without detection or audit trail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Security: Fail-secure] [Default-permit] When external_checks is empty (line 60-62), no validation occurs - is this a secure default, or should compilation fail when security checks are unavailable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Pipeline: Processor ordering] [Dependency violation] LintProcessor assumes liveness analysis is complete (per comments line 5-6) - if executed out of order, can this cause incorrect lint results or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Pipeline: Data consistency] [State corruption] FunctionData passes through unchanged (line 42) - if previous processors left data in inconsistent state, does this propagate errors to subsequent stages?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Pipeline: Global state] [Cross-contamination] Multiple functions are processed sequentially - can global state mutations in one checker affect validation results for subsequent functions? (High)",
