  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [API Key Exposure] The node_api_key is passed as Option<String> - can this key be leaked through error messages or logs during simulation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Script Order Dependency] Does simulate_multistep_proposal() enforce ordering constraints, or can reordering scripts bypass security checks in multi-step proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Account Funding] The simulation creates an account with 100 APT balance - can this unlimited funding be exploited to test attacks that require large balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Deterministic RNG] Uses KeyGen::from_seed([0; 32]) - does this predictable RNG allow attackers to predict account addresses and craft targeted exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Sequence Number] Scripts use script_idx as sequence_number - can sequence number gaps or duplicates cause transaction validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Gas Price Manipulation] The transaction uses min_price_per_gas_unit - can attackers exploit low gas prices to execute expensive operations cheaply? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Max Gas Amount] Script transactions use max_gas_amount(100000) - can scripts exceeding this limit fail unexpectedly, hiding bugs in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [TTL Manipulation] Scripts use ttl(u64::MAX) - does this allow transactions that would timeout in production, masking time-dependent bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Script Arguments] Scripts receive TransactionArgument::U64(DUMMY_PROPOSAL_ID) - can mismatched argument types cause type confusion in governance functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [VM Environment] Does AptosEnvironment::new_with_injected_create_signer_for_gov_sim create security gaps that wouldn't exist in production VMs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Transaction Index] AuxiliaryInfo uses transaction_index: 0 for all scripts - can this cause issues with transaction-dependent logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Gas Profiling] When profile_gas is true, does GasProfiler::new_script properly track all gas consumption, or can some operations be unmetered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [HTML Report Generation] Can gas_log.generate_html_report() be exploited through path traversal to write files outside the intended directory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Transaction Materialization] Does try_materialize_into_transaction_output properly validate all state changes, or can malformed outputs corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Status Check] The function checks for ExecutionStatus::Success - can scripts with MoveAbort status other than MAGIC_FAILED_NEXT_EXECUTION_HASH_CHECK bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Last Script Validation] Only the last script checks for non-zero next_execution_hash - can intermediate scripts set next_execution_hash without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Framework Overwrite] The comment mentions 'previous script could have overwritten the framework' - can malicious scripts replace core framework modules mid-execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Coin Supply] The TODO comment mentions not updating coin info (total supply) - can this cause supply inconsistencies that break economic invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_multistep_proposal()] [Reconfiguration] The TODO mentions ensuring scripts trigger reconfiguration - can scripts that don't reconfigure cause state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: collect_proposals()] [Path Traversal] Can collect_proposals() be exploited through symlinks or path traversal to read Move files outside the intended root_dir? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: collect_proposals()] [Directory Traversal] Does WalkDir::new(root_dir) follow symlinks that could lead to infinite loops or access to sensitive directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: collect_proposals()] [File Extension Check] The function only checks extension == 'move' - can files with 'Move' or 'MOVE' extensions bypass this check on case-insensitive filesystems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: collect_proposals()] [Sorting Order] Does sorting move_files and result affect execution order in ways that could hide bugs dependent on script execution sequence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: collect_proposals()] [Empty Proposals] The function filters out directories with no .move files - but can empty proposals cause issues if they have specific semantic meaning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_all_proposals()] [Failure Propagation] If one proposal fails in simulate_all_proposals(), are subsequent proposals still processed, potentially leaving the simulation in an inconsistent state? (Medium)"
