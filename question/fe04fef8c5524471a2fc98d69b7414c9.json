  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::new()] [State initialization] Can an attacker exploit the initialization of an empty PartialSignatures struct to cause the builder to accept invalid initial state, potentially leading to invalid certificate generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::new()] [Reference counting] Can multiple Arc references to AugDataCertBuilder lead to race conditions where signature aggregation happens concurrently from different threads, causing double-counting of votes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::new()] [Epoch validation] Does the constructor validate that the aug_data epoch matches the epoch_state, or can an attacker create builders with mismatched epochs to generate certificates for wrong epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Signature verification bypass] Can a Byzantine validator exploit the signature verification at line 49 by providing a signature that passes verification but is actually invalid, potentially allowing them to contribute to quorum without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Double voting] Does add_signature() at line 51 prevent a validator from adding multiple signatures with different peer identities, allowing a single Byzantine validator to count as multiple validators and reach quorum threshold illegitimately?

(High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Voting power manipulation] At line 55, does check_voting_power properly validate voting weights, or can a Byzantine validator manipulate their weight to reach the threshold with fewer signatures than required? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Signature aggregation failure] If aggregate_signatures() at line 61 fails with expect(), can this cause a validator node crash and lead to loss of liveness when processing signatures from Byzantine validators?

(Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Signature replay] Does the add() method prevent replay of the same signature multiple times, or can a Byzantine validator send the same valid signature repeatedly to inflate vote counts? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Epoch mismatch] Can signatures from different epochs be mixed together in partial_signatures, allowing an attacker to use old signatures to reach quorum in a new epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Author verification] Does verify() at line 49 properly check that the peer parameter matches the author in the AugDataSignature, or can an attacker submit signatures claiming to be from different validators?

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Voting power overflow] Can the sum of voting powers in check_voting_power() at line 55 overflow if malicious validators have maximum weight values, causing incorrect quorum validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Clone overhead] Does cloning aug_data at line 63 create a deep copy that could be manipulated after certificate creation, or could this lead to inconsistent certificate data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Function: AugDataCertBuilder::add()] [Partial aggregation] Can an attacker stop sending signatures just before reaching quorum threshold, causing the reliable broadcast to hang indefinitely without completing? (High)",
