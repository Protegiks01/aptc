  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Storage gas params failure] If storage_gas_params at line 138-139 returns Err, does the Unexpected error propagation at line 142 ensure all validators fail identically, or can some validators succeed while others fail causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Resolver inconsistency] Can the resolver parameter at line 54 return inconsistent state snapshots between fetch_config calls at lines 88 and 89-90, causing validation against mismatched DKG and epoch state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Weak randomness] Can attackers exploit weak randomness in DefaultDKG to predict or manipulate the DKG process such that transcripts verify successfully but produce attacker-controlled shared secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Threshold manipulation] Can the threshold parameters in pub_params at line 101 be manipulated to require fewer honest participants than expected, weakening the BFT security of the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Partial contribution attack] Does verify_transcript at line 107-108 ensure all expected validators contributed to the DKG, or can transcripts with missing contributions from Byzantine validators be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Biased randomness] Can malicious validators bias the randomness generated through DKG by submitting specially crafted transcripts that verify but produce predictable or manipulable shared random values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Zero-knowledge proof bypass] If the transcript contains zero-knowledge proofs, can attackers create fraudulent proofs that verify at line 107-108 but don't actually prove knowledge of discrete logs or other required cryptographic properties? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Partial state update] If FINISH_WITH_DKG_RESULT execution at lines 120-128 fails after partially updating on-chain state, can this leave the DKG system in an inconsistent state requiring manual intervention? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [State rollback vulnerability] After successful execution returns at line 144, can subsequent transaction failures in the same block cause the DKG result state changes to be rolled back, creating validator set inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Competing DKG results] If multiple valid DKG transcripts are submitted concurrently for the same epoch, how does the system ensure only one is committed without creating state divergence across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [in_progress state cleanup] After successful DKG result publishing, is the in_progress state properly cleared to prevent stale session data from affecting future DKG rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [BCS version mismatch] Can attackers use different BCS serialization versions between transcript creation and deserialization at line 102-104 to bypass verification while appearing valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Encoding canonicality] Does bcs::from_bytes enforce canonical encoding, or can multiple BCS representations of the same logical transcript cause consensus disagreement when validators use different decodings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Verification context injection] Can attackers inject additional context or parameters into DefaultDKG::verify_transcript beyond pub_params and transcript that weaken verification security?
