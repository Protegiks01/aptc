  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [URL Injection] Can an attacker pass a malicious jwks_uri parameter pointing to an internal network endpoint (e.g., 'http://localhost:8080/admin') to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and access internal validator services? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [URL Validation] Does the function validate that jwks_uri uses HTTPS protocol, or can an attacker provide an HTTP URL to enable man-in-the-middle attacks and serve malicious JWKs that break signature verification? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Protocol Downgrade] Is the config_url required to use HTTPS, or can an attacker provide an HTTP URL that allows network attackers to inject a malicious jwks_uri through response manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [URL Parsing] Can an attacker craft URLs with encoded characters, Unicode homoglyphs, or URL fragments that bypass validation but resolve to malicious endpoints (e.g., 'https://trusted.com@evil.com/')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [DNS Rebinding] Can an attacker exploit DNS rebinding by providing a domain that initially resolves to a valid OpenID provider but later changes to an internal IP address during subsequent fetches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [URL Length] Can an attacker provide an extremely long config_url that causes buffer overflows, memory exhaustion, or crashes in the HTTP client or URL parser? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [TLS Certificate Validation] Does reqwest::Client properly verify TLS certificates by default, or can an attacker perform man-in-the-middle attacks using self-signed or invalid certificates to serve malicious JWKs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [HTTP Redirect] Can an attacker control the OpenID provider to issue HTTP redirects that change HTTPS to HTTP or redirect to malicious domains, bypassing security checks through redirect chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Request Timeout] Is there a timeout configured for HTTP requests, or can a malicious OpenID provider hang connections indefinitely to cause denial of service on validator nodes fetching JWKs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Request Timeout] Can an attacker make the OpenID configuration endpoint hang indefinitely without timeout, preventing validators from obtaining JWKs and halting keyless account authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Response Size Limit] Is there a maximum response size limit, or can a malicious provider return gigabytes of data in the JWKs response causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [Response Size] Can an attacker provide an OpenID configuration response with extremely large JSON payloads that exhaust validator memory during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [HTTP Method] Does the function enforce GET requests only, or could request_builder be manipulated to send POST/PUT requests if the client implementation changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Cookie Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the my_addr parameter to inject malicious cookie values containing newlines (\\\\r\\\\n) or semicolons that enable HTTP header injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Cookie Format] Does AccountAddress::to_hex() produce output that could contain special characters or control bytes that break HTTP header parsing or enable cookie injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Privacy Leak] Does sending the validator's AccountAddress as a cookie to external OpenID providers leak sensitive validator identity information that could be used for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [Cookie Length] Can an attacker craft an AccountAddress that produces an extremely long hex string causing HTTP header size limits to be exceeded and request failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_from_jwks_uri()] [JSON Bomb] Can an attacker return deeply nested JSON structures in the keys array that cause stack overflow or excessive memory consumption during serde deserialization? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [JSON Missing Fields] Can an attacker return an OpenID configuration missing the jwks_uri field to cause deserialization errors that crash the validator or prevent JWK updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/jwk-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: fetch_jwks_uri_from_openid_config()] [JSON Type Mismatch] What happens if jwks_uri in OpenIDConfiguration is not a string but an object or array - does deserialization fail safely or cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
