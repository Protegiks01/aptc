  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker send a StreamStatus message with start_version set to u64::MAX, causing integer overflow when calculating batch ranges (start_version + transactions_count), potentially leading to version wraparound and transaction replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Version Consistency] Can a malicious fullnode send StreamStatus with end_version < start_version, causing negative ranges that could bypass version checks and allow serving of transactions out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Optional Field Attack] When end_version is None/unset in StreamStatus, does the receiving node properly handle the unbounded range, or can this be exploited to cause memory exhaustion by requesting infinite transaction history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [State Machine Violation] Can an attacker send multiple INIT StatusType messages in a single stream, resetting the start_version multiple times to cause confusion about which transactions were already delivered? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Batch Boundary Attack] Can a malicious node send BATCH_END with end_version that doesn't match the actual number of transactions sent in TransactionsOutput, causing version gaps or overlaps in the ledger? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Enum: StatusType] [Unspecified State] If StatusType is set to Unspecified (value 0), does the protocol handle this gracefully, or could this cause undefined behavior in state machine transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Version Gap Attack] Can an attacker send StreamStatus with start_version = 1000 and end_version = 2000, then next batch with start_version = 3000, creating a 1000-version gap that causes missing transactions in the ledger? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Version Overlap Attack] Can a malicious fullnode send overlapping version ranges (batch 1: versions 100-200, batch 2: versions 150-250), causing duplicate transaction processing and potential double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Arithmetic Overflow] In the formula 'version x + (k + 1) * n - 1' from the comments, can integer overflow occur with large k or n values, causing incorrect end_version calculation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: StreamStatus] [Zero Version Attack] Can start_version be set to 0 when the genesis version is actually 1 or higher, potentially allowing replay of genesis transactions or causing version inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Panic DoS] The comment states 'If not set will panic somewhere' for starting_version - can an attacker send requests with starting_version = None to trigger panics and crash fullnodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Resource Exhaustion] When transactions_count is None, the comment says 'response streams infinitely' - can this be exploited for memory/bandwidth exhaustion DoS attacks by opening many infinite streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Integer Overflow] Can transactions_count be set to u64::MAX, causing arithmetic overflow when computing end_version = starting_version + transactions_count? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Version Beyond Ledger] Can starting_version be set to a value far beyond the current ledger version (e.g., u64::MAX - 1), causing the node to wait indefinitely or allocate excessive resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Zero Count Attack] Can transactions_count be set to 0, causing confusion about whether any transactions should be returned or triggering edge cases in batch processing? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Historical Version Attack] Can an attacker request ancient versions (starting_version = 1) with huge transactions_count to force the node to process/stream pruned historical data, causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionsFromNodeRequest] [Version Rewind Attack] Can a client request starting_version that was already consumed in a previous stream session, potentially causing duplicate transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsFromNodeResponse] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can a malicious fullnode send responses with incorrect chain_id (e.g., mainnet chain_id when connected to testnet), causing cross-chain replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.internal.fullnode.v1.rs] [Struct: TransactionsFromNodeResponse] [Chain ID Validation] Is chain_id validated against the expected chain for the connection, or can arbitrary u32 values be accepted without verification? (High)",
