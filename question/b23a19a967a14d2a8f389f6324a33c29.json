  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious path containing '../../../' sequences that escape the intended package directory, allowing arbitrary file system access when reroot_path() calls canonicalize()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Symlink Attack] Does reroot_path() properly validate that the canonicalized path is not a symlink pointing outside the package root, allowing an attacker to redirect operations to sensitive system directories like /etc or /root? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between canonicalize() at line 20 and set_current_dir() at line 21, where an attacker could swap the directory with a malicious one via symlink race? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Panic-based DoS] Does the unwrap() at line 21 create a denial-of-service vector where an attacker provides a path with insufficient permissions, causing the CLI to panic instead of gracefully handling the error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Environment Pollution] Can an attacker exploit the global side-effect of set_current_dir() at line 21 to interfere with concurrent CLI operations running in the same process, causing file operations to target wrong directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Canonicalization Bypass] Does canonicalize() properly resolve all symbolic links and '..' components, or can an attacker craft paths using Windows-specific path traversal techniques (8.3 filenames, alternate data streams) to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Package Root Injection] Can try_find_root() at line 20 be fooled by placing a malicious Move.toml file in a parent directory, causing reroot_path() to root to an attacker-controlled location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Path Validation] Does reroot_path() validate that the resolved path is actually within a legitimate Move package structure, or can it be used to execute operations on arbitrary directories that happen to contain a Move.toml file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/mod.rs] [Function: reroot_path()] [Error Information Leak] When canonicalize() fails at line 20, does the error message leak sensitive file system information like absolute paths, user directories, or permission details that could aid reconnaissance? (Low)",
