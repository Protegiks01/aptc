  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Version consistency] If Vault returns a different version than what was stored in secret_versions, does the code detect this inconsistency or silently accept potentially tampered data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Write verification] After write_secret() returns new_version, does the code verify the write succeeded by reading back, or trust Vault's response that could be forged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Key integrity] Does get_public_key() verify the returned public key matches the expected key derivation from private key, or blindly trust Vault's response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Rotation verification] After trim_key_versions(), does rotate_key() verify the old versions were actually deleted, or assume success allowing continued use of compromised keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [Connection pooling] Does each VaultStorage instance create a new Client connection, potentially exhausting Vault's connection limit with multiple validator instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_kv()] [Resource exhaustion] Can list_secrets() return unbounded results that consume excessive memory when processing large Vault deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_crypto()] [Batch operations] Does reset_crypto() delete keys one-by-one, potentially taking excessive time and blocking other operations during cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: new()] [Token format validation] Is the token parameter validated for proper format/length, or can empty/malformed tokens cause authentication bypass or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: new()] [Host validation] Can malicious host URLs (e.g., with embedded credentials, path injection) bypass security checks or redirect Vault connections to attacker-controlled servers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: new()] [TTL bounds checking] Is renew_ttl_secs validated against reasonable bounds, or can extremely small/large values cause integer overflow in renewal calculations or constant renewal attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [use_cas default] Why isn't use_cas true by default? Does this mean most deployments don't use CAS protection, allowing concurrent update conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Renewal state machine] Can the token renewal state machine enter invalid states (e.g., next_renewal in the past but renewal failing) that prevent recovery without restart? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Partial failure] If write_secret() succeeds but secret_versions update fails, does this create inconsistent state where subsequent operations fail until restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Creation rollback] If create_ed25519_key() succeeds but get_public_key() fails, is the created key left dangling in Vault causing resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Slow path] Can an attacker cause get() to repeatedly hit slow paths (e.g., cache misses) by requesting uncommon keys, degrading validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Expensive operations] Can an attacker force validators to perform excessive signing operations by sending many signature requests, degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: client()] [Renewal storms] If multiple VaultStorage instances share similar renew_ttl_secs, can synchronized renewal attempts overwhelm Vault causing DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: key_version()] [Error messages] Do error messages from KeyVersionNotFound leak the list of available public keys or version numbers that could aid attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: available()] [Vault state] Does the unsealed() check reveal Vault's internal state that could help attackers time their attacks for when Vault is sealed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Timing attacks] Does the execution time of get() vary based on whether the key exists, allowing timing attacks to enumerate validator secrets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Audit logging] Are private key exports logged and monitored, or can attackers silently exfiltrate keys without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: get()] [Generic type confusion] Can type parameter T be manipulated to deserialize secrets as wrong types, causing type confusion vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Serialization type mismatch] If a secret is written with type T1 but read with type T2, does deserialization fail safely or cause memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign()] [Lifetime issues] Are the message references properly bounded to prevent use-after-free when signing references to temporary data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Struct: VaultStorage] [Send/Sync safety] Is VaultStorage properly Send+Sync for multi-threaded use, or can data races occur when shared across threads? (High)"
