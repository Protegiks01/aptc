  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transaction_range_proof()] [Proof Gap] Can the backup service return a proof that covers a range missing specific versions, allowing transaction omission to go undetected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_root_proof()] [Merkle Tree Depth] Can an attacker provide state root proofs with excessive depth, causing verification to consume excessive CPU time or stack space and crash validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_account_range_proof()] [Proof Size] Are there limits on the size of range proofs, or can an attacker cause the backup service to return gigabyte-sized proofs that exhaust memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transaction_range_proof()] [Invalid Range] If first_version == last_version, does this return a proof for a single transaction, empty proof, or cause an error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Struct: BackupServiceClient] [Shared Client] The reqwest::Client in line 36 is shared across all requests - can concurrent backup operations from multiple threads cause race conditions in connection pooling or response handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Concurrent Streams] Can multiple concurrent calls to get() methods receive interleaved bytes from each other's responses if the underlying HTTP client doesn't properly isolate streams? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_db_state()] [TOCTOU] Between calling get_db_state() and using the returned DbState, can the backup service's state change, causing subsequent backup operations to use stale or inconsistent metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Concurrent Chunks] If multiple threads fetch different chunks concurrently for the same version, can they receive chunks from inconsistent state snapshots due to backup service state changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Async Cancellation] If a backup task is cancelled (e.g., via tokio::select!), is the HTTP request properly aborted, or can it continue running and corrupt shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Connection Reuse] Does the reqwest client properly handle connection reuse, or can stale connections serve cached responses from previous requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [DNS Rebinding] Can an attacker exploit DNS rebinding to change what server the 'address' resolves to mid-backup, redirecting subsequent requests to a malicious server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: new()] [Address Validation] Is the address parameter validated to ensure it's a valid HTTP(S) URL, or can injection of other protocols (file://, ftp://) cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Connection Pooling] Does the HTTP client impose limits on concurrent connections, or can an attacker exhaust connection pools by making many simultaneous backup requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Keep-Alive] Are HTTP connections kept alive between requests - can this be exploited to maintain long-lived connections that bypass firewall timeout rules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Constant: TIMEOUT_SECS] [Hardcoded Timeout] The 60-second timeout in line 40 is hardcoded - can this be insufficient for large state snapshots, causing legitimate backup operations to fail and appear as attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: new_with_opt()] [Default Address] The default address 'localhost:6186' in line 27 - can misunderstanding of this default cause validators to accidentally expose backup services publicly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: new()] [No TLS] The client doesn't enforce HTTPS - can validators accidentally use unencrypted HTTP, exposing all backup data to network eavesdroppers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [No Retry Logic] There's no visible retry mechanism - can transient network failures cause backup operations to fail unnecessarily, or could retry logic be exploited for amplification attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Constant: TIMEOUT_SECS] [Timeout Tuning] Is 60 seconds appropriate for all backup operations, or can small operations like get_state_item_count() use a shorter timeout to reduce attack surface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Lifetime Elision] The return type 'impl AsyncRead + use<>' has an elided lifetime - can this cause dangling references if the BackupServiceClient is dropped while the reader is still in use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_db_state()] [Mutable Buffer] The Vec<u8> in line 88 is mutably borrowed - can race conditions occur if multiple threads try to read the same DbState simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on Build] The expect() in line 52 can panic - should this use a Result return type instead to allow graceful error handling during backup client initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Error Type Erasure] The err_notes() calls in lines 67 and 69 might erase error type information - can this hide important error details needed for security incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_item_count()] [Unchecked Cast] The 'as usize' cast in line 111 is unchecked - should this use try_into() to detect overflow on 32-bit platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Response Splitting] Can attackers inject headers or response splitting attacks through the URL or params to cause HTTP response smuggling? (Medium)"
