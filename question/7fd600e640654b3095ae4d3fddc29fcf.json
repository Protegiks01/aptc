  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Epoch attack] [Epoch boundary exploitation] Can attackers exploit the transition between end_epoch() and new_epoch() to submit transactions that are validated against old epoch rules? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Epoch attack] [Validator set continuity] Does new_epoch() verify continuity of validator sets across epochs, or can it accept arbitrary validator changes that violate staking rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Epoch attack] [Configuration divergence] Can different validators receive different parameters to new_epoch(), causing them to operate under inconsistent rules and fork the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_replication.rs] [Epoch attack] [Epoch number manipulation] Can the epoch number in EpochState be manipulated to skip epochs or repeat epoch numbers, confusing consensus protocols? (High)"
