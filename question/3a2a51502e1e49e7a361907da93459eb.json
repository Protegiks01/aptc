  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/vanishing_poly.rs] [Function: from_roots()] [Input ownership] The function takes `&[F]` by reference - can calling code mutate the roots during execution, causing race conditions or use-after-free in the recursive calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/vanishing_poly.rs] [Function: from_roots()] [Lifetime safety] Are the slice lifetimes at lines 23-24 correctly tracked, or can dangling references be created if the input array is deallocated during recursion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/vanishing_poly.rs] [Function: from_roots()] [Return value usage] Does calling code properly validate the returned polynomial, or can invalid polynomials (e.g., zero polynomial, wrong degree) propagate into cryptographic operations? (High)",
