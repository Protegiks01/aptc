  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [External Check Bypass] The execute() method calls build_with_external_checks with MoveLintChecks::make() - can an attacker prevent this external check from being registered or force it to use incorrect configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Message Leakage] Do error messages from get_package_path(), create_build_config(), or prepare_resolution_graph() expose sensitive file paths or system information that could aid in further attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Verbose Error Attack] Can an attacker trigger intentional lint failures to generate verbose error output containing private Move code, address mappings, or dependency information from other packages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: to_move_options()] [Clone Side Effects] The to_move_options() method uses self.clone() - are there any side effects or resource exhaustion issues if an attacker triggers repeated cloning with extremely large named_addresses maps or long experiment lists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Struct: LintPackage] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely large values for experiments vector, named_addresses map, or package_dir PathBuf that cause memory exhaustion during cloning or processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async Safety] The execute() method is async but performs synchronous blocking operations - can an attacker exploit this to cause thread pool starvation or deadlocks in the CLI runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Trait: CliCommand] [Command Injection] Can the command_name() return value be exploited if it's used in logging or shell commands elsewhere, potentially allowing command injection through the 'LintPackage' string? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resolution Graph Poisoning] Can an attacker craft a malicious Move.toml with circular dependencies, conflicting versions, or extremely deep dependency trees that cause prepare_resolution_graph() to hang or crash? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Git Dependency Hijacking] When skip_fetch_latest_git_deps is false, can an attacker perform a MITM attack or DNS poisoning to redirect git dependency fetches to malicious repositories containing backdoored Move code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Field: named_addresses] [Parser Exploit] Can the parse_map function used for named_addresses be exploited with malformed input (e.g., 'name=0xGGGG', 'name=overflow_address') to cause parser crashes or incorrect address parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Type: AccountAddressWrapper] [Wrapper Bypass] Does AccountAddressWrapper properly validate address format, or can an attacker provide addresses that bypass Move's address constraints but pass CLI parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Lint Check Downgrade] Can an attacker somehow prevent MoveLintChecks::make() from being invoked or cause it to initialize with an empty check list, effectively disabling all lint checks while claiming success? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: to_config()] [Config Override] Can the BTreeMap returned by to_config() be manipulated after creation but before use, allowing an attacker to override the 'checks' value with malicious configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Field: named_addresses] [Default Value Bypass] The default_value is empty string for named_addresses - can an attacker exploit this to cause the parser to accept malformed input that wouldn't be accepted with explicit values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Field: checks] [Default Lint Level] The checks field defaults to None which becomes Default via unwrap_or_default() - can an attacker rely on this to bypass stricter lint checks they should be using? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Comment: Line 45] [Duplicate Address Exploit] The comment warns 'This will fail if there are duplicates in the Move.toml file remove those first' - does this mean attackers can craft Move.toml files with duplicate named addresses that cause non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [TOML Injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious Move.toml with special characters, extremely long names, or nested structures that cause the package resolution to misbehave? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: to_move_options()] [Field Omission] The to_move_options() method explicitly omits the 'checks' field - can this omission cause state inconsistency if MovePackageOptions expects this field to be populated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Struct: MovePackageOptions] [Default Field Attack] The ..MovePackageOptions::new() pattern fills remaining fields with defaults - can an attacker exploit missing field initialization to cause incorrect lint behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Constant: IncludedArtifacts::Sparse] [Artifact Manipulation] The execute() hardcodes IncludedArtifacts::Sparse - can an attacker bypass this to force Full artifact generation, potentially exposing more compiled information than intended? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [Build Options Override] Can an attacker manipulate build_options_with_experiments() to override the Sparse artifact setting or inject additional unwanted build parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Vector: more_experiments] [Experiment Collision] The more_experiments vector adds LINT_CHECKS, SPEC_CHECK, etc. - can an attacker provide experiments that conflict with these hardcoded ones, causing undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [String Injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or control sequences into experiment strings that cause the compiler to misinterpret flags or enable unintended features? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Function: execute()] [False Success] The execute() method returns 'succeeded' even if lint checks found issues - can an attacker rely on this optimistic return to bypass CI/CD lint enforcement that only checks return status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/lint.rs] [Return Type: CliTypedResult] [Error Suppression] Does CliTypedResult properly propagate lint errors, or can serious lint failures be silently converted to success allowing vulnerable code to pass validation? (Medium)"
