  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/internals.rs] [Trait: ModuleIndex] [Eq Implementation] Indices derive Eq - does equality comparison ever substitute for validation, allowing two distinct invalid indices to be treated as equivalent and bypass duplicate detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/internals.rs] [Trait: ModuleIndex] [Display Format] Index Display implementation shows raw numeric values - can information leakage through error messages or logs expose table structure information aiding attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/internals.rs] [Trait: ModuleIndex] [No Lifetime] ModuleIndex has no lifetime parameters - can indices outlive their source module tables, becoming dangling references that access freed memory in parallel execution scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/internals.rs] [Trait: ModuleIndex] [Const Evaluation] IndexKind::KIND is a const - can attackers exploit compile-time vs runtime constant evaluation differences to cause KIND values to differ between verifier and executor stages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/internals.rs] [Trait: ModuleIndex] [Missing Safety] The trait has no unsafe methods but implementations perform casts - does this false sense of safety lead to missing validation in caller code that assumes all index operations are checked? (High)"
