  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: ConfigOptimizer::optimize()] [Partial Optimization] Does optimize() only handle enable_pre_commit but miss other validator-specific optimizations, allowing fullnodes to use validator-only features unsafely? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: is_consensus_only_perf_test_enabled()] [Compile-time vs Runtime] Does is_consensus_only_perf_test_enabled() only check compile-time features but miss runtime flags that could enable consensus-only testing in mainnet? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: QcAggregatorType] [Deprecated Type Attack] Can the deprecated QcAggregatorType enum still be exploited through deserialization of old configs to cause unexpected behavior or crashes in QC aggregation? (Medium)",

  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Field Interaction: timeouts] [Timeout Cascade] Can the interaction between mempool_executed_txn_timeout_ms, mempool_txn_pull_timeout_ms, quorum_store_pull_timeout_ms, and round timeouts create cascading timeout scenarios that halt consensus? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Field Interaction: block limits] [Limit Inconsistency] Can inconsistencies between max_sending_block_txns, max_sending_block_txns_after_filtering, max_sending_opt_block_txns_after_filtering create exploitable states where filtering allows oversized blocks? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Field Interaction: backpressure configs] [Conflicting Backpressure] Can execution_backpressure, pipeline_backpressure, and chain_health_backoff mechanisms conflict, causing some to activate while others don't, resulting in inconsistent block size enforcement?

(High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Serde: deny_unknown_fields] [Field Injection] Does the deny_unknown_fields attribute on ConsensusConfig properly prevent attackers from injecting extra fields through YAML/JSON deserialization that could affect consensus behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Serde: default] [Missing Field Attack] Can attackers exploit the #[serde(default)] attribute by omitting critical fields in config files, causing the system to use default values that may be insecure for certain deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Serde: nested structs] [Nested Validation Bypass] Can nested structs like ExecutionBackpressureConfig contain invalid values that pass serde deserialization but aren't validated by sanitize(), creating exploitable misconfigurations? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Arithmetic: MAX_RECEIVING_BLOCK_TXNS] [Overflow in Calculation] Can the calculation '10000.max(2 * MAX_SENDING_BLOCK_TXNS)' overflow if MAX_SENDING_BLOCK_TXNS is set to a very large value, causing unexpected small receive limits? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/consensus_config.rs] [Arithmetic: backoff calculations] [Exponential Overflow] Can the exponential backoff calculation using round_timeout_backoff_exponent_base ^ round_timeout_backoff_max_exponent overflow for certain base values, causing incorrect timeout values?
