(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Config: IndexerGrpcDataServiceConfig] [Read replica hijacking] Can an attacker modify the redis_read_replica_address to point to a server they control, serving stale or manipulated transaction data to API clients and causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Unicode normalization bypass] Can an attacker use Unicode lookalike characters in the scheme like 'ｒedis://' (fullwidth 'r') that might pass visual inspection but fail validation, or conversely, pass validation in normalized form but cause issues downstream? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Struct: RedisUrl] [Concurrent modification via Clone] Since RedisUrl derives Clone, can multiple threads hold mutable references to the inner Url after cloning, and could TOCTOU races allow validated URLs to be modified between validation and use? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/types.rs] [Struct: RedisUrl] [Serialization credential exposure] Does the Serialize implementation include credentials in the serialized output, and could serialized configs be inadvertently committed to version control, logs, or backups exposing Redis passwords?
