  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Field: block_info] [BlockInfo Hash Collision] Can an attacker find two different BlockInfo instances with the same ID (hash collision in CryptoHash), allowing them to substitute BlockInfo values in OrderVoteProposal while maintaining consistent IDs? (Critical - but requires breaking hash function)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Clone During Validation] If multiple threads clone the same OrderVoteProposal during validation, can race conditions in the shared Arc<QuorumCert> cause some threads to see verified signatures while others see unverified, leading to inconsistent validation results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Broadcast Race Condition] In round_manager.rs broadcast_order_vote() flow, can the OrderVoteProposal be modified between creation at line 1632 and broadcast at line 1681, causing different validators to receive different versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Field: quorum_cert] [Concurrent QC Verification] Can concurrent calls to verify_qc() on the same Arc<QuorumCert> cause race conditions in signature verification state (SignatureWithStatus interior mutability), leading to some validators accepting and others rejecting the same proposal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Struct: OrderVoteProposal] [Storage Race Condition] Can concurrent access to safety_data during observe_qc() and safe_for_order_vote() create race conditions where one_chain_round and highest_timeout_round are inconsistently updated, bypassing safety constraints?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Fields: block, block_info] [Author Mismatch] Can block.author() differ from the expected author based on block_info.round and the leader election algorithm, bypassing leader validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Fields: block, block_info] [Payload Hash Inconsistency] Does block_info implicitly commit to block's payload hash, or can the block payload be modified after block_info is created, allowing payload substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Fields: block, block_info] [Block Type Confusion] Can a NIL block be packaged with block_info for a normal block (or vice versa), causing type confusion in downstream processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Fields: block, block_info] [Execution Result Mismatch] Can block_info.executed_state_id and block_info.version represent execution results different from what executing the block would actually produce, enabling state commitment attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Field: quorum_cert] [Expired QC Reuse] Can a quorum_cert from an earlier epoch or round be reused in an OrderVoteProposal for a current block, bypassing epoch and round validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Field: quorum_cert] [QC Vote Data Mismatch] Can quorum_cert.vote_data() contain vote data for a different block than what's in the OrderVoteProposal, with the mismatch only detected in verify_order_vote_proposal()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Field: quorum_cert] [Parent Block Manipulation] Can quorum_cert.parent_block() be manipulated to point to a different parent than block.parent_id(), creating inconsistent parent relationships? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: observe_qc()] [One-Chain Round Regression] Can an OrderVoteProposal with a QC from a lower round than the current one_chain_round cause observe_qc() to fail to update safety_data, leading to stale safety constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote_proposal.rs] [Integration: observe_qc()] [Preferred Round Bypass] Can manipulating the quorum_cert to have a lower parent_block().round() bypass the preferred_round safety check, allowing votes on blocks that shouldn't be votable?
