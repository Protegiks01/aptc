  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/ledger_metadata_pruner.rs] [Rust: Arc<DB>] [Memory Leaks] If circular references exist between LedgerMetadataPruner and other components holding Arc<DB>, could this prevent DB from being dropped, causing memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/ledger_metadata_pruner.rs] [Testing: prune()] [Boundary Testing] Are there tests that verify prune() behavior when current_progress equals target_version, when target is less than current, and when range includes u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/ledger_metadata_pruner.rs] [Testing: new()] [Fallback Path] Is the fallback initialization logic at lines 25-36 covered by tests, or could bugs in this rarely-executed path go undetected until a validator encounters an old database? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/ledger_metadata_pruner.rs] [Testing: Error Cases] [Failure Scenarios] Are there tests that simulate database write failures, corrupted metadata, and recovery scenarios to ensure the pruner handles errors gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/ledger_metadata_pruner.rs] [Validation: Invariants] [State Invariants] Does the code enforce invariants like 'progress must never exceed ledger tip' or 'deleted versions must not be referenced elsewhere', or could these be violated in production? (Medium)"
