(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Race Condition] Can concurrent access to NUM_META_FILES from multiple threads during Lazy initialization create a race condition where the metric is initialized multiple times, leading to inconsistent metric registration or panic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Race Condition] Does the Lazy initialization of NUM_META_MISS provide proper synchronization guarantees when accessed concurrently by multiple backup operations, or can this lead to metric corruption?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Race Condition] Can race conditions during concurrent Lazy initialization of NUM_META_DOWNLOAD across multiple backup-cli instances sharing the same process space cause duplicate metric registration panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow by manipulating the remote backup storage to contain more than i64::MAX metadata files, causing NUM_META_FILES.set() to wrap around and report incorrect metrics that mask backup system compromise? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Integer Overflow] Can extremely large numbers of cache misses (approaching i64::MAX) cause NUM_META_MISS to overflow when set, leading to incorrect monitoring data that prevents detection of backup system attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Integer Overflow] Can repeated calls to NUM_META_DOWNLOAD.inc() during a long-running backup operation cause integer overflow past i64::MAX, wrapping to negative values and corrupting backup monitoring metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker with access to the backup storage system artificially inflate or deflate NUM_META_FILES by manipulating the remote file listing, causing backup operators to miss critical backup failures or compromise? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the local cache directory permissions or contents to artificially increase NUM_META_MISS, causing unnecessary bandwidth consumption and potentially triggering rate limits or DoS on backup storage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the fact that NUM_META_DOWNLOAD is only incremented on successful downloads to hide failed backup operations by causing downloads to fail silently, making metrics show false success? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Resource Leak] Does the Lazy<IntGauge> pattern properly handle cleanup when the backup-cli process terminates, or can abrupt termination leave orphaned metrics in the Prometheus registry causing memory leaks in long-running monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Resource Leak] Can repeated initialization and teardown of backup-cli processes cause NUM_META_MISS metric descriptors to accumulate in the global Prometheus registry without proper cleanup, leading to memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Resource Leak] Is there proper cleanup of NUM_META_DOWNLOAD when backup operations are cancelled or fail, or can this leave stale metrics that provide misleading information about backup health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Dependency: once_cell] [Supply Chain] Can vulnerabilities in the once_cell crate's Lazy implementation be exploited to bypass metric initialization guards, potentially allowing unauthorized metric registration or modification?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_FILES] [Name Collision] Can metric name collision with 'aptos_backup_metadata_num_files' from other backup-cli instances or components cause registration failures that halt backup operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Name Collision] Does the metric name 'aptos_backup_metadata_num_file_cache_misses' have proper namespacing to prevent collisions when multiple backup-cli instances run in the same process, potentially causing panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_DOWNLOAD] [Name Collision] Can the duplicate description text between NUM_META_MISS and NUM_META_DOWNLOAD (both say 'Number of metadata files to download due to non-existence in local cache') cause confusion in monitoring systems that index by description?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/metrics/metadata.rs] [Static: NUM_META_MISS] [Monitoring Bypass] Does NUM_META_MISS properly reset between backup runs, or can stale values from previous operations persist and cause false positives/negatives in backup health monitoring? (Low)",
