  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Maximum validators] What is the maximum size of contributors HashSet at line 19, and can an attacker cause HashSet operations to become O(n) instead of O(1) at scale? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Zero voting power] At line 79, can a validator with zero voting power due to slashing or removal still have Some() returned, allowing them to contribute transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/transcript_aggregation/mod.rs] [Function: add()] [Exact threshold] At line 132, if voting power exactly equals threshold, does power_check_result return Ok(), or is there an off-by-one error requiring strictly greater than? (High)"
