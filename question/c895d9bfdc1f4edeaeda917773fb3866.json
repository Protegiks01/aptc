  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] Does the public export of gas_profiling module expose internal benchmarking functions that could be misused in production environments to manipulate gas cost calculations or bypass gas metering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [API Surface] Is the gas_profiling module intended for test/benchmark use only, or could it be accidentally imported in production code leading to test harness functions being available in production builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Module Isolation] Does the public module export create any unintended dependencies where production code could depend on test infrastructure, potentially causing security issues if test code has relaxed security assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-benchmark/src/lib.rs] [Build Configuration] Are there proper feature flags or conditional compilation directives to ensure this benchmark module is excluded from production builds, preventing test code from being included in validator nodes? (Low)"
