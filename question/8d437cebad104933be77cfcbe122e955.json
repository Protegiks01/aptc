  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/state.rs] [Function: get_account_module()] [Empty module name] Can an empty module_name at line 105 bypass validation at line 111 and retrieve unintended default modules or system modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/state.rs] [Function: get_table_item()] [Empty table key] Does empty key in TableItemRequest at line 150 have defined behavior, or can it cause undefined behavior in table lookups, potentially accessing table metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/state.rs] [Function: table_item()] [Nil value type] Can value_type at line 396 be set to a nil/unit type to bypass deserialization and retrieve raw bytes of any table value regardless of actual type? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/state.rs] [Function: raw_table_item()] [Zero-length raw key] Does a zero-length key in RawTableItemRequest at line 200 have defined behavior, or can it access special table entries like headers or metadata? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/state.rs] [Function: raw_value()] [Direct StateKey access risk] Can get_raw_state_value() enable direct access to internal state keys that should only be accessible through higher-level abstractions, breaking encapsulation? (High)",
