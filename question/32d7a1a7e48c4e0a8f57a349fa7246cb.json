  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Async deadlock] Could circular dependencies between send operations on transport_notifs_tx and receive operations on transport_reqs_rx create deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Async resource cleanup] If an async task holding a connection is dropped before completion, are socket resources and file descriptors properly released? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent access to self.time_service across multiple async tasks cause data races or inconsistent time readings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Memory leak] If upgrade futures are pushed to FuturesUnordered but never polled to completion, do they accumulate indefinitely causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Connection leak] If send_connection_to_peer_manager() fails to send a connection, is the TSocket properly closed or does it leak file descriptors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Channel buffer exhaustion] If transport_notifs_tx has a bounded buffer, what happens when it fills up - do sends block, fail, or panic, potentially causing DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Box allocation] Are boxed futures in upgrade_inbound_connection and dial_peer properly deallocated if the future is cancelled or dropped early? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Metadata ownership] Is connection.metadata cloned unnecessarily (line 339), and could large metadata structures cause excessive memory usage or cloning overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Listener resource] If the transport.listen_on() listener at line 68-70 fails to close properly when TransportHandler is dropped, could this leak listening sockets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [FuturesUnordered capacity] Do pending_inbound_connections and pending_outbound_connections have implicit capacity limits, or can they grow to arbitrary size? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Error propagation] When upgrade futures return Err, is sufficient context preserved to diagnose whether the failure was due to network issues, cryptographic failures, or malicious behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Panic handling] If transport.listen_on() panics at line 70, does this crash the entire validator node, causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Response channel dropped] If the receiver of response_tx (in dial_peer) is dropped before the response is sent, does send() return an error that's properly handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Listener termination] When the listener stream ends at line 107, does the select! macro handle this gracefully or could it cause the listen loop to spin indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Partial upgrade] If a connection upgrade completes partially (e.g., handshake succeeds but socket fails), is the partial state properly cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [None propagation] When upgrade_inbound_connection or dial_peer return None, are associated resources cleaned up, or do they leak until garbage collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Error logging side effects] Could the error logs at lines 160, 206, 260, 311, 358 trigger rate limiting or alerting storms during an attack, masking the actual attack pattern? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Handshake timeout] Are the upgrade futures created by transport.dial() and listener connections subject to timeouts, or can a malicious peer stall handshakes indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Connection origin confusion] Can an attacker exploit differences between Inbound and Outbound connection handling to bypass security checks by choosing their connection direction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Transport layer bypass] Does the TTransport generic allow implementations that bypass security checks, enabling connections without proper authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [NetworkAddress validation] Are NetworkAddress values validated for correct format and reachability before use, or can malformed addresses cause parsing errors or crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [PeerId binding] Is there a check to ensure that the same PeerId doesn't have multiple simultaneous connections (both inbound and outbound), potentially enabling cloning attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Connection metadata trust] Is the connection.metadata (line 339) returned by the transport layer trusted, or should it be re-validated to prevent metadata spoofing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Transport downgrade] Can an attacker force downgrade of the TTransport to a less secure variant (e.g., from encrypted to plaintext) by manipulating the upgrade process? (Critical)",
