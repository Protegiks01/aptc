  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MAXIMUM_MUTATE_EVENT_TYPE] [Type args bypass] The type_args vec is empty - can this be exploited to create generic versions of the event with different type parameters that bypass type safety checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Event emission] [Replay attack] Does the event structure contain any sequence number or timestamp to prevent replay attacks where old CollectionMaximumMutateEvent instances are re-emitted to confuse indexers about current collection state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Event ordering] [State inconsistency] Without ordering guarantees, can concurrent maximum mutations cause events to be processed out-of-order, resulting in indexers recording incorrect mutation history (e.g., old_maximum doesn't match previous new_maximum)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Event validation] [Missing constraints] Since there's no validation that old_maximum matches the actual on-chain collection maximum before mutation, can attackers emit fake events with arbitrary old_maximum values to rewrite collection history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Event authentication] [Authorization bypass] Does event emission require cryptographic proof that the creator_addr matches the actual collection creator, or can any account emit CollectionMaximumMutateEvent for collections they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Cross-module] [Event spoofing] Can malicious Move modules import this event type and emit fake CollectionMaximumMutateEvent instances for other creators' collections, poisoning the event stream with fraudulent mutation records? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Integration] [Type safety bypass] When other modules deserialize events using try_from_bytes(), can type confusion allow CollectionMaximumMutateEvent to be interpreted as a different event type with overlapping field layouts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Module interaction] [Reentrancy] If event emission happens within a Move transaction that later reverts, are emitted events rolled back, or can attackers use transaction reversion to probe for valid collection names without committing mutations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Non-determinism] Does the derived Serialize implementation produce deterministic BCS output across different Rust compiler versions, or can serialization differences cause event hash mismatches breaking Merkle proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Field ordering] Can changes to struct field ordering in future versions break serialization compatibility, causing historical events to become undeserializable and losing collection mutation history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Backward compatibility] If new fields are added to CollectionMaximumMutateEvent, will try_from_bytes() reject old events, or can missing fields cause partial deserialization with default values that misrepresent historical mutations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Supply manipulation] Can attackers emit events claiming to increase new_maximum to u64::MAX, causing indexers to display inflated collection supply caps that mislead investors and manipulate NFT prices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Scarcity exploit] By emitting events with decreasing new_maximum values (even if invalid), can attackers create artificial scarcity perception that pumps collection floor prices before dumping holdings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Economic] [Front-running] Can validators observe pending collection maximum mutations in mempool and front-run them by buying undervalued NFTs before scarcity increases, exploiting information asymmetry? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Storage] [Bloat attack] Can attackers spam thousands of maximum mutation events (by repeatedly flipping between two values) to bloat event logs and increase indexer storage costs to unsustainable levels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Performance] [Query DoS] Can extremely long collection_name strings cause O(n) string comparison operations in indexer queries to degrade performance when searching for specific collection events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Indexing] [Collision attack] Can attackers create collections with names designed to cause hash collisions in indexer databases, causing event misattribution or query result corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Type system] [Generic bypass] Since CollectionMaximumMutateEvent implements MoveEventV1Type without type parameters, can attackers exploit this to emit events in generic contexts where type checking should enforce specific event types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Type conversion] [Unsafe cast] Can unsafe Rust code cast CollectionMaximumMutateEvent pointers to other event types with similar memory layouts, bypassing type safety and corrupting event processing pipelines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Authorization] [Creator validation] Since creator_addr is just a field without cryptographic binding, can attackers emit events claiming to be from high-value collection creators to pump prices of copycat collections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Authorization] [System address exploit] Can events be emitted with creator_addr set to system addresses (0x1, 0x3, etc.) to make fake mutations appear system-authorized and bypass frontend security warnings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Consistency] [Atomicity violation] If multiple CollectionMaximumMutateEvent emissions happen in parallel for the same collection, can non-atomic event processing cause indexers to record inconsistent mutation sequences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Consistency] [Invariant violation] Can events be emitted where new_maximum < current_supply, creating impossible states where more tokens exist than the collection's claimed maximum capacity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Consistency] [Orphaned events] If the corresponding collection is deleted from state but events remain in logs, can orphaned CollectionMaximumMutateEvent instances cause indexers to track non-existent collections indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_maximum_mutate_event.rs] [Cryptography] [Event authentication] Does the event structure include any cryptographic signature from the creator_addr to prove ownership, or can anyone emit events for any creator address? (Critical)"
