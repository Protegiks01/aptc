  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: native_move_range()] [Reentrancy] If vector elements contain callback references or are stored in global storage that triggers other code during move_range, could reentrancy cause vectors to be modified mid-operation, leading to use-after-free or double-free bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Native registration] The make_all function at lines 110-116 registers the native function. If this registration process fails or is called multiple times, could duplicate registrations cause move_range to be called with wrong contexts or type arguments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Name collision] The native is registered as \\",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Builder safety] The SafeNativeBuilder::make_named_natives at line 115 is trusted to correctly associate names with function pointers. If this builder has bugs, could it associate move_range with a different function, allowing arbitrary native code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: native_move_range()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a transaction with extremely large removal_position, length, and insert_position values that pass all checks at lines 70-78 but cause VectorRef::move_range to allocate excessive memory, crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: native_move_range()] [Timing attack] Do the error paths at lines 48-50, 75-77, and 89-91 take different amounts of time, allowing timing attacks to leak information about vector sizes or feature flag status? While not directly exploitable, could this enable side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/vector.rs] [Function: native_move_range()] [Version compatibility] If the Move VM is upgraded but this native function isn't recompiled, could ABI incompatibilities between the old native and new VM cause crashes, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities? (High)"
