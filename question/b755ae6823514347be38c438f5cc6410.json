  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas_inner()] [Write Ordering] Can concurrent write_schemas_inner() calls from different threads result in non-deterministic write ordering, violating the assumption that batch order matches operation order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: new_native_batch()] [Batch Lifetime] Can NativeBatch lifetime issues cause use-after-free if the DB is dropped while batches are still being constructed, potentially corrupting memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Read-Write Race] Can reads via get() observe torn writes from concurrent put() operations, violating linearizability and causing validators to see inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: Drop for DB] [Drop Race Condition] Can the Drop implementation race with ongoing operations, causing use-after-free when other threads still hold references to column family handles? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Memory Leak] Does get() properly handle decode_value() failures to prevent memory leaks when processing large values that fail deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas_inner()] [Batch Memory Growth] Can accumulated batches in write_schemas_inner() grow unbounded before commit, causing OOM conditions on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: open_cf_impl()] [CF Handle Leak] Can failures during column family opening cause resource leaks where RocksDB column family handles are not properly released? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: iter()] [Iterator Memory] Can long-lived iterators pin old versions of data in RocksDB, preventing garbage collection and causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Metric Label Injection] Can schema-controlled COLUMN_FAMILY_NAME values inject malicious Prometheus metric labels, exploiting metric aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas_inner()] [Timer Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate operation timing to skew APTOS_SCHEMADB_BATCH_COMMIT_LATENCY_SECONDS metrics, hiding performance degradation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Byte Counter Overflow] Can APTOS_SCHEMADB_GET_BYTES.observe_with() accumulate to overflow float64 precision, causing incorrect metric reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas()] [Partial Write] If sync_write_option() fails midway through a multi-CF batch, can this cause state inconsistency where some column families are updated but others are not? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Stale Read] Can get() return stale data from before a recent write_schemas() commit, violating read-after-write consistency required for transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: open_cf_impl()] [CF Mismatch] If the requested column families don't match existing CFs, can opening succeed with partial CF set, causing reads to fail unpredictably during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas_relaxed()] [Durability Violation] Does write_schemas_relaxed() document the durability guarantees, or can developers mistakenly use it for critical consensus state, risking data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: get()] [Schema Version Mismatch] If a schema's Key or Value type changes between versions, can old data be decoded with new schema causing type confusion or data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: put()] [Schema Constraint Violation] Does put() validate that encoded keys and values meet schema constraints (like key uniqueness, value size limits) before writing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: delete()] [Cascade Delete] When deleting a key, are dependent keys in other column families properly deleted to maintain referential integrity across schemas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_write_option()] [WAL Manipulation] Does the sync write option properly configure RocksDB's Write-Ahead Log to prevent attackers from corrupting the WAL and causing data loss on recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: open_impl()] [Compression Configuration] Can the hardcoded Lz4 compression be bypassed or reconfigured to use weaker compression, enabling compression oracle attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: open_cf_impl()] [Background Thread DoS] Can RocksDB background threads (compaction, flush) be exhausted through crafted write patterns, degrading consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: open_cf_impl()] [Corrupted DB Recovery] Does the code properly detect and refuse to open corrupted databases, or can corrupted RocksDB instances be opened and corrupt validator state further? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/lib.rs] [Function: write_schemas()] [Crash During Write] If the process crashes during write_schemas() after sync but before stats.commit(), can this cause metric inconsistency or state machine issues? (Medium)",
