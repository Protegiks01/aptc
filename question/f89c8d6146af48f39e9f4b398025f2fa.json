  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Concurrent sync race] Can multiple calls to sync_to_target() execute concurrently despite the write_mutex, if one releases the lock before updating logical time and another acquires it? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Epoch state validation] Does new_epoch() validate that epoch_state represents a valid, consecutive epoch, or could attackers inject epoch states with arbitrary validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Validator list manipulation] Can the validator list extracted from epoch_state.verifier be tampered with to include unauthorized addresses or exclude legitimate validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Empty validator set] Does new_epoch() check that get_ordered_account_addresses_iter() returns a non-empty validator list, or could an empty set cause consensus to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Duplicate validators] Are duplicate validator addresses checked for and rejected, or could the validator list contain duplicates that cause quorum calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Payload manager replacement] Can malicious code replace payload_manager with a compromised implementation during new_epoch() that injects invalid payloads into consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Transaction shuffler attack] Could a malicious transaction_shuffler reorder transactions to enable front-running or other MEV attacks that violate fairness guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Config rollback] Can block_executor_onchain_config be set to an older configuration version to reintroduce patched vulnerabilities or incompatible execution parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Deduper disable] Could transaction_deduper be set to a no-op implementation that allows duplicate transaction execution, enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Randomness flag inconsistency] If randomness_enabled is set differently across validators, would they execute blocks with different randomness semantics, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Consensus config tampering] Can consensus_onchain_config be modified to change critical consensus parameters like timeout values or quorum thresholds mid-epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Version downgrade] Could persisted_auxiliary_info_version be set to 0 or an invalid version causing auxiliary data to be ignored or misinterpreted? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Network sender injection] Can network_sender be replaced with a malicious implementation that drops or modifies consensus messages, disrupting protocol operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [State write race] Is the self.state.write() operation atomic with respect to concurrent reads in pipeline_builder() and sync_to_target(), or could races cause partial state updates? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Missing synchronization] Does new_epoch() need to acquire write_mutex to prevent race conditions with sync_for_duration() and sync_to_target() that also modify logical state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Validator ordering] Is the ordering from get_ordered_account_addresses_iter() deterministic and consistent across all validators, or could ordering differences cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new_epoch()] [Memory exhaustion] Could the validators Arc be created with an excessively large validator set to cause memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [State clear race] Can end_epoch() clear the state while pipeline_builder() or sync_to_target() are reading it, causing panics or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Missing synchronization] Should end_epoch() acquire write_mutex to prevent concurrent state synchronization operations from accessing stale epoch state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Premature clearing] Can end_epoch() be called while consensus is still processing blocks for the current epoch, causing operations to fail with 'must be set within an epoch' panics? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Cleanup incomplete] Does end_epoch() properly clean up all epoch-specific resources, or could lingering references cause memory leaks or use of stale data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: end_epoch()] [Logical time reset] Should end_epoch() also reset or validate the logical time in write_mutex to prevent stale time being used in the next epoch? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function race] Can sync_for_duration() and sync_to_target() be called concurrently from different threads, and do they properly serialize through write_mutex to prevent state corruption? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Cross-function race] Can end_epoch() be called while sync operations are in progress, causing sync to fail or operate on cleared state? (High)"
