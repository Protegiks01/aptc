  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [Multiple discovery race] Can multiple discovery methods (Onchain + File + REST) create race conditions where conflicting peer sets are applied, causing inconsistent connectivity state across validators? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [Discovery interval manipulation] Can interval_secs for File/REST discovery be set to 0 or MAX_VALUE, either causing CPU exhaustion from constant polling or preventing peer set updates indefinitely? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Struct: NetworkBuilder] [Optional builder race] Can connectivity_manager_builder being Option<T> cause race conditions where Some() check passes but value is taken between check and use? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Uninitialized connectivity manager] If connectivity_manager_builder is None when start() is called, is this properly handled or will the code silently skip starting critical network components? (High)",
