  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Validation] [Native Signature] Does the native function table validate that all registered natives have compatible signatures with the Move VM's expectations, or can signature mismatches cause crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Cryptography] [Key Generation] Even though test key generation natives are checked, can production natives be called with test-like parameters (weak randomness, small key sizes) that create vulnerable keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Cryptography] [Signature Validation] Do production signature validation natives properly verify signatures from all supported schemes, or can signature malleability or weak curves in test contexts inform attacks on production signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Randomness] [mark_unbiasable()] Does marking randomness as unbiasable in tests properly simulate production randomness behavior, or can deterministic test randomness hide timing-based attacks or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Storage] [State Access] Can the pattern of returning None for all storage reads in tests mask critical state validation bugs, such as failing to check for resource existence before operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Storage] [Delayed Fields] Does the unreachable!() behavior for delayed field operations prevent proper testing of delayed field edge cases, potentially hiding bugs in production delayed field handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Storage] [Aggregator Overflow] Can the Ok(None) return for aggregator state reads allow tests to bypass overflow checks, potentially hiding integer overflow vulnerabilities in production aggregator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Storage] [Table Handles] Does returning None for all table entries prevent proper testing of table collision scenarios, key encoding bugs, or table deletion vulnerabilities? (Medium)"
