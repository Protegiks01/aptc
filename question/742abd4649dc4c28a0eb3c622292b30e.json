  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Type Alias: AccountChangeSet] [Backward Compatibility] At line 261, AccountChangeSet is defined as AccountChanges<Bytes> - if legacy code expects different generics, can type confusion lead to security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Type Alias: ChangeSet] [Type Confusion] At line 262, ChangeSet is defined as Changes<Bytes> - can malicious code construct Changes<T> with T != Bytes and cast it to ChangeSet causing type safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Type Alias: Bytes] [Serialization] Since AccountChangeSet and ChangeSet use Bytes as the resource type, are there proper deserialization checks to prevent malicious byte sequences from being interpreted as valid resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [BTreeMap Usage] [Hash Collision DoS] At line 73 and 176, BTreeMaps are used with StructTag and AccountAddress as keys - can attackers craft malicious keys that cause worst-case O(n) lookup times, degrading performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [BTreeMap Usage] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker fill the BTreeMaps with millions of entries to exhaust node memory, causing out-of-memory crashes during transaction execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [BTreeMap Usage] [Iterator Invalidation] When iterating over BTreeMaps at line 248-254, if the map is concurrently modified, can this cause iterator invalidation and undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [BTreeMap Entry API] [TOCTOU] At lines 100, 140, and 192, the Entry API is used with match statements - can time-of-check-time-of-use races occur if the map is accessed concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Resource Safety] [Double Move] When Op::ok() at line 64 extracts data from New or Modify, can the same data be extracted multiple times, violating Move's linear type system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Resource Safety] [Resource Leak] If a New operation fails to be applied and is not cleaned up, can the resource be permanently leaked, violating Move's resource safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Resource Safety] [Unauthorized Copy] Does the Clone derivation at line 11 for Op<T> properly enforce Move's resource rules, or can cloning allow unauthorized duplication of unique resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Resource Safety] [Delete Validation] When a Delete operation is applied at line 18, are there checks to ensure the resource being deleted actually exists and the caller has permission to delete it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/effects.rs] [Resource Safety] [Type Constraints] Are there trait bounds or type constraints ensuring that the generic Resource type at lines 72 and 175 actually represents valid Move resources and not arbitrary data? (High)",
