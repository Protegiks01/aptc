  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: Trace::from_recorder()] [Ownership Transfer] The function takes owned values. Can incorrect ownership transfer cause double-free or memory leaks if error handling is improper? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_entrypoint()] [Function Cloning Cost] LoadedFunction is cloned for every entrypoint. If a transaction has multiple entrypoints (is this possible?), can the cumulative cloning cost be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: TraceCursor::consume_entrypoint()] [Lifetime Constraints] The function returns a reference with lifetime tied to the cursor. Can lifetime extension attacks cause the reference to outlive the cursor and access freed memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_successful_instruction()] [Gas-Free Recording] Recording operations are not explicitly gas-metered. Can an attacker craft transactions that maximize recording costs (large traces) while minimizing gas payment, causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Trace Size Limits] There are no apparent size limits on traces. Can an attacker create arbitrarily large traces that exceed storage limits, causing validators to run out of disk space? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_call_closure()] [Per-Call Cost] Each closure call adds to the trace. Can a transaction with thousands of closure calls create a trace so large it's impractical to store or transmit? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: TraceCursor::consume_instruction_unchecked()] [Replay Cost] Replaying instructions has a cost. Can replay be more expensive than initial execution, causing validators to spend excessive resources on replay validation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: BytecodeFingerprintRecorder::record()] [Hashing Cost] Each instruction incurs a hash computation. For transactions with millions of instructions, can the cumulative hashing cost exceed gas limits? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/mod.rs] [Re-exports] [Symbol Visibility] The module re-exports TraceRecorder, FullTraceRecorder, NoOpTraceRecorder. Can external modules bypass intended access controls by directly importing from submodules instead of the main module? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/mod.rs] [Module Structure] [Public/Private Boundaries] TraceCursor is pub(crate) but Trace is pub. Can external code create traces without going through proper recording, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Trait: TraceRecorder] [Implementation Substitution] External code can implement TraceRecorder. Can a malicious implementation of this trait be substituted to bypass trace recording or inject false traces? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Public Construction] While Trace has private fields, can external code use mem::transmute or other unsafe operations to construct traces with invalid internal state? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Struct: FullTraceRecorder] [Mutable Access] The recorder is passed as &mut to recording functions. Can external code obtain multiple mutable references and cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: TraceCursor] [Replay Divergence] If the VM's instruction execution behavior has subtle differences between recording and replay (e.g., due to compiler optimizations), can this cause replay to fail even with valid traces? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: TraceCursor::consume_branch()] [Branch Prediction] If the VM uses branch prediction or speculative execution during replay, can incorrect predictions based on trace data leak information via side channels? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_branch_outcome()] [Branch Coverage] Not all code paths may execute branches. Can unreachable branches be recorded, and if so, can this be exploited to create impossible execution traces? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: TraceCursor::consume_closure_call()] [Closure Environment] The closure's captured environment is not part of the trace. Can differences in captured variables between recording and replay cause divergent execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_call_closure()] [Closure Identity] Only the function and mask are recorded, not the full closure environment. Can two closures with the same function but different captured variables be confused during replay? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::record_entrypoint()] [Transaction Boundaries] Is one trace per transaction, or can a single trace span multiple transactions? If the latter, can transaction boundary confusion cause state to leak between transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Struct: Trace] [Trace Reuse] Can a trace be replayed multiple times? If so, can this violate transaction uniqueness guarantees or cause replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Function: FullTraceRecorder::finish()] [Finalization Timing] When is finish() called? If called before transaction completion, can partial traces be leaked or misused? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/trace.rs] [Function: TraceCursor::is_done()] [Completion Semantics] What happens after is_done() returns true? Can the cursor be used again, and if so, what's the security impact? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/execution_tracing/recorders.rs] [Struct: FullTraceRecorder] [Recorder Lifecycle] Can a single recorder be reused across multiple transactions? If so, can residual state from one transaction leak into another? (High)"
