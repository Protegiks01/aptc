  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: EncryptionKey] [Quantum vulnerability] Since BIBE is based on bilinear pairings which are vulnerable to quantum computers, is there any post-quantum migration path, or will quantum computers break all historical encrypted data? (Medium - long term)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: AugmentedEncryptionKey] [Cryptographic agility] Can the key structures be upgraded to post-quantum algorithms without breaking existing encrypted data or requiring a hard fork? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: verify_decryption_key()] [Error message leakage] Do error messages from failed verification leak information about why verification failed (e.g., which point was invalid), enabling oracle attacks to gradually construct valid keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: EncryptionKey::new()] [Zero value handling] What happens if sig_mpk_g2 or tau_g2 are zero/identity elements, and does this enable trivial forgery attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: AugmentedEncryptionKey::new()] [Duplicate parameter detection] Does the constructor detect and reject cases where sig_mpk_g2 == tau_g2 == tau_mpk_g2, which might indicate setup errors or attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: EncryptionKey] [Negative test coverage] Are there comprehensive negative tests ensuring invalid keys are rejected, or can untested edge cases enable bypass attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: verify_decryption_key()] [Verification DoS] Can an attacker flood validators with verification requests for invalid decryption keys, causing excessive CPU usage in expensive pairing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: EncryptionKey::new()] [Construction DoS] Is there rate limiting on encryption key construction, or can an attacker create massive numbers of keys to exhaust memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone bomb] Can an attacker trigger deep recursive cloning of EncryptionKey structures to cause stack overflow or excessive memory allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Comparison DoS] Are equality comparisons constant-time and bounded, or can an attacker craft keys that take excessive time to compare, enabling DoS through comparison operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: EncryptionKey] [Consensus on key validity] Do all validators agree on whether a given EncryptionKey is valid, or can non-deterministic validation lead to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: AugmentedEncryptionKey] [Key distribution] How are encryption keys distributed to validators, and can an attacker intercept or modify keys during distribution to compromise the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Function: verify_decryption_key()] [Verification in consensus] If decryption key verification happens during consensus, can verification failures cause validators to disagree on block validity, leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/encryption_key.rs] [Struct: EncryptionKey] [State storage] Are encryption keys properly committed to blockchain state, or can an attacker exploit inconsistencies between keys used and keys stored? (High)"
