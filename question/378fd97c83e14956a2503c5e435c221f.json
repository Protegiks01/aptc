Can timing variations leak information about min_readable_version to observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_merkle_pruner/state_merkle_pruner_manager.rs] [Function: is_pruning_pending()] [State disclosure] At lines 86-90, this reveals whether pruning is currently active. Can this information be used by attackers to time attacks when the system is under pruning load? (Low)",

Can attackers use this to calculate exactly when historical state will be pruned and time attacks accordingly? (Low)",

Can attackers use this to identify validators with pruning disabled and target them for resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)"
