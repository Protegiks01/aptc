  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a malicious shard_id that exceeds num_shards, causing out-of-bounds access or incorrect shard routing that leads to transaction misexecution and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] If num_shards is set to usize::MAX or an extremely large value, can this cause integer overflow in subsequent calculations or memory allocation failures that crash the executor service? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker exploit num_threads parameter by setting it to an extremely large value, causing the executor to spawn excessive threads and exhaust system resources, leading to validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Binding] Does the NetworkController properly validate self_address to prevent binding to privileged ports or addresses that could enable network-level attacks or service impersonation? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Address Spoofing] Can a malicious actor provide a fake coordinator_address that redirects execution results to an attacker-controlled coordinator, enabling state manipulation or transaction censorship? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard Confusion] Can remote_shard_addresses contain duplicate addresses or self-address, causing the executor to communicate with itself and create circular message loops that halt execution? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory Safety] Does the Arc wrapping of RemoteCoordinatorClient and RemoteCrossShardClient properly prevent use-after-free if one component drops before others, potentially causing crashes during execution? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Timeout] Is the hardcoded 5000 timeout in NetworkController::new vulnerable to timing attacks where an attacker can craft messages that arrive just before timeout, causing inconsistent processing across shards? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel Security] Do the channels created in RemoteCoordinatorClient and RemoteCrossShardClient have bounded capacity, or can an attacker flood them with messages causing unbounded memory growth and OOM crashes? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Service Name Collision] Can multiple ExecutorService instances with the same shard_id be created, causing service name collisions in NetworkController that lead to message routing errors and execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Race Condition] Can start() be called multiple times concurrently, spawning duplicate execution threads that process the same commands simultaneously and produce conflicting state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Thread Panic] If the spawned thread panics during executor_service_clone.start(), is the panic properly handled or does it silently fail, leaving the shard offline while the coordinator believes it's running? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Controller State] Does calling controller.start() before the executor thread is ready create a race condition where incoming messages are processed before the executor service is initialized, causing crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Thread Name Collision] Can multiple shards with the same shard_id create thread name collisions that interfere with thread management or monitoring systems, masking failures in production? (Low)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Expect Panic] Does the .expect() on thread spawn failure provide sufficient error handling, or can spawn failures silently disable a shard without triggering alerts or fallback mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Arc Clone Safety] When executor_service_clone is moved into the spawned thread, are all necessary synchronization primitives in place to prevent data races when the main thread and spawned thread access shared state? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: start()] [Shutdown Coordination] If shutdown() is called immediately after start(), is there a race condition where the controller stops but the executor thread continues processing, leading to message delivery failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Incomplete Shutdown] Does shutdown() only stop the controller but leave the executor service thread running, causing orphaned threads that continue processing transactions with a stopped network layer? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Graceful Termination] Can shutdown() be called while transactions are mid-execution, causing partial state commits that violate atomicity guarantees and corrupt the blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Resource Leaks] Does shutdown() properly clean up all network connections, channels, and thread handles, or can repeated start/shutdown cycles leak resources leading to eventual system failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Double Shutdown] Can shutdown() be called multiple times, causing double-free or use-after-free errors in the NetworkController that lead to crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Message Loss] When shutdown() stops the controller, are in-flight messages from other shards or the coordinator properly handled or are they dropped, causing inconsistent execution results across shards? (High)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Shard Isolation] Can a malicious shard exploit the RemoteCrossShardClient to send crafted messages that appear to come from other shards, bypassing shard isolation and manipulating cross-shard state dependencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Message Ordering] Does the executor service guarantee message ordering between shards, or can an attacker exploit reordering to violate transaction dependencies and cause incorrect execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: execution/executor-service/src/remote_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ExecutorService] [Byzantine Shard] If one shard is Byzantine (<1/3 assumption), can it send conflicting cross-shard messages to different shards causing them to compute different state roots and fork the blockchain?
