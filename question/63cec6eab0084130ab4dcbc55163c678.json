  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Integrity: Checksum] Does EventSequenceNumberSchema use RocksDB's block checksums, or can silent data corruption cause sequence numbers to drift without detection, violating event ordering invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Integrity: Atomic writes] Are EventSequenceNumberSchema writes atomic with TranslatedV1EventSchema writes, or can crashes between these writes cause events to exist without corresponding sequence number updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Integrity: Sequence monotonicity] Does the system enforce that sequence numbers strictly increase, or can out-of-order batch processing cause newer events to have lower sequence numbers than older events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Integrity: Cross-schema consistency] Can EventSequenceNumberSchema and EventByKeySchema become inconsistent (e.g., 100 events stored but sequence counter shows 95), breaking event queries by sequence number? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [CF: EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME] [Merge operator] Does EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME use a RocksDB merge operator to atomically increment sequence numbers, or are increments done via read-modify-write causing race conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [CF: EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME] [Compaction priority] Is EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME configured with appropriate compaction priority, or can low priority cause sequence number reads to span many LSM levels, degrading query performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [CF: EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME] [Block cache] Is EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME included in RocksDB's block cache, or can frequent sequence number queries thrash the cache, evicting more important data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [CF: internal_indexer_column_families] [CF ordering] EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_CF_NAME is the last CF in internal_indexer_column_families(). Can CF creation order affect crash recovery, causing sequence numbers to be lost if recovery stops early? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Test: test_encode_decode] [Proptest coverage] The proptest only validates round-trip encoding with random EventKeys and u64s. Does it test edge cases like u64::MAX, zero sequence, or maximum-size EventKeys that could expose encoding bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Test: test_no_panic_decoding] [Fuzzing depth] Does test_no_panic_decoding use sufficient fuzzing iterations to catch rare deserialization panics caused by specific byte patterns in corrupted database data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Test coverage] Are there integration tests validating that concurrent event translation correctly updates EventSequenceNumberSchema without race conditions or sequence number collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [V2 translation: sequence assignment] When translating V2 events that don't have explicit sequence numbers to V1 events that require them, can the assignment logic in get_next_sequence_number() produce duplicate sequences if the EventHandle.count is stale? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [V2 translation: resource lookup] If get_state_value_bytes_for_resource() fails to find a resource (e.g., CoinStore), translation skips updating EventSequenceNumberSchema. Can this cause permanent sequence gaps that break event queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [V2 translation: hardcoded creation numbers] Event translators use hardcoded creation numbers (e.g., DEPOSIT_EVENT_CREATION_NUMBER = 2). Can Move framework upgrades change these values, causing EventSequenceNumberSchema to store sequences under wrong keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [V2 translation: burned resources] When TokenMutationTranslator encounters burned tokens, it returns error without updating sequence numbers.

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [V2 translation: object groups] For object-group resources, can race conditions between get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource() and event translation cause sequence numbers to be assigned based on stale resource state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Backup: snapshot consistency] When creating RocksDB snapshots, can EventSequenceNumberSchema be in a partially updated state, causing restored nodes to have mismatched sequence numbers compared to active nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Recovery: cache rebuild] After crash recovery, if load_cache_from_db() is not called, can event translation proceed with an empty cache, causing all sequence numbers to restart from database values ignoring in-flight increments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Recovery: WAL replay] During WAL replay after a crash, can EventSequenceNumberSchema entries be replayed out-of-order, causing sequence numbers to be restored to values that don't match the committed event order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Validator sync: sequence divergence] If different validators use different EventSequenceNumberSchema states (due to replication lag), can they produce different V1 event translations for the same V2 events, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/event_sequence_number/mod.rs] [Validator sync: fast sync] During state sync, are EventSequenceNumberSchema entries transferred, or do syncing nodes rebuild sequences from scratch, potentially causing sequence number mismatches? (High)",
