  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_round_manager()] [Last Vote Inconsistency] If recovery_data.last_vote() returns a vote from a different epoch or invalid round, can this cause the new round manager to violate safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: start_round_manager()] [Pipeline Builder Race] Is pipeline_builder created with the correct signer and safety_rules_container, or can there be races where the wrong credentials are used? (Critical)",
