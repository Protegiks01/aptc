  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Error detail loss] When provider.provide() returns Err, only the error is collected. Is critical information like error codes, retry hints, or rate limit status lost that could better diagnose node issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Message formatting] At line 96, errors are joined with comma-space delimiter. If error messages themselves contain commas, can this create ambiguous or malformed output that confuses log parsers or monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [String allocation] The format! macro at lines 94-97 and 114-117 allocates new Strings. With large error counts or frequent checks, can this cause excessive memory allocation and GC pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Link availability] The LINK constant at line 13-14 points to an external URL. If this URL is unreachable, moved, or hijacked, can this mislead users or expose them to malicious content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Result accuracy] The CheckResult only returns score and message. Is the raw latency data (individual samples, min/max, std dev) lost, preventing deeper analysis of node performance characteristics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: default_num_samples] [Insufficient sampling] The default num_samples is 5. Is this statistically sufficient to detect intermittent latency issues, or can unreliable nodes pass by chance if they're only slow 1-2 times out of 5? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: default_delay_between_samples_ms] [Timing window] The default 50ms delay means 5 samples take ~250ms. Can rapid intermittent issues that occur on timescales longer than 250ms completely evade detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Field initialization] With serde defaults, num_allowed_errors defaults to 0. Does this mean a single error fails the check even if num_samples is 1000, making the checker overly sensitive to transient issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Required validation] There's no validation that max_api_latency_ms is set to a non-default value. Can deserializing a config without this field cause max_api_latency_ms to be 0, failing all checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Empty latencies vector] If num_samples is set to a small value and all samples produce errors (but not exceeding num_allowed_errors), the latencies vector becomes empty. Does line 108 panic with division by zero? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Single sample case] If num_samples=1 and that single call succeeds, the average is just that one measurement. Can this be exploited by timing a single lucky fast response to pass the check despite overall poor performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Maximum errors case] If num_allowed_errors = num_samples, all samples can error without failing the check at line 89, but line 108 will panic due to empty latencies. Is this an unhandled edge case? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Boundary values] If average_latency equals max_api_latency_ms exactly, the comparison at line 110 evaluates to false (pass). Is this the intended behavior, or should it fail at equality? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Zero delay edge case] If delay_between_samples_ms=0, the sleep duration is 0ms. Does tokio::time::sleep(Duration::ZERO) yield to the runtime, or does it return immediately without yielding, potentially starving other tasks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Instant overflow] If the system has been running long enough that Instant values approach their maximum representable value, can start.elapsed() overflow or panic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Vector capacity] The latencies and errors vectors are created with vec![] without pre-allocation. Can repeated push operations cause multiple reallocations, fragmenting memory or causing performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Borrow checker bypass] Are there any unsafe blocks or raw pointer operations that could bypass Rust's safety guarantees, allowing memory corruption or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Drop behavior] If LatencyChecker is dropped while check() is executing, does the async future properly clean up resources, or can this leak file descriptors, network connections, or memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyChecker] [Clone safety] LatencyCheckerConfig derives Clone. If Config is cloned and modified after LatencyChecker creation, are there any shared mutable state issues that could cause inconsistent behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: LatencyChecker::new] [Validation missing] The constructor performs no validation on the provided config. Can invalid configs (e.g., num_samples=0) be passed in, causing panics or undefined behavior during check() execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Flatten injection] The #[serde(flatten)] on common field merges CommonCheckerConfig fields. Can an attacker craft JSON with conflicting field names that override critical values or bypass deny_unknown_fields validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Default override] Fields use #[serde(default = ...)] attributes. Can an attacker exploit serde's default mechanism to inject malicious default values through custom deserializer implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Type confusion] All numeric fields are unsigned integers. Can an attacker provide very large values near the type maximums that cause unexpected behavior in arithmetic operations or comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Struct: LatencyCheckerConfig] [Deny_unknown_fields bypass] The deny_unknown_fields attribute should reject extra fields. Can nested structures or the flattened common field allow injection of unexpected fields that affect behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Provider protocol violation] If ApiIndexProvider's provide() method doesn't follow expected contracts (e.g., returning inconsistent results, mutating shared state), can this cause the latency checker to produce incorrect health assessments? (Medium)"
