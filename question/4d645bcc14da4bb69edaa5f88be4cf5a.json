  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call start_jwk_consensus_runtime() to spawn unlimited runtimes consuming system resources, leading to validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Concurrency violation] Does the function enforce singleton runtime initialization, or can multiple concurrent calls create duplicate EpochManager instances leading to inconsistent JWK consensus state across the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Thread pool exhaustion] The runtime is created with only 4 threads via spawn_named_runtime().

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Safety rules bypass] Is the safety_rules_config parameter properly validated before being passed to EpochManager, or can a malicious node operator provide a corrupted config to bypass safety guarantees in JWK consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Identity spoofing] Does the function verify that my_addr corresponds to an actual validator in the current epoch, or can a non-validator node start JWK consensus with an arbitrary address to participate in quorum formation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Channel overflow DoS] The self_sender/self_receiver channel is created with a buffer size of 1,024. Can a Byzantine validator send itself 1,024+ messages to overflow the channel, causing message drops and preventing JWK consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Message ordering violation] Are messages in the self-channel (1,024 capacity) processed in FIFO order, or can message reordering cause out-of-order JWK observation processing leading to incorrect quorum certificate construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Channel backpressure attack] If the self_receiver becomes full, does the sender block or drop messages?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Counter manipulation] The PENDING_SELF_MESSAGES counter is passed to the channel creation. Can an attacker manipulate metrics to hide channel overflow conditions or trigger false monitoring alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Network partition] If network_service_events stops delivering messages due to network issues, does the JWK consensus system detect this and halt safely, or continue with stale state potentially causing validator set inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [RPC flooding] Can a malicious validator flood the network with JWK consensus RPC requests to exhaust the network_client's capacity, preventing legitimate JWK observations from being shared? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Network client injection] Is the network_client parameter authenticated and validated to ensure it connects only to legitimate validator network, or can a compromised network_client route JWK messages to malicious peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Self-message injection] The self_sender allows sending messages to self. Can a Byzantine component inject forged JWK observations through this channel bypassing signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Reconfig event replay] Can an attacker replay old reconfig_events to force JWK consensus to restart with stale validator sets, causing epoch confusion and potential double-signing of JWK updates? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Event ordering violation] If reconfig_events and jwk_updated_events arrive concurrently, is there proper synchronization to prevent processing JWK updates for the wrong epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Event loss] If the reconfig_events or jwk_updated_events channels drop messages due to backpressure, can this cause JWK consensus to miss critical epoch transitions leading to validator exclusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Task panic propagation] If the spawned network_task or epoch_manager task panics, does it crash the entire runtime or get silently ignored, potentially causing JWK consensus to halt without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Orphaned task resources] When the returned Runtime is dropped, are the spawned network_task and epoch_manager tasks properly cancelled and cleaned up, or do they continue running causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Task execution ordering] Are network_task.start() and epoch_manager.start() executed in a specific order that matters?
