  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty module set] If Modules::new() is called with an empty iterator, does it create a valid empty Modules struct, or can this cause issues in downstream functions expecting at least one module? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Module with self-dependency] If a module lists itself in immediate_dependencies(), does this create an immediate cycle that should be rejected, or does it pass through to cause issues later? (High)",
