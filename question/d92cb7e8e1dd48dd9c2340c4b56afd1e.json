  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/constant_time/blstrs_scalar_mul.rs] [Lines: 119-123] [Warmup phase] Does the test include a warmup phase to stabilize CPU caches and branch predictors before measurements, or can cold-start effects bias the initial timing samples? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/constant_time/blstrs_scalar_mul.rs] [Lines: 79-90] [Hamming weight clustering] Can the specific hamming weight choices (1-4 bits vs 200 bits) miss timing vulnerabilities for intermediate hamming weights (50-150 bits) that occur in real private keys? (High)",

(Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/constant_time/blstrs_scalar_mul.rs] [Lines: 93-97] [Base randomness difference] Why does blstrs test with both random and fixed bases while zkcrypto only tests with generator - does this indicate blstrs has timing variations with arbitrary bases?
