  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [PeerId Validation] Line 42 passes my_peer_id - is this validated to be a legitimate validator, or can a non-validator initialize a ProofManager? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Proof-Batch Desync] Can proofs be received via receive_proofs() before their corresponding batches arrive via receive_batches(), and how is this handled? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Orphan Proofs] If a proof is received but its batch never arrives, does it remain in batch_proof_queue forever consuming resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Batch Store Dependency] Since pull_batches_with_transactions() fetches from batch_store, can a corrupted or compromised batch_store return different data than what proofs attest to? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [OptQS Parameter Attack] Lines 131-152 check maybe_optqs_payload_pull_params - can malicious params be used to exclude all batches or only include specific validator's batches? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [OptQS Batch Age] Line 147 uses minimum_batch_age_usecs - can this be set to exclude recent batches, causing delays in transaction inclusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [OptQS Resource Calculation] Lines 132-133 calculate max batch sizes by subtraction - can incorrect calculations allow optqs batches to exceed total limits? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Inline Batch Condition] Lines 156-184 only pull inline batches if proof_queue_fully_utilized is true - can attackers manipulate this condition to prevent/force inline batch usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Inline Transaction Data] Line 168 calls pull_batches_with_transactions - are these transactions validated against their summaries before inclusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Inline Limit Calculation] Lines 158-166 calculate max_inline_txns_to_pull with complex logic - can edge cases cause this to be 0 even when capacity exists? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Max Txns Enforcement] Is max_txns actually enforced, or just a soft limit that can be exceeded if batch granularity is large? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Filtering Limit] max_txns_after_filtering accounts for deduplication - can duplicate transactions be counted incorrectly allowing limit bypass? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Soft Limit Semantics] What is the semantic difference between max_txns_after_filtering and soft_max_txns_after_filtering, and can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Return Non-Full] What happens if return_non_full is false but available batches are insufficient - does it return empty or wait? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Proof Queue Utilization] Line 114 returns proof_queue_fully_utilized - how is this calculated and can it be manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Unique Transaction Count] Line 114 returns cur_unique_txns - is this count accurate considering transaction deduplication across batches? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Type Conversion] Lines 189-203 convert between BatchInfoExt and BatchInfo via .info().clone() - can this conversion lose data or introduce inconsistencies? (Medium)",
