  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version()] [Error Propagation] If get_latest_ledger_info() fails, does the error properly indicate whether storage is corrupted vs temporarily unavailable, allowing peer monitoring to make appropriate decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Timestamp Overflow] Can the u64 timestamp_usecs value overflow after ~584,000 years, and if so, can this cause time-based peer monitoring logic to fail catastrophically? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Clock Skew] Can this function return timestamps that go backwards if validator clocks are manipulated, causing peer monitoring to incorrectly flag honest nodes as lagging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators commit blocks with arbitrarily large or small timestamps that pass consensus but cause peer monitoring to malfunction when comparing sync status? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Microsecond Precision] Does the microsecond precision cause integer comparison issues where timestamps differing by <1ms are treated as equal, potentially masking sync delays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Stale Timestamp] Can this function return timestamps from old committed blocks if the latest block hasn't updated the timestamp, causing peer monitoring to underestimate network latency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_ledger_timestamp_usecs()] [Epoch Boundary] At epoch boundaries, can the timestamp jump significantly (e.g., if reconfiguration takes time), causing false positives in peer lag detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Pruning Race] Can get_first_txn_version() return None if pruning removes all transactions between the check and return, causing the ok_or_else() on line 60 to convert legitimate pruning into an error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Genesis Handling] Does the function correctly handle genesis state where version 0 may or may not exist, or can it incorrectly report errors for fresh nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Pruning Monotonicity] Can the lowest available version decrease if storage restores from backup, violating the assumption that pruned data never returns and confusing peer sync logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Error Message Exposure] The hardcoded error message 'get_first_txn_version() returned None!' on line 61 - does this reveal internal implementation details that could aid attackers in understanding storage structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Option Handling] Is the ok_or_else() pattern safe, or can it incorrectly treat empty databases (None) as errors when they should return version 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Aggressive Pruning] Can extremely aggressive pruning cause lowest_available_version to equal highest_synced_version, causing peer monitoring to think the node has no history available? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Function: get_lowest_available_version()] [Storage Corruption] If get_first_txn_version() returns a version higher than get_latest_version(), can this cause integer underflow when calculating available history range? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Consistency Violation] Can get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() and get_lowest_available_version() return overlapping or inverted ranges (lowest > highest) if called during pruning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Snapshot Isolation] Do all three trait methods read from the same consistent snapshot of storage, or can they see different committed states causing internally inconsistent peer monitoring reports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Caching Issues] If the underlying DbReader caches data, can stale cached values cause get_ledger_timestamp_usecs() to return old timestamps while get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() returns new values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Concurrent Commits] If ledger commits happen between calls to different methods, can the returned data violate blockchain invariants (e.g., timestamp not increasing with version)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Information Disclosure] Do Error::StorageErrorEncountered messages leak storage paths, database connection strings, or internal errors that could help attackers map the node's file system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Amplification] Can storage errors cascade into peer monitoring failures that cause the entire node to be isolated from the network, enabling targeted DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Timing Side Channel] Do error returns take different amounts of time depending on error type, allowing attackers to probe storage state through timing analysis of peer monitoring responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Recovery] If storage errors are transient (e.g., disk I/O timeout), does the interface allow retry logic, or do single failures permanently mark peers as unhealthy? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Clone Safety] Can cloning StorageReader create race conditions where clones read inconsistent state due to Arc sharing, causing different monitoring threads to report conflicting peer status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Send Bound] The 'static + Send bounds allow cross-thread usage - can this enable race conditions where one thread reads during another's commit, seeing partial state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Trait Implementation] [Trait Object Lifetime] Does the dyn DbReader trait object lifetime match the StorageReader lifetime, or can dangling references occur if the underlying storage is dropped prematurely? (High)"
