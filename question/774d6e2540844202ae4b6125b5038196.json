  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Multi-feature] [Gas payer features] GasPayerEnabled, FeePayerAccountOptional, and SponsoredAutomaticAccountCreation enable fee payment variants. Can conflicting settings allow transaction fee manipulation or sponsor impersonation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Multi-feature] [Module event migration] ModuleEvent and ModuleEventMigration handle event system changes. Can improper migration sequence cause event loss or double-emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: CodeDependencyCheck] [Dependency bypass] If CodeDependencyCheck is disabled through governance, can malicious modules bypass dependency verification and deploy with circular dependencies or reference non-existent modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: TreatFriendAsPrivate] [Visibility violation] Disabling TreatFriendAsPrivate could expose internal module functions. Can this be exploited to call privileged functions that should be private? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: ChargeInvariantViolation] [Gas bypass] If ChargeInvariantViolation is disabled, can transactions that violate Move invariants execute without proper gas charging, enabling DoS attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: StorageDeletionRefund] [Economic exploit] Can malicious actors exploit StorageDeletionRefund by repeatedly storing and deleting data to extract more refunds than paid, draining validator rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: SingleSenderAuthenticator] [Auth bypass] Does SingleSenderAuthenticator enforce proper signature validation, or can it be exploited to authorize transactions with weaker authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: PartialGovernanceVoting] [Voting manipulation] Can PartialGovernanceVoting be exploited to split voting power in ways that manipulate governance outcomes or enable double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: ObjectCodeDeployment] [Code injection] Does ObjectCodeDeployment enable deployment of code into existing objects? Could this allow code injection into trusted system objects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: LimitMaxIdentifierLength] [DOS through long identifiers] If LimitMaxIdentifierLength is disabled, can extremely long module or function names cause parsing failures, memory exhaustion, or database storage issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: RejectUnstableBytecode] [Bytecode security] If RejectUnstableBytecode or RejectUnstableBytecodeForScript are disabled, can unfinished bytecode features be exploited before proper security review? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: DisallowUserNative] [Native function abuse] If DisallowUserNative is disabled, can user-deployed modules declare native functions to bypass Move VM safety and directly access system resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: RefundableBytes] [Storage economics] Can RefundableBytes be exploited to manipulate storage pricing, getting refunds for storage that was never actually released? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/feature_flags.rs] [Feature: MaxObjectNestingCheck] [Stack overflow] If MaxObjectNestingCheck is disabled, can deeply nested objects cause stack overflow in Move VM during object traversal or serialization? (High)",
