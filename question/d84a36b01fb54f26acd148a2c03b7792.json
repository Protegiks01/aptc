  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Compilation] Can compiler optimizations be manipulated through RUSTFLAGS to introduce vulnerabilities in the compiled binary, such as removing bounds checks or disabling security features in the cache worker? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Binary Integrity] If the compiled cache worker binary is distributed without signature verification, can an attacker replace it with a malicious version that appears to function correctly but exfiltrates private keys or manipulates cached transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Config Injection] Can an attacker modify the YAML configuration file after validation but before the worker starts processing, injecting malicious Redis addresses or gRPC endpoints through race conditions in the file system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Environment Variables] Can environment variables override critical configuration values (like redis_main_instance_address) through the Figment configuration loader, allowing an attacker with env access to redirect the cache to a malicious Redis instance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Config Path Validation] Does the config file loading check for symlinks that could be exploited for privilege escalation by pointing to sensitive files that get parsed as YAML configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 13-14] [Async Entry Point] Can race conditions in tokio runtime initialization cause the cache worker to start processing transactions before the panic handler is properly registered, leading to silent failures that don't get logged or reported? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent Startup] If multiple instances of the cache worker are accidentally started with the same configuration, can they race on Redis writes causing cache corruption where transaction versions are written out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Static Initialization] Can the ALLOC global allocator initialization race with other static initializations in dependencies, causing use of uninitialized memory or double-initialization panics during process startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 18] [Error Context] Does the expect() error message 'Cache worker failed to run' provide sufficient context for debugging production failures, or will operators struggle to diagnose root causes of indexer outages without detailed error information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 16-18] [Error Recovery] Can transient errors (network timeouts, temporary Redis unavailability) during startup cause the entire process to exit, requiring external orchestration to retry, or should the main function implement retry logic for resilience? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Fatal Errors] Are there certain error conditions that should trigger immediate process termination (like chain ID mismatch) versus errors that should retry indefinitely (like network interruptions), and is this distinction properly implemented? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory Limits] Does the process enforce memory limits to prevent unbounded growth when processing large transaction batches, or can sustained high-volume transaction streams cause OOM conditions that crash the cache worker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [CPU Resources] Can the tokio runtime be configured to use excessive CPU cores on the host machine, potentially starving other critical services (like the file store worker) and causing overall indexer performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Line: 10-11] [Memory Profiling] Does jemalloc's memory profiling feature get disabled in production builds, or could it be enabled by an attacker to extract sensitive information about transaction patterns and cache structure through heap analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Service Coordination] Can the cache worker start processing transactions before the file store worker has established baseline metadata, creating a window where cached transactions have no corresponding file store entries causing data inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Health Checks] Does the health check endpoint start serving traffic before the cache worker is fully initialized and connected to Redis, potentially causing orchestration systems to route traffic to non-functional instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Metrics Export] Can an attacker access Prometheus metrics on the health_check_port to gather intelligence about transaction volumes, cache hit rates, and system performance before launching targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Container Security] In containerized deployments, can the cache worker be exploited through container escape vulnerabilities that leverage the jemalloc allocator's interaction with kernel memory management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Escalation] Does the cache worker require root privileges during startup for any operations, creating attack surface for privilege escalation if an initial compromise of the worker process occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-cache-worker/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File Permissions] Can improper file permissions on the config YAML file allow unauthorized users to modify Redis credentials or gRPC endpoints, compromising the entire indexer infrastructure? (High)"
