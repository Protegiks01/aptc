  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_delete_table_item()] [TokenWriteSet Variant] Line 306 matches only TokenWriteSet::TokenId - can other variants slip through causing deletion to fail silently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [TokenData Tuple] Line 192 expects tuple (TokenData, CurrentTokenData) - can mismatched tuple structures cause pattern matching failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [CollectionData Tuple] Line 199 expects tuple (CollectionData, CurrentCollectionData) - can missing elements cause unpacking errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Cross-Table Consistency] If current_token_datas is updated but token_datas fails, can this cause inconsistency between current and historical tables? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Connection State] Line 73 passes mutable connection to CollectionData::from_write_table_item() - can connection state changes during processing cause subsequent operations to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Transaction Boundary] Does from_transaction() operate within a database transaction, or can partial failures leave the database in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_write_table_item()] [Property Version Type] Line 266 assigns token_id.property_version as BigDecimal - can precision loss during conversion cause property version mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/tokens.rs] [Function: from_delete_table_item()] [Property Version Comparison] Line 323 uses property_version from token_id - can floating point comparison issues cause wrong token versions to be deleted? (Medium)"
