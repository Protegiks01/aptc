  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Validator queries] If validator nodes expose public APIs, can AcceptType manipulation cause performance degradation by forcing expensive JSON conversion on high-frequency queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Consensus data] For endpoints exposing consensus state, can BCS format leak sensitive voting information or validator set details that should be filtered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Epoch transition] During epoch transitions, can format confusion cause inconsistent views of validator sets between nodes using different API formats? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Module deployment] When deploying Move modules via API, can BCS format bypass bytecode verification that occurs during JSON conversion, allowing deployment of malicious modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Script execution] For script execution endpoints, does AcceptType affect how script arguments are parsed, enabling type confusion attacks in script execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Entry function] Can format selection allow attackers to call entry functions with arguments that bypass type checking, executing with unintended parameter values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Package publish] For package publishing, can BCS format allow submission of packages with malformed manifests that bypass validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType::Json] [Balance manipulation] Can JSON number precision issues allow attackers to manipulate account balances by submitting transactions with amounts that round differently than intended? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Fee calculation] Does AcceptType affect transaction fee calculation, allowing attackers to submit underpriced transactions by exploiting format-specific fee estimation bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Coin operations] For coin transfer endpoints, can format differences allow double-spending by creating transactions that validate in one format but fail in another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Token standards] For fungible token operations, can BCS format bypass decimal precision validation that prevents token inflation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Multiple matches] If both JSON and BCS MIME types appear in Accept header, which takes precedence? Can attackers exploit priority differences to force unexpected format selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Invalid MIME] How are malformed MIME types handled? Can specially crafted invalid types cause panics or unwrap() errors that crash the API service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Format detection] Can clients override AcceptType via query parameters or other headers, creating format confusion when Accept header says one thing but actual behavior differs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: from_request()] [Body interaction] Although _body parameter is unused, can attackers exploit scenarios where request body content affects AcceptType determination in future implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Enum: AcceptType] [Version skew] Can API version mismatches between client and server cause AcceptType to be interpreted differently, leading to incompatible format negotiation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/accept_type.rs] [Function: parse_accept()] [Locale sensitivity] Can locale-specific MIME type handling (e.g., number formatting) cause different AcceptType selection based on server locale settings? (Low)"
