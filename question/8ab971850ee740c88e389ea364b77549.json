  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Heap fragmentation] Can repeated creation and destruction of PackageName instances with varying sizes cause heap fragmentation that degrades validator performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [TODO comment security] The code contains a TODO comment stating rules are 'tentative and subject to change' - could this indicate incomplete validation that leaves known security holes unaddressed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Hyphen position rules] Unlike DNS or NPM which restrict hyphens at start/end, this validation allows leading/trailing hyphens after the first character - can this be exploited for confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Single character names] Does validation allow single-character package names (e.g., 'a', '_'), which could enable namespace exhaustion attacks or collision with common abbreviations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: is_valid_package_name()] [Numeric-only names] Can package names consist entirely of digits after the first character (e.g., 'a123456789'), potentially causing confusion with version numbers or addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Filesystem encoding mismatch] On systems with different default character encodings, could PackageName strings be interpreted differently, causing consensus failures between validators on different platforms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Line ending normalization] Can package names containing line endings (CRLF vs LF) be normalized differently across platforms, enabling package name collisions or Git manipulation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Path separator injection] Despite validation, can package names be combined with path separators in downstream code to create path traversal vulnerabilities when packages are cached locally? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Send/Sync safety] Is PackageName properly Send + Sync for safe concurrent access, or could sharing across threads cause data races in validation state or string mutations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Interior mutability bypass] Can attackers wrap PackageName in RefCell or similar interior mutability types to mutate validated package names without triggering re-validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Function: new()] [Type parameter exploitation] Can the generic 'impl Into<String>' parameter accept types that perform expensive computations or side effects during conversion, enabling DoS through malicious type implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Hash collision attacks] Does PackageName implement Hash, and if so, is it resistant to hash collision attacks that could degrade HashMap performance when used as a key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Compiler integration vulnerability] When PackageName is passed to the Move compiler, could invalid names bypass compiler validation and inject malicious code into compiled bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Storage key generation] If package names are used to generate storage keys or Merkle tree paths, could crafted names cause key collisions or predictable key generation patterns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [API endpoint injection] When package names appear in REST API URLs or query parameters, could special characters enable URL injection or parameter pollution attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Transaction metadata exploitation] If package names are embedded in transaction metadata or events, could oversized or malicious names cause transaction validation failures or bloat chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [Upgrade compatibility] If package name validation rules change in future protocol upgrades, could existing packages with now-invalid names cause consensus splits between upgraded and non-upgraded validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-manifest/src/package_name.rs] [Struct: PackageName] [State explosion] Can attackers register unlimited packages with valid but unique names, causing state storage exhaustion and forcing validators to increase storage requirements? (High)"
