  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Peer::from_addrs validation] Does Peer::from_addrs() validate the addresses vector, or can it accept empty/malformed addresses that break peer connectivity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Role assignment] PeerRole::Validator and PeerRole::ValidatorFullNode are assigned - can incorrect role assignment cause authorization failures in downstream authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Early return] If Url::parse() fails, the function returns early - can this leave the cache in a partially updated state if some chains succeed and others fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [RestError handling] RestError from the client is mapped but not inspected - can specific error types (404, 500, timeout) require different handling to prevent cache corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: test_validator_cache_updater_with_invalid_address] [Test adequacy] The test expects empty caches with invalid addresses - does this properly test error handling, or can invalid addresses cause partial updates in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: test_validator_cache_updater_with_valid_address] [Test realism] The test uses hardcoded network addresses - are these representative of real validator addresses, or can production addresses have different formats that break parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Read-modify-write] The cache.insert() is not atomic with the emptiness checks - can concurrent updates cause one update to overwrite another, losing validator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: run()] [Loop cancellation] The infinite loop in run() has no graceful shutdown mechanism - can abrupt termination leave write locks held or caches in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: new()] [Update interval validation] The update_interval has no bounds checking - can zero or negative durations cause immediate repeated updates that exhaust resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty address map] If trusted_full_node_addresses is empty, the updater still runs - can this cause unnecessary CPU usage with no-op updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update()] [Unbounded error labels] VALIDATOR_SET_UPDATE_FAILED_COUNT uses err.to_string() as label - can diverse error messages create unlimited metric cardinality causing metrics storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Part separation] response.into_parts() consumes the response - can this prevent retry logic from accessing the original response on partial failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [State extraction] The state variable contains chain_id and epoch - can missing or malformed state headers cause panics during field access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Insert overwrite] HashMap::insert() overwrites existing entries - can this cause loss of validator data if an update with fewer validators overwrites a previous update with more validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [No version check] The cache insert doesn't check if the existing epoch is newer - can out-of-order updates cause old validator sets to overwrite newer ones? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Log injection] If chain_name contains newlines or escape sequences, can this break log parsing or inject fake log entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/validator_cache.rs] [Function: update_for_chain()] [Sensitive data logging] Validator network addresses in debug logs may contain sensitive routing information - can log access provide reconnaissance data for network attacks? (Low)"
