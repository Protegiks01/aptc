  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Struct: CodeWriterData] [Map consistency] Should output_location_map and label_map be kept in sync (e.g., every label position has a corresponding location)? If not, can desynchronization cause issues where labels point to code with incorrect source location attribution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: new()] [Initial state] The function inserts ByteIndex(0) -> loc into output_location_map, but if the initial location is invalid or represents non-existent source code, can this cause all generated code without explicit location updates to be attributed to an incorrect source? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: insert_at_label()] [Panic propagation] The expect('label undefined') will panic if the label doesn't exist, but does this provide sufficient context about which label failed and where it was supposed to be used, making debugging difficult in large code generation contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: unindent()] [Panic behavior] The assert! will panic on underflow, but can this panic occur in legitimate code patterns where indentation is conditionally managed, causing unexpected crashes in otherwise correct code generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [General] [Error recovery] Does the CodeWriter support any error recovery mechanisms, or if any operation fails (OOM, panic in hook, etc.), is the entire CodeWriter state corrupted and unusable for subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: insert_at_label()] [Performance] The std::mem::take() followed by into_iter().map().collect() creates a temporary copy of label_map and output_location_map, but if these maps are large, can this cause significant memory overhead and performance degradation in code generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Struct: CodeWriterData] [Cloning cost] The Loc type is cloned in multiple places (set_location, get_source_location, new), but if Loc contains large data structures or expensive-to-clone resources, can repeated location updates cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: extract_result()] [Move semantics] The std::mem::take(&mut self.0.borrow_mut().output) moves the output string, but does this properly reset the CodeWriter to an initial state, or are other fields (label_map, output_location_map) left in an inconsistent state with stale references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: insert_at_label()] [UTF-8 boundary] When insert_str() inserts at index.0 as usize, is this byte position guaranteed to be on a UTF-8 character boundary, or can insertion at arbitrary byte offsets corrupt multibyte characters and produce invalid UTF-8 in the output string? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: emit_str()] [Character boundary] When checking data.output.ends_with('\\\\n'), does this correctly handle cases where the output ends mid-way through a UTF-8 multibyte character, or can this cause incorrect indentation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: get_output_byte_index()] [UTF-8 assumptions] The function uses ByteIndex which represents byte offsets, but if column is specified in characters rather than bytes for UTF-8 strings, can the calculation produce incorrect byte indices pointing inside multibyte characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: process_result()] [Empty output] If the output string is completely empty, does the function correctly handle the case where trim_end() returns empty string, and is the subsequent indexing safe? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: emit()] [Empty string input] If emit() is called with an empty string '', does this trigger unnecessary location map updates or other operations that could accumulate overhead in loops with many emit('') calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: get_source_location()] [Zero index] Can get_source_location() be called with ByteIndex(0) immediately after construction, and does it correctly return the initial location set in new(), or can this fail if output_location_map is empty? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/code_writer.rs] [Function: create_label()] [Label at end] If create_label() is called when output is at maximum length (near u32::MAX), and subsequent operations overflow the ByteIndex, can this cause the label to wrap around to 0 and point to the beginning of output? (Low)"
