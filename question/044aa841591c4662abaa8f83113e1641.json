  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: get_signature_type()] [String consistency] Do the signature type strings returned by get_signature_type() exactly match the type_ field values used in parsing functions, or can inconsistencies break queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: parse_multi_signature()] [Empty signatures array] Can s.signatures be empty while the bitmap indicates signatures should exist, causing the loop at line 153 to not execute and return empty vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: parse_multi_agent_signature()] [Empty secondary signers] If secondary_signer_addresses is empty, does the loop at line 200 correctly handle this case, or can it cause index mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: parse_fee_payer_signature()] [Zero secondary signers] Can fee payer transactions with no secondary signers cause the multi_agent_index calculation at line 256 to assign incorrect indices? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/signatures.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Empty address] What happens if override_address or sender is an empty string—does standardize_address handle this gracefully, or can it cause database constraint violations? (Medium)",
