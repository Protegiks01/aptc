  "[File: aptos-core/storage/accumulator/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_root_hash()] [Caching Issue] Is get_root_hash() called repeatedly for the same num_leaves, and can this cause performance issues when reconstructing non-frozen nodes? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/accumulator/src/lib.rs] [Trait: HashReader] [Storage Consistency] If HashReader reads from inconsistent storage snapshots between get() calls, can this cause different validators to compute different root hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/accumulator/src/lib.rs] [Trait: HashReader] [Error Handling] If HashReader::get() returns errors inconsistently for the same position across different calls, can this cause non-deterministic accumulator behavior? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/accumulator/src/lib.rs] [Struct: MerkleAccumulatorView] [num_leaves Consistency] If num_leaves is modified externally during view operations, can this cause inconsistent tree traversal and incorrect results? (Critical)",
