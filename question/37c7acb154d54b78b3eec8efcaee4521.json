  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger repeated save_config calls with large configurations to fill disk space, causing validator node failures and loss of liveness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: override_config_mut()] [Consensus Parameter Injection] Can override_config_mut at lines 114-116 be used to inject malicious consensus parameters (round timeout = 0, quorum size = 1) that break AptosBFT safety guarantees or allow single-validator block commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: get_yaml()] [Validator Set Manipulation] Can the configuration override mechanism be exploited to inject unauthorized validators into the validator set configuration, allowing Byzantine nodes to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: base_config_mut()] [Base Config Poisoning] Can base_config_mut at lines 122-124 be exploited to modify the base configuration after construction, causing incorrect diff calculations that hide malicious config changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: diff_override_config_yaml()] [Network Config Injection] Can malicious network configurations (peer discovery, RPC endpoints, connection limits) be injected through overrides to enable network partition attacks or Sybil attacks? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: diff_override_config_yaml()] [Safety Rule Bypass] Can configuration overrides disable or weaken safety rules (double-sign prevention, voting constraints) in the consensus layer, allowing validators to equivocate? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: get_yaml()] [Gas Parameter Manipulation] Can gas-related configuration parameters (max gas per block, gas price multipliers) be overridden to create consensus divergence where validators disagree on valid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: override_config()] [Immutable Config Bypass] Does the read-only getter at lines 110-112 properly prevent config tampering, or can Rust interior mutability patterns (RefCell, Cell) bypass this and allow unauthorized modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: override_config_mut()] [Concurrent Modification] Can concurrent access to override_config_mut from multiple threads cause race conditions where config reads see partially updated state, leading to consensus divergence?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: get_yaml()] [TOCTOU in Diff] Between reading override_config (line 127) and base_config (line 128), can concurrent modifications cause inconsistent diffs that hide or expose incorrect configuration changes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Struct: OverrideNodeConfig] [Send/Sync Safety] Is OverrideNodeConfig properly marked as Send/Sync, and are there any interior mutability patterns that could cause data races when shared across threads? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: diff_override_config_yaml()] [Diff Inconsistency] At lines 20-32, can the order of keys in the Mapping affect the diff result, causing non-deterministic configuration outputs across different validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: diff_override_config_yaml()] [Missing Key Detection] When a key exists in base_mapping but not in override_mapping, is this properly detected as a deletion, or does it silently use the base value creating config inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/override_node_config.rs] [Function: diff_override_config_yaml()] [Sequence Diff Limitation] At lines 63-68, sequence comparison is all-or-nothing - can this hide partial modifications in arrays (like validator list changes) that should be detected and flagged?
