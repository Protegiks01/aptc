  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Resource access control] Is there proper access control ensuring only authorized system modules can emit events with this type tag, or can any deployed smart contract emit RandomnessGeneratedEvent to pollute the event stream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Friend module bypass] Since only aptos_framework::block is a friend of the randomness module, can this restriction be bypassed through event emission to allow non-friend modules to fake randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Test environment divergence] In test environments where the randomness module might be mocked or modified, can the hardcoded type tag cause test failures or worse, allow test-only vulnerabilities to leak into production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Unicode edge cases] Can Unicode normalization issues in the string '0x1::randomness::RandomnessGeneratedEvent' cause TypeTag::from_str() to produce different results on systems with different locale settings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Empty event handling] What happens if a transaction emits a RandomnessGeneratedEvent with zero size or corrupted data - does the type tag check still pass, potentially causing downstream processing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Deref safety] When consensus code compares event.type_tag() == RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG.deref(), can the deref operation ever panic or return unexpected values due to Lazy initialization issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Reference lifetime] Are there lifetime issues where the dereferenced TypeTag from the Lazy static could be used after the static is somehow deallocated or corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Borrow checker bypass] Can unsafe code elsewhere violate borrow checker guarantees to mutate the supposedly immutable TypeTag inside the Lazy static, causing validation inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/randomness_event.rs] [Static: RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Reorg attack] During blockchain reorganizations, can events with this type tag be replayed or duplicated across different branches, causing incorrect randomness usage tracking in the consensus layer? (Medium)",
