  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Parallel execution interaction] [Transaction isolation] In parallel transaction execution, can different transactions see different interner states due to race conditions, causing non-deterministic transaction results that differ across re-execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Function: intern() in hot path] [Performance impact] Is intern() called in the critical path of transaction execution? Can lock contention or allocation overhead here directly impact transaction throughput and cause validators to miss block deadlines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [StructIdentifier usage] [Type identity] Since StructIdentifier contains InternedModuleId, can bugs in module interning cause type confusion where two different struct types are considered identical, breaking Move's type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Function loading interaction] [Cache coherency] When Functions and Modules are loaded with InternedModuleIds, can cache inconsistencies cause loaded entities to reference wrong modules after flush or concurrent updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Function: intern() write lock upgrade] [Priority inversion] Can a low-priority thread holding the read lock prevent high-priority consensus-critical threads from acquiring the write lock, causing priority inversion that delays block processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Multiple read locks] [Starvation] Can many concurrent readers starve writers indefinitely, preventing new modules from being interned and causing transaction execution to fail with 'module not found' errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [RwLock poisoning] [Lock recovery] If a thread panics while holding the write lock, does parking_lot's RwLock recover gracefully, or does it poison the lock making the interner permanently unusable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Unsafe pointer operations] [ARM vs x86] Can weak memory ordering on ARM processors cause the unsafe '&*(ptr as *const T)' to see stale data that x86 processors wouldn't, leading to validator divergence on ARM-based nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Vec reallocation] [Heap fragmentation] On systems with different memory allocators (jemalloc vs system malloc), can buffer reallocation behavior differ, causing different memory patterns that affect timing and determinism? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Buffer growth strategy] [Virtual memory] On systems with limited address space, can the exponentially growing buffer allocation strategy cause address space exhaustion before physical memory is exhausted, causing mmap failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Overall design] [Global state] Does having a shared global interner violate Move's module isolation principles? Can bugs in one module's loading affect other unrelated modules through shared interner corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Versioning] [Upgrade safety] If the interner implementation changes in a protocol upgrade, can nodes running different versions assign different InternedModuleIds, causing hard forks during the upgrade window? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Function: intern() complexity] [Algorithmic complexity] What is the worst-case time complexity of intern()? Can an attacker craft ModuleIds that cause O(n) or worse lookup times in the BTreeMap, creating a transaction execution DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/module_id_interner.rs] [Serialization] [State sync] Are InternedModuleIds serializable for state snapshots? Can deserialization on a different node with a different interner state cause index mismatches that corrupt the state? (Critical)"
