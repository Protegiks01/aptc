(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-fullnode/src/fullnode_data_service.rs] [Function: get_transactions_from_node()] [Batch integrity] The comment on line 154 states clients can use start and end version to ensure no gaps - but if the coordinator skips versions, can gaps be undetectable? (High)",
