  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Serialization Limit] If max_parallel_serialization_tasks is set to 1, does this create a serialization bottleneck that can be exploited to delay consensus message propagation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Interval Manipulation] Can setting garbage_collection_interval_ms to very small values cause excessive CPU usage in the GC loop, degrading validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Struct: ConsensusPublisher] [Arc Cycle] Could circular Arc references between ConsensusPublisher, ConsensusObserverClient, and NetworkClient cause memory leaks if not properly managed? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: get_active_subscribers()] [Deadlock Risk] Can nested RwLock acquisitions (if active_subscribers is read while another lock is held) cause deadlocks in complex call chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Async Safety] Is the non-blocking design truly safe if the underlying try_send() triggers complex drop handlers that could block or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Protocol Confusion] Can an attacker send malformed Subscribe/Unsubscribe requests that are accepted but cause inconsistent state between publisher and network layer? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Response Injection] Can the ResponseSender be captured and replayed to inject fake SubscribeAck/UnsubscribeAck responses, confusing peer subscription state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Serialization Format] If serialize_message_for_peer() produces peer-specific serialization, can an attacker exploit format differences to cause deserialization errors on the receiver? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: add_active_subscriber()] [No Deduplication] Does HashSet::insert properly handle duplicate peer_network_id values, or can an attacker exploit hash collisions to bypass subscription limits? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: remove_active_subscriber()] [Use-After-Free] After removing a subscriber, can messages already in the serialization pipeline be delivered to the removed peer, potentially leaking consensus data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Resurrection Attack] Can a peer rapidly reconnect after being garbage collected to maintain subscription without proper authorization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Message Validation] Does the publisher validate ConsensusObserverDirectSend message content before broadcasting, or can malicious consensus code publish invalid blocks to observers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Size Limits] Are there size limits on ConsensusObserverDirectSend messages to prevent publishing extremely large payloads that could DoS observers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Serialization Bomb] Can crafted messages cause serialization to produce exponentially larger output, amplifying bandwidth consumption to observers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Identity Spoofing] Does PeerNetworkId provide strong identity guarantees, or can an attacker spoof peer identities to subscribe multiple times or impersonate legitimate observers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Network ID Confusion] Can an attacker exploit NetworkId differences to appear as different peers while being the same physical node, bypassing subscription limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Struct: ConsensusPublisher] [Cross-Network Leakage] Can subscribers on one NetworkId (e.g., Public) receive messages intended for another network (e.g., Validator), leaking consensus information? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Equivocation Propagation] If consensus produces equivocating blocks, does the publisher broadcast all conflicting blocks to observers, potentially helping attackers distribute invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Subscription Replay] Can Subscribe requests be replayed after Unsubscribe to re-establish subscriptions without proper authorization, bypassing cooldown periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Partial Delivery] If send_serialized_message_to_peer() succeeds for some peers but fails for others, can this cause observers to have inconsistent views of consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Future Cancellation] If the start() future is dropped before completing, are resources properly cleaned up or can active subscriptions leak indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Task Cancellation] If the tokio::spawn task is aborted, can partially serialized messages cause corruption or network protocol violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Select Fairness] Does tokio::select! fairly alternate between processing subscriptions and garbage collection, or can one starve the other under heavy load? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Silent Errors] When get_connected_peers_and_metadata() fails, garbage collection returns early - can repeated failures cause unbounded subscriber accumulation? (High)",
