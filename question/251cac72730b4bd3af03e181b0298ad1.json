  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Critical Implementation Bug] The build() method creates a ShardedBlockPartitioner::new() instance, but the ShardedBlockPartitioner struct implementation does not exist in the codebase - can this cause a compilation failure or runtime panic when validators attempt to partition blocks, leading to total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Missing Validation] Does build() validate that num_shards is non-zero before constructing the partitioner, or can a validator use the default configuration with num_shards=0 to cause division-by-zero errors in get_anchor_shard_id() leading to validator crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Type Safety] Can the build() method be called on a PartitionerV1Config with uninitialized or partially initialized fields due to the builder pattern, creating an invalid BlockPartitioner that produces non-deterministic partitioning results across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Integer Validation] The num_shards field defaults to 0 in new() - can a malicious validator or misconfigured node use num_shards=0 to cause modulo-by-zero panics in partition logic, halting block execution and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker set num_shards to usize::MAX (18_446_744_073_709_551_615) to cause memory exhaustion when allocating shard data structures, leading to validator node crashes and potential network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: num_shards()] [Validation Bypass] Does the num_shards() builder method validate input ranges, or can it accept num_shards=1 which would disable parallel execution entirely, degrading network performance below critical thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Consensus Divergence] If different validators are configured with different num_shards values, will they produce different block partitioning results, causing state divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Integer Overflow] Can extremely large num_shards values cause integer overflow when multiplied with transaction counts or round IDs in downstream partitioning logic, leading to incorrect shard assignments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [Bounds Violation] The max_partitioning_rounds defaults to 3, but can be set to any RoundId (usize) value - can an attacker set it to exceed MAX_ALLOWED_PARTITIONING_ROUNDS (8), causing index out-of-bounds errors or array access violations in round tracking logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: max_partitioning_rounds()] [Validation Missing] Does max_partitioning_rounds() enforce the MAX_ALLOWED_PARTITIONING_ROUNDS=8 constant limit defined in types/src/block_executor/partitioner.rs, or can validators exceed this causing undefined behavior in ShardedTxnIndex comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [DoS via Excessive Rounds] Can setting max_partitioning_rounds to a very large value (e.g., usize::MAX) cause the partitioner to iterate indefinitely, creating a computational DoS that prevents block execution and causes validator timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [Zero Rounds] Can max_partitioning_rounds be set to 0, causing the partitioner to skip all partitioning rounds and place all transactions in GLOBAL_ROUND_ID, defeating parallel execution and causing severe performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [Type Confusion] Since RoundId is a type alias for usize, can mixing max_partitioning_rounds with GLOBAL_ROUND_ID (MAX_ALLOWED_PARTITIONING_ROUNDS + 1 = 9) in comparisons cause logic errors where transactions are incorrectly assigned to global vs. partitioned rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Non-Determinism] The cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold is an f32 (0.9 default) used for partitioning decisions - can floating-point precision differences across different CPU architectures or compiler versions cause validators to make divergent partitioning decisions, breaking consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold()] [Invalid Float Values] Does the builder method validate that threshold is in range [0.0, 1.0], or can an attacker set it to negative values, NaN, or +/-Infinity, causing comparison logic to malfunction and produce incorrect partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Threshold Bypass] Can setting threshold to 0.0 disable cross-shard dependency avoidance entirely, causing all transactions to be placed in separate shards regardless of conflicts, potentially breaking transaction ordering invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Threshold Maximum] Can setting threshold to 1.0 or higher cause the partitioner to never avoid cross-shard dependencies, forcing all transactions into sequential execution and eliminating parallelism benefits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [NaN Propagation] If cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold is set to f32::NAN, can NaN propagation in comparison operations (NaN != NaN) cause all threshold checks to fail, leading to unpredictable partitioning behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Subnormal Values] Can using subnormal float values near zero for threshold cause denormalized arithmetic that produces different results across validator implementations, breaking determinism? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Negative Threshold] Can setting threshold to negative values (e.g., -1.0) invert the intended logic, causing the partitioner to maximize cross-shard dependencies instead of avoiding them? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: partition_last_round] [Logic Inconsistency] The partition_last_round boolean defaults to false - can inconsistent values across validators cause some to partition the final round while others place it in GLOBAL_ROUND_ID, leading to different CrossShardEdges and consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: partition_last_round] [State Commitment] If partition_last_round=true on some validators and false on others, will the resulting PartitionedTransactions structure have different transaction orderings, causing different state root computations and chain forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: partition_last_round()] [Race Condition] Can the partition_last_round flag be modified after the config is created but before build() is called in concurrent code, causing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: new()] [Partial Initialization] The new() method sets num_shards=0, which is invalid - can a caller use new().build() directly without setting num_shards, creating a broken partitioner that will panic on first use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Builder Pattern] [State Mutation] All builder methods take 'mut self' and return Self - can concurrent access to a partially built config cause data races if the builder is shared across threads before being finalized? (High)"
