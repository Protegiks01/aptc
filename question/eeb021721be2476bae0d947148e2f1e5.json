  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Label Cardinality] Can attackers cause unbounded growth in NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH time series by spoofing discovery messages with fake peer_id values, leading to memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Gauge Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators intentionally set NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH to 0 (no mismatch) even when their keys are compromised, hiding security incidents from monitoring and allowing persistent key-based attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Panic on Initialization] If register_int_gauge_vec!() fails and unwrap() panics, can this crash validators during startup or runtime when first checking for key mismatches, preventing nodes from detecting compromised keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [False Negative] Can timing issues or stale onchain state cause NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH to incorrectly show 0 during actual key rotation events, preventing detection of impersonation attacks during validator key updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Observability Gap] Does the gauge only check for mismatches at specific intervals, potentially missing short-lived key compromise windows where attackers briefly use stolen keys before reverting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Label Injection] Can malicious peers inject crafted peer_id or network_id values that exploit metric export vulnerabilities when NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH is scraped by monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Trust Boundary] Are the role_type, network_id, and peer_id labels derived from trusted onchain data or untrusted network messages, and can attackers manipulate these to hide key mismatch detections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Memory Leak] Can the three-dimensional label space (role_type × network_id × peer_id) grow unbounded as new validators join/leave, causing gradual memory exhaustion in long-running validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Gauge Semantics] Is the gauge value properly reset when key mismatches are resolved, or can stale gauge values persist indefinitely showing false positives that cause unnecessary validator rotation or slashing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Lazy Initialization Race] Can the Lazy::new() pattern used for all three metrics cause race conditions if multiple threads access these metrics before initialization completes, leading to duplicate initializations or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Memory Exhaustion] Can the combined label cardinality across all three metrics (EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S, DISCOVERY_COUNTS, NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH) create millions of time series that exhaust validator memory when facing discovery message floods from malicious peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Panic Propagation] If any of the three metric registration calls fails and unwrap() panics, can this cause cascading failures where discovery functionality becomes unavailable, preventing validators from finding peers and causing network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Metric Scraping DoS] Can attackers repeatedly scrape metrics endpoints to trigger expensive histogram/counter aggregations across thousands of label combinations, causing CPU exhaustion and degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Information Aggregation] Can attackers combine information from all three metrics (timing data, peer counts, key mismatches) to build a complete profile of validator discovery behavior and network topology for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Static Lifetime] Are the 'static lifetime metrics safe for use in async contexts where discovery events are processed concurrently, or can this lead to subtle memory ordering issues and metric corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Label Sanitization] Is there any sanitization of label values before they're passed to the metrics library, or can injection of special characters cause metric export format corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Monitoring Dependency] Can failures in the aptos_metrics_core library cause the entire discovery system to fail due to unwrap() calls, creating a critical dependency where monitoring infrastructure failures cause protocol failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [All Metrics] [Metric Namespace Collision] Do the metric names ('simple_onchain_discovery_event_processing_loop_busy_duration_s', 'aptos_simple_onchain_discovery_counts', 'aptos_network_key_mismatch') have potential collisions with other Aptos components that could cause monitoring confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Trust Model] How are peer_id, network_id, and role_type values validated before being used as metric labels, and can untrusted network input flow directly into these metrics without sanitization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Cardinality Control] Is there any rate limiting or cardinality control on unique label combinations to prevent label explosion attacks from malicious discovery messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Metric Accuracy] Can Byzantine validators send crafted discovery messages that cause metrics to be incremented incorrectly, hiding actual network conditions and preventing detection of Sybil attacks or network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Side-Channel Timing] Can the timing resolution of EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S histogram expose nano-second level timing information that enables timing side-channels to infer validator internal state or cryptographic operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Metric Consistency] During validator epoch transitions or reconfiguration, can metric states become inconsistent across validators, causing different nodes to report conflicting discovery statistics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Gauge Staleness] How often is NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH updated, and can stale gauge values persist during key rotation events, allowing window of vulnerability where key mismatches aren't detected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Discovery Module Integration] [Counter Monotonicity] Can DISCOVERY_COUNTS ever decrease or reset (violating counter semantics), potentially hiding security events or causing monitoring alerts to miss attack patterns? (Medium)"
