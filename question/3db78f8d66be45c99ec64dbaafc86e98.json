  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cross-function] [Save/Recover race] Can save_tree() be called while start() is executing recovery, causing the recovery process to use a mix of old and new data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cross-function] [Prune/Save race] If prune_tree() executes between save_tree() saving blocks and QCs, can it delete the blocks before QCs are saved, corrupting the relationship? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cross-function] [Vote/Recovery race] Can save_vote() be called during start() recovery, causing the last_vote to be overwritten with an older vote? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cryptography] [QC signatures] Does the code validate QuorumCert signatures during recovery, or does it trust whatever is in ConsensusDB allowing forged QCs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cryptography] [Vote signatures] Are vote signatures validated before save_vote(), or can unsigned/invalid votes be persisted and used to claim validator equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cryptography] [TC signatures] Does save_highest_2chain_timeout_cert() validate the timeout certificate has proper quorum signatures, or can forged TCs be saved? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Cryptography] [LedgerInfo signatures] Are LedgerInfoWithSignatures validated for signature correctness during recovery_from_ledger(), or blindly trusted from storage? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Integer overflow] [Round comparison] Can round values near u64::MAX cause comparison operations to wrap around, breaking consensus ordering invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Memory exhaustion] [Block vector] Can an attacker fill ConsensusDB with millions of blocks, causing the blocks vector in start() to consume all memory and crash the validator? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Memory exhaustion] [QC vector] Can malicious QC storage cause the quorum_certs vector to grow unbounded, leading to OOM during recovery? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/persistent_liveness_storage.rs] [Error handling] [Partial recovery] If find_root() succeeds but blocks are corrupted, can the validator start with partial data and participate incorrectly in consensus? (Critical)",
