  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [JSON Injection] Can the #[derive(Serialize)] on FilterError and FilterStepTrace produce JSON output containing unescaped control characters that could exploit JSON parsers in downstream systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/errors.rs] [Function: Serialize (SerializableError)] [Custom Serialization] Does the custom Serialize implementation for SerializableError properly handle all error types, or can certain error variants cause serialization failures or expose internal pointers? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
