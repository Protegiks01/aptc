  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::strategy()] [FungibleStore forced] Always creates FungibleStore accounts with concurrent_balance=false - does this miss testing CoinStore code paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::strategy()] [Balance strategy unbounded] If balance_strategy allows extreme values (0 or u64::MAX), can this trigger overflow in balance arithmetic during property testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: Account] [Private key exposure] The privkey field is public - can external code accidentally or maliciously read private keys from Account instances, compromising security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: Account] [Clone implementation] Account derives Clone - can cloning cause private key material to be duplicated in memory, increasing attack surface for key extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: TransactionBuilder] [Builder reuse] Can TransactionBuilder be reused after sign() is called, allowing one builder to create multiple transactions with different signatures but same sequence number? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: TransactionBuilder] [Partial modification] Can fields be modified after raw() but before sign(), causing signature to cover different transaction data than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: new_event_handle()] [Event key collision] Does EventKey::new(count, address) guarantee uniqueness, or can different counts or addresses produce colliding event keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: new_event_handle()] [Event sequence reset] EventHandle is created with sequence number 0 - can this cause event ordering issues if handles are recreated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: CoinStore] [Event handle mutability] Are deposit_events and withdraw_events mutable, and can external code increment counts without actual deposits/withdrawals to forge event history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Struct: FungibleStore] [Owner vs metadata confusion] Can mismatched owner and metadata addresses cause authorization bypass where owner of metadata controls the fungible store? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::to_bytes()] [Sequence number rollback] Can to_bytes() be called with old sequence_number after increment_sequence_number(), allowing sequence number rollback attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: AccountData::increment_sequence_number()] [Unchecked addition] Uses += without overflow checking - in release builds without overflow checks, can this silently wrap causing replay vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: CoinStore::new()] [Balance arithmetic assumptions] Code assumes balance operations are checked elsewhere - can unchecked arithmetic in coin field cause silent overflow during testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: FungibleStore::new()] [Balance vs concurrent balance] If balance is u64::MAX and concurrent_balance is false, can balance operations overflow when this is later migrated to concurrent balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::raw()] [Gas amount default] Default max_gas_amount of 500_000 - can this be too low for complex transactions, causing legitimate transactions to fail, or too high enabling DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation/src/account.rs] [Function: TransactionBuilder::raw()] [Gas price default] Default gas_unit_price of 0 - does this allow free transactions in tests that leak into production configurations? (Medium)"
