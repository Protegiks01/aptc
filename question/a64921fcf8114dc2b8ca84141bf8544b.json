(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/bls12381.rs] [Function: signature_verify()] [Pairing security] The comment mentions 2 bilinear pairings at line 180 - are these pairings computed with constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks that could leak validator private keys? (Medium)",
