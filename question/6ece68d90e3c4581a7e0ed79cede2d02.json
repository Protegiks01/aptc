  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [SSRF via target_url] The target_url from the API provider is repeated repeat_target_count times without sanitization - can an attacker inject internal URLs (e.g., 'http://169.254.169.254/') to perform SSRF attacks against cloud metadata services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [URL duplication DoS] The targets vector duplicates target_url by repeat_target_count - if this count is extremely large, can it cause memory exhaustion or connection pool exhaustion when Cluster::try_from_cluster_args() attempts to connect to all targets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Redirect chain exploitation] The build_path() call might follow HTTP redirects - can a malicious target node redirect the checker to attacker-controlled URLs that return fake chain IDs or manipulated API responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Error message information leakage] When API query fails, the error is formatted with {:#} which includes full error chains - can this leak sensitive information like internal IP addresses, private keys, or system paths in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Enum: TpsCheckerError] [is_retryable() logic error] The is_retryable() method returns true for TransactionEmitterError but false for others - can an attacker exploit this to force infinite retry loops by triggering specific error types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Enum: TpsCheckerError] [InsufficientSubmittedTransactionsError disclosure] This error exposes the minimum_tps requirement in error messages - can attackers use this information to craft targeted attacks that just barely exceed the threshold? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Build result description leakage] The evaluation_result description includes detailed TPS metrics and node requirements link - can this information disclosure help attackers identify vulnerable nodes or checker configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Error context unwrapping] Multiple .unwrap() calls exist (e.g., build_path().unwrap()) - can controlled API responses trigger panics that crash the checker and deny service to legitimate node operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Race condition in async check] The check() method is async but doesn't use any synchronization primitives - if called concurrently on the same TpsChecker instance, can race conditions cause corrupted state or double-minting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Async cancellation vulnerability] If the check() future is cancelled mid-execution (e.g., via timeout), are transactions already emitted but not yet counted properly cleaned up, or do they remain pending and potentially exploitable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Parallel cluster execution] The Cluster is created with multiple repeated targets - are transaction emissions parallelized, and if so, can race conditions in sequence number allocation cause transaction collisions or nonce reuse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider state mutation] The target_api_index_provider.provide() call might mutate internal provider state - can concurrent check() calls cause race conditions in the provider leading to incorrect chain IDs or stale data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [API response forgery] The chain_id comes from target_api_index_provider without signature verification - can a compromised or Byzantine target node return an arbitrary chain ID to redirect funds or bypass checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Stats manipulation by target] The stats object returned from emit_transactions_with_cluster() relies on target node responses - can a malicious node lie about committed transaction counts to inflate its TPS rating? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider trust boundary] The target_api_index_provider is obtained via macro without validation - can an attacker substitute a malicious provider implementation that returns controlled responses for all queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Ledger info manipulation] If the API provider relies on ledger_info endpoints, can a target node return fake block heights or timestamps to manipulate rate calculations in stats.rate()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Memory exhaustion via repeat_target_count] Creating a vector with repeat_target_count copies of target_url can consume excessive memory - can an attacker set this to millions to cause OOM crashes in the checker? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Connection exhaustion] The Cluster::try_from_cluster_args() creates REST clients for all repeated targets - can this exhaust file descriptors or connection pools if repeat_target_count is very large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Transaction spam amplification] The emit_transactions_with_cluster() sends many transactions based on emit_config - can an attacker configure extreme transaction rates that overwhelm the target node or the checker's own resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Timeout absence] The check() function has no explicit timeout - can a slow or malicious target node cause the checker to hang indefinitely, denying service to other node checks in the queue? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Rate calculation gaming] The comparison checks both rate.submitted and rate.committed separately - can a node pass by having high submitted but low committed, or vice versa, to game the evaluation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Stats object poisoning] The stats.rate() function is called to get rate, but stats.committed and stats.submitted are also accessed - can inconsistent data in the stats object cause contradictory pass/fail results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Perfect TPS gaming] The code has special handling when stats.committed == stats.submitted - can a target node ensure perfect equality to trigger the 'theoretically higher TPS' message and bypass scrutiny? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Threshold boundary exploitation] The minimum_tps check uses '<' not '<=' - can a node with rate.committed exactly equal to minimum_tps fail validation despite meeting the requirement? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Float precision loss] Converting minimum_tps (u64) to f64 and back can lose precision for very large values - can this precision loss cause incorrect pass/fail determinations for high-TPS requirements? (Low)"
