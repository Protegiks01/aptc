  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing validation] Is there any validation to prevent max_network_channel_size from being set to 0, which would create a zero-capacity channel causing all DKG messages to be immediately dropped and resulting in complete DKG protocol failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing validation] Can an attacker with configuration file access set max_network_channel_size to 1, causing severe message dropping during DKG transcript exchanges and potentially preventing threshold achievement for DKG completion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Resource exhaustion] Is there an upper bound validation on max_network_channel_size to prevent an attacker from setting it to usize::MAX (18 quintillion), causing massive memory allocation and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Missing validation] Does the configuration system validate that max_network_channel_size is within reasonable operational bounds (e.g., 10-100000), or can misconfigured values cause subtle DKG protocol failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Integer overflow] When max_network_channel_size is used in arithmetic operations during channel allocation, are there checks to prevent integer overflow if extremely large values are configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Insufficient capacity] Is the default value of 256 for max_network_channel_size sufficient for large validator sets (e.g., 200+ validators), or could high-traffic DKG sessions cause message drops leading to transcript aggregation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Function: default()] [DoS vector] Can an attacker who controls multiple Byzantine validators (< 1/3) flood the DKG network channel with 256+ messages to fill the default buffer and cause legitimate DKG messages from honest validators to be dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Consensus impact] If the default channel size is too small for the network's validator count, could systematic message dropping during DKG prevent the generation of randomness, blocking randomness-dependent consensus features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Configuration drift] Are all validators required to use the same max_network_channel_size value, or could heterogeneous configurations across the network create inconsistent message dropping patterns affecting DKG protocol safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Configuration injection] While deny_unknown_fields prevents unknown field injection, can an attacker craft a malicious YAML/TOML configuration file with valid but dangerous max_network_channel_size values that pass deserialization but cause runtime failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Type confusion] Does the serde deserialization properly validate that max_network_channel_size is parsed as a valid usize, or can negative values in signed integer format cause underflow and wrap to extremely large values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Parsing errors] If deserialization fails due to invalid max_network_channel_size format, does the system fall back to default() or crash, and could this be exploited to cause validator node failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Message dropping] When the DKG network channel reaches max_network_channel_size capacity, messages are silently dropped with FIFO eviction - can Byzantine validators exploit this by message flooding to drop critical honest validator DKG transcripts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Protocol safety] If DKG transcript messages from honest validators are dropped due to channel overflow, could this prevent reaching the 2f+1 threshold needed for transcript aggregation, breaking DKG protocol safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Liveness attack] Can an attacker cause channel overflow during critical DKG phases (dealer broadcasting transcripts) to systematically drop messages and prevent DKG completion, blocking randomness generation indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Byzantine exploitation] If max_network_channel_size is set too low, can f Byzantine validators (where 3f+1 is total) coordinate to send f×max_network_channel_size messages to guarantee dropping of honest validator messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Asymmetric message dropping] Does the FIFO queue style used with this channel size cause older DKG messages to be dropped first, and could this create timing-based attacks where late-arriving Byzantine messages displace earlier honest messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Configuration tampering] If an attacker gains write access to the node configuration file, can they set max_network_channel_size to an attack-optimized value (e.g., exactly matching expected honest message volume) to maximize message dropping impact? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Persistent DoS] Can an attacker modify max_network_channel_size in persistent storage to cause long-term degradation of DKG protocol performance across node restarts without immediate detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Struct: DKGConfig] [Configuration inconsistency] If different validators use different max_network_channel_size values, could this create asymmetric network behavior where some validators consistently drop more messages than others, affecting DKG fairness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Threshold calculation] Is max_network_channel_size coordinated with DKG protocol parameters (number of dealers, transcript size, aggregation threshold), or can mismatches cause protocol failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Epoch transition] During DKG execution at epoch boundaries, can channel overflow due to insufficient max_network_channel_size cause epoch transition delays or failures affecting consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Validator set scaling] As the validator set grows from 100 to 200+ validators, does max_network_channel_size scale appropriately, or will O(n²) message complexity during DKG overwhelm fixed-size channels? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [Message size interaction] Does max_network_channel_size account for variable DKG message sizes (transcript size depends on validator count), or could large transcripts cause fewer messages to be buffered than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dkg_config.rs] [Field: max_network_channel_size] [RPC vs DirectSend] The DKG network uses both RPC and DirectSend protocols - does max_network_channel_size apply uniformly, or could protocol-specific buffer handling create vulnerabilities? (Medium)"
