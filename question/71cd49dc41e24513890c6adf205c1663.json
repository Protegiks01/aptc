  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [AbstractValueSize overflow] What is the maximum value of AbstractValueSize type, and can accumulated gas calculations exceed this causing wraparound? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [NumArgs overflow] Can NumArgs::new(vals.len() as u64) overflow when processing vectors with more than u64::MAX elements on 128-bit systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Multiplication overflow] Are all 'params * NumArgs' multiplications checked for overflow, or can they silently wrap? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Addition overflow] Are all 'size += value' additions checked for overflow to prevent gas undercharging? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Subtraction underflow] Besides the explicit checked_sub in abstract_heap_size, are there other subtractions that could underflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Type conversion safety] Are all 'as u64' casts safe from truncation or sign extension issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Zero division] Are there any calculations that could divide by zero if gas parameters are set to zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Empty vectors] How are empty vectors (len=0) handled in packed vector calculations, and is the gas cost correct? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/misc.rs] [Global] [Maximum length vectors] What happens with vectors at maximum length (usize::MAX or u64::MAX), and can this cause overflow? (High)"
