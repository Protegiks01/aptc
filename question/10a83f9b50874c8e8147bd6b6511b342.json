(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Timestamp overflow] Can BCS deserialization produce timestamp_usecs values that overflow when converted to system time types, causing time-travel attacks or negative time comparisons in consensus timeout logic?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_info/mod.rs] [Schema: BlockInfoSchema] [Key ordering guarantees] Does RocksDB guarantee that BlockHeight keys are stored in ascending order, or can key collisions or hash-based indexing cause blocks to be retrieved out of order, violating chain history linearity?
