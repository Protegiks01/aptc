  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger repeated timeout expirations by controlling the remote endpoint, forcing validators to consume excessive resources checking unreachable nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Timeout precision] Does the tokio::time::timeout properly handle sub-millisecond precision or very large timeout values without causing panics or incorrect timeout behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Connection leak] If the timeout fires during the handshake, is the TCP connection properly closed, or are file descriptors leaked causing eventual validator crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Async cancellation] When timeout cancels the async check_endpoint_wrapper, are all resources (sockets, buffers, crypto state) properly cleaned up or can this cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Timeout race] Can a race condition between timeout expiration and successful handshake completion cause the connection to be both marked as successful and failed simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Default timeout] Is the 5-second default timeout appropriate for all network conditions, or can slow but legitimate validators be incorrectly marked as unreachable, affecting validator set composition? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Chain ID confusion] Can an attacker connect to mainnet validators using testnet chain_id to bypass security checks, potentially replaying testnet transactions on mainnet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Network ID mismatch] Does the function properly validate that the network_id in the handshake matches the expected network, or can an attacker connect to Private validators using Public network credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Cross-chain attack] Can malformed chain_id values cause integer overflow or type confusion that allows transactions from one Aptos chain to be replayed on another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Network isolation breach] Is the NetworkId::Public default secure, or does it allow unauthorized connections to validator-only networks that should use NetworkId::Validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Genesis mismatch] Can an attacker provide a valid but different chain_id from a forked Aptos network to cause validators to accept blocks from the wrong chain, leading to chain split? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Network enumeration] Does the function leak information about which network_id values are accepted, allowing attackers to enumerate all private networks in the validator set? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Peer ID bypass] Does the comment 'The peer id doesn't matter because we don't validate it' mean that validators accept connections from any peer_id, allowing complete impersonation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Identity mismatch] Can an attacker provide a public key that hashes to a legitimate validator's peer_id but is actually controlled by the attacker, bypassing authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Peer ID collision] Is the account_address::from_identity_public_key function resistant to collision attacks where different public keys produce the same peer_id? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Validator impersonation] Can a Byzantine validator use the lack of peer_id validation to impersonate other validators and inject false consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Sybil attack] Without proper peer_id validation, can an attacker create multiple fake identities to overwhelm validator connections and partition the network? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_endpoint()] [Authentication bypass] When no_handshake is true, does the function skip all cryptographic authentication, allowing any attacker to connect and potentially inject malicious data into validators? (Critical)",
