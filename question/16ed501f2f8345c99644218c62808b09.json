  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/resolver.rs] [Trait: AptosMoveResolver] [Trait composition vulnerability] Can a malicious implementation provide conflicting behaviors across the multiple supertrait bounds (AggregatorV1Resolver, ConfigStorage, DelayedFieldResolver, ResourceResolver, ResourceGroupResolver, StateStorageView, TableResolver, AsExecutorView, AsResourceGroupView), allowing an attacker to bypass security checks in one trait by exploiting inconsistencies in another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/resolver.rs] [Trait: AptosMoveResolver] [Type confusion attack] Does the AptosMoveResolver trait enforce that all bound traits operate on the same StateKey type consistently, or can an attacker exploit type coercion between different key types to access unauthorized state or bypass access controls?
