  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: build_locally_verified_script()] [Script verifier bypass] Do scripts use the same verifier_config as modules, or can differences in verification strictness allow scripts to bypass checks that modules must pass? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/environment.rs] [Function: deserialize_into_compiled_module()] [Magic number bypass] Does deserializer_config properly validate the bytecode magic number and version, or can an attacker submit bytecode from incompatible Move versions that causes undefined behavior? (High)",
