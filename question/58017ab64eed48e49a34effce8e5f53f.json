  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: new()] [State Initialization] Can an attacker exploit the order of builtins::declare_builtins() initialization to inject malicious builtin functions before legitimate ones are registered, potentially causing type confusion in subsequent module compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilder] [Symbol Table Collision] Does the use of separate BTreeMaps (spec_fun_table, fun_table, const_table) at lines 39-58 properly prevent namespace collisions, or can an attacker define a spec function with the same qualified name as a Move function to shadow legitimate implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilder] [Table Consistency] Can the reverse_struct_table (line 51) become desynchronized from struct_table during concurrent updates, leading to type resolution errors that could bypass security checks in the Move VM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilder] [Memory Exhaustion] Are there bounds on the size of spec_fun_table entries (line 39) since overloading allows Vec<SpecOrBuiltinFunEntry>, or can an attacker create unbounded overloads causing memory exhaustion during model building? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Field: unused_schema_set] [Resource Leak] Does the unused_schema_set at line 46 get properly cleared between module compilations, or can it accumulate entries causing memory leaks in long-running compiler processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_or_builtin_fun()] [Name Clash Detection] At line 286, the function checks fun_table.contains_key() but only reports an error without preventing insertion - can an attacker exploit this to define spec functions that shadow Move functions after the error is reported? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_or_builtin_fun()] [Overload Validation] The TODO comment at line 295 states 'check whether overloads are distinguishable' - can an attacker create ambiguous overloaded spec functions with identical signatures to cause non-deterministic function resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_or_builtin_fun()] [Entry Mutation] After pushing to spec_fun_table.entry().or_default() at line 296, can subsequent modifications to the SpecOrBuiltinFunEntry affect already-compiled modules that reference this function? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_or_builtin_fun()] [Type Parameter Constraints] Does the function validate that type_param_constraints in SpecOrBuiltinFunEntry (line 73) are satisfiable, or can contradictory constraints cause type checker crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_var()] [Duplicate Detection Race] At lines 316-320, duplicate detection uses insert() which returns the old value - can concurrent calls to define_spec_var with the same name cause one error message to reference a not-yet-committed entry? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_var()] [Variable Shadowing] Does define_spec_var prevent shadowing of builtin variables or constants, or can an attacker define a spec variable named 'old' or other reserved names to interfere with specification semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_var()] [Type Validation] Is the Type parameter at line 307 validated before storage, or can an attacker pass Type::Error or malformed types that crash downstream type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_var()] [Module ID Consistency] Can the module_id parameter at line 304 reference a module that hasn't been fully initialized, causing dangling references when the spec variable is later resolved? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_schema()] [Double Error Reporting] At lines 342-351, why are there two separate error() calls for duplicate schemas instead of error_with_notes(), and can this cause user confusion leading to incorrect fixes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_schema()] [Unused Set Consistency] The function inserts into unused_schema_set at line 353 but doesn't check if it was already there - can schema redefinition cause the set to lose track of which schemas are truly unused? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_schema()] [Uninitialized Fields] The SpecSchemaEntry created at lines 332-341 initializes spec, all_vars, and included_spec as empty - can these be accessed before being properly populated, causing panics in schema resolution logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_spec_schema()] [Type Parameter Validation] Are type_params at line 329 validated for uniqueness and proper bounds, or can duplicate or unbounded type parameters cause type system inconsistencies? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_struct()] [Visibility Validation] At lines 370-381, structs with Key ability cannot have public/package/friend visibility - but does this check occur before or after the struct is added to struct_table, and can partially-defined structs be exploited?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_struct()] [Ability Validation] Does the function validate that abilities in AbilitySet at line 364 are consistent with the struct's type parameters and fields, or can an attacker declare a struct with Copy+Key abilities simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_struct()] [Layout Consistency] Can the StructLayout parameter at line 366 be StructLayout::None for non-native structs, causing downstream code that expects fields to panic when accessing the layout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_struct()] [Reverse Table Atomicity] The insert operations at lines 395-397 are not atomic - can a failure between the two inserts leave struct_table and reverse_struct_table inconsistent, breaking type resolution?
