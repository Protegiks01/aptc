  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious output_file path like '../../../etc/passwd' or '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' to overwrite critical system files when error maps are generated, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the build system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Does the output_file validation prevent absolute paths (e.g., '/tmp/malicious_errmap') that could write error maps outside the intended project directory, potentially exposing sensitive error information to unauthorized users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symbolic link at the output_file location before execution, causing the error map to be written to an arbitrary file the build process has write access to, potentially corrupting critical configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [TOCTOU Race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between when output_file path is validated and when move_errmapgen writes to it, allowing an attacker to swap the target file and cause unintended overwrites during parallel builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Directory Traversal] Does reroot_path properly validate that the resolved package root is within expected boundaries, or can malicious Move.toml files with crafted paths cause the CLI to operate on arbitrary directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Struct: Errmap] [Input Injection] Can error_prefix contain malicious characters (newlines, null bytes, shell metacharacters) that get injected into generated error map files, potentially causing command injection when these files are processed by downstream tools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Struct: Errmap] [Path Injection] Does output_file accept Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., U+202E right-to-left override) that could disguise malicious file extensions, causing '.exe' files to appear as '.txt' and bypass security scanners? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can error_prefix be set to an extremely long string (megabytes) causing memory exhaustion when move_errmapgen processes every error constant, leading to denial of service on build systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Unicode Validation] Does error_prefix properly validate Unicode input, or can malicious Unicode sequences (combining characters, zero-width characters) corrupt error map generation and cause parsing failures in error explanation tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Struct: Errmap] [Integer Overflow] If output_file path length approaches system limits (e.g., PATH_MAX), does with_extension() cause integer overflow or truncation when appending MOVE_ERROR_DESC_EXTENSION, potentially writing to incorrect file paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Arbitrary File Write] Does move_errmapgen's save_result() validate write permissions before overwriting output_file, or can it silently fail or overwrite read-only files with elevated privileges, corrupting version-controlled error maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [File Descriptor Leak] If move_errmapgen.gen() fails partway through processing, does save_result() still execute and potentially leave corrupted/partial error map files that could be committed to source control? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Atomic Write Failure] Does save_result() perform atomic file writes (write to temp, then rename), or can build process crashes leave partially written error maps that break error explanation tooling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Information Disclosure] Does the error map generation log or expose sensitive paths, module names, or error messages that could reveal internal implementation details to attackers analyzing build artifacts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can malicious Move modules with millions of error constants cause error map files to grow unboundedly, exhausting disk space on build servers and causing CI/CD pipeline failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Model Poisoning] Can a malicious Move package craft dependencies that cause config.move_model_for_package() to include untrusted code paths, potentially executing malicious build scripts during error map generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Build Config Tampering] Does BuildConfig validation ensure ModelConfig parameters (all_files_as_targets, compiler_version, language_version) cannot be manipulated to process unintended files or use vulnerable compiler versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Compiler Version Confusion] Is CompilerVersion::default() guaranteed to use a secure/stable compiler, or can environment manipulation force usage of outdated compilers with known bugs during error map generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Language Version Downgrade] Can LanguageVersion::default() be influenced by malicious Move.toml configurations to force use of deprecated language versions with known security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Infinite Loop in Model Building] Can circular dependencies or recursive module structures cause move_model_for_package() to enter infinite loops, hanging build systems indefinitely? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic Propagation] Can malicious input cause unwrap() calls in reroot_path (line 21 of mod.rs) to panic and crash the CLI without proper error messages, hiding attack attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Context Loss] When canonicalize() fails on invalid paths, does the error message expose enough information for security monitoring to detect attack attempts, or is it too generic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Stack Overflow] Can deeply nested Move module dependencies cause recursive model building to overflow the stack during error map generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/errmap.rs] [Function: execute()] [Working Directory Race] Since reroot_path calls set_current_dir(), can concurrent errmap executions in different threads cause race conditions where error maps are generated in wrong directories? (High)"
