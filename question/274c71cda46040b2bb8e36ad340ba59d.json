  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/loaded_data/runtime_types.rs] [Ability: Phantom type masking] Can phantom type parameters be used to hide resource types inside structs with abilities, bypassing resource safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/loaded_data/runtime_types.rs] [Ability: Vector ability inheritance] Can vector ability calculation be exploited to create vectors of restricted types that shouldn't have certain abilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/loaded_data/runtime_types.rs] [Ability: Polymorphic ability error] Can errors in AbilitySet::polymorphic_abilities be ignored or mishandled, causing incorrect ability determination? (High)",
