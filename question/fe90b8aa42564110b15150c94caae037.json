  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Alert Fatigue] Can an attacker deliberately trigger high volumes of 500 errors to flood error logs and cause alert fatigue, masking real attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Log Tampering] If an attacker gains access to log storage, can they modify or delete middleware logs to hide their attack trail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: HISTOGRAM] [Metrics Poisoning] Can an attacker send carefully crafted requests that create histogram buckets with extreme outlier values, making normal request latencies appear anomalous? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: RESPONSE_STATUS] [Alert Evasion] Can attackers stay just below alerting thresholds by distributing attacks across different status codes and endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Memory Leak] If DropLogger is never dropped due to a memory leak, can this cause unbounded memory growth over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: HttpRequestLog] [String Allocation] Can attackers send requests with maximum-length headers to cause excessive string allocations and memory pressure? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: REJECTION_REASONS] [Counter Overflow] Even though IntCounter is 64-bit, can an attacker trigger enough rejections over time to overflow the counter? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Environment Variable Poisoning] Can attackers manipulate environment variables in containerized deployments to inject false POD_NAME values into logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Proxy Misconfiguration] If the faucet is deployed behind a misconfigured reverse proxy, can RealIp extraction fail systematically, breaking all IP-based security controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [TLS Termination] If TLS is terminated at the proxy layer, can the middleware properly extract client IPs, or will all requests appear to come from the proxy IP? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Sampling Timing Attack] Can attackers exploit the 60-second sampling window for root endpoint to make precise timed attacks that avoid detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Sampling Bias] Does the sampling of root endpoint requests create blind spots in monitoring where attacks could go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: DropLogger] [Unsafe Code] Does any unsafe code block in the Poem framework or dependencies compromise the safety guarantees of this middleware? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: HttpResponseLog] [Lifetime Soundness] Can the 'a lifetime parameter in HttpResponseLog be incorrectly extended, causing use-after-free bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: HISTOGRAM] [Static Initialization] Can the lazy_static initialization order cause issues if metrics are accessed before full initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [URI Validation] Is request.uri().path() properly validated and sanitized before logging, or can it contain dangerous characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Method Validation] Can non-standard HTTP methods bypass certain security checks while still being logged? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: HttpRequestLog] [Schema Validation] Does the #[derive(Schema)] attribute properly validate all field constraints, or can invalid data be logged? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Impl: Drop for DropLogger] [Debug Information Leakage] Can the structured logging reveal internal implementation details that help attackers understand the system architecture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: NUM_OUTSTANDING_TRANSACTIONS] [Monitoring Blind Spot] If this gauge is not properly decremented when transactions complete, can it create false positives that hide real issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/metrics.rs] [Static: TRANSFER_FUNDER_ACCOUNT_BALANCE] [Monitoring Coverage] Is this gauge updated atomically with actual balance changes, or can race conditions create temporary inconsistencies that mask fund drain attacks? (High)",
