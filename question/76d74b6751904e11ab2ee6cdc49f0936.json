  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Premature deletion] Can transaction auxiliary data be deleted before all validators have synchronized the corresponding transactions, causing nodes that are catching up to be unable to retrieve detailed error information for historical transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Critical data loss] If transaction auxiliary data contains critical debugging information for transaction failures, can aggressive pruning delete this data before it's been analyzed, making it impossible to diagnose Byzantine behavior or consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Orphaned references] After pruning auxiliary data for versions [current_progress..target_version), can other database components still hold references to the deleted data, causing null pointer errors or panics when they try to access it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Merkle tree inconsistency] Does pruning transaction auxiliary data affect any Merkle tree proofs or state commitments? If the auxiliary data is part of the state commitment but gets pruned, could this prevent historical state verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Checkpoint corruption] If a database checkpoint is created while prune() is executing write_schemas(), could the checkpoint contain inconsistent state where some auxiliary data is deleted but the progress metadata still reflects the old state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Schema version mismatch] If the DbMetadataSchema or TransactionAuxiliaryDataSchema format changes between Aptos versions, can the pruner correctly deserialize and delete old-format data, or could schema mismatches cause deletion failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [BCS encoding issues] Since DbMetadataValue uses BCS encoding for Version, can integer endianness issues or BCS version incompatibilities cause the target_version to be serialized incorrectly in batch.put()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Key encoding collision] Could crafted Version values cause BCS encoding collisions where different version numbers produce the same encoded key, causing the wrong auxiliary data entries to be deleted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Malformed metadata] If DbMetadataValue::Version(target_version) is corrupted in the database, can subsequent reads via expect_version() cause panics that crash the pruner or validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Schema migration] During a database schema migration, if TransactionAuxiliaryDataPrunerProgress metadata is lost or reset to 0, could the pruner attempt to delete already-pruned data causing errors or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Unauthorized deletion] Can external code with access to a TransactionAuxiliaryDataPruner instance call prune() with arbitrary version ranges, bypassing the intended pruning policy and causing premature data deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Privilege escalation] Since new() is pub(in crate::pruner), can code outside the pruner module gain access to create pruner instances with arbitrary metadata_progress values, potentially manipulating pruning behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Struct: TransactionAuxiliaryDataPruner] [Direct DB access] Does the pruner have exclusive write access to transaction_auxiliary_data_db, or can other components concurrently write auxiliary data while pruning is in progress, causing race conditions?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Metadata tampering] Can malicious code directly modify DbMetadataKey::TransactionAuxiliaryDataPrunerProgress in the database to trick the pruner into deleting unintended version ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: name()] [Name collision] If multiple pruner instances return the same name from name(), could this cause issues with metrics, logging, or pruner coordination where operations get attributed to the wrong pruner?
