  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Public Key Recovery] When recovering pk_shares from the transcript, can a corrupted transcript cause all validators to derive different public key shares, breaking randomness verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [RNG Seeding] Does StdRng::from_rng(thread_rng()) provide sufficient entropy for augmented key generation, or could weak randomness make keys predictable? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: try_get_rand_config_for_new_epoch()] [Key Recovery Logic] When recovering existing augmented keys, is there validation that the epoch matches current epoch, or could stale keys from a previous epoch be reused? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_message()] [Epoch Confusion] Can a Byzantine peer send messages with slightly incorrect epochs (e.g., current_epoch + 1) to trigger unnecessary epoch retrieval requests and DoS the network? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: process_message()] [Fail Point Injection] The fail_point 'consensus::process::any' can inject errors - is this fail point properly secured in production builds to prevent malicious activation? (Low)",

  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: check_epoch()] [Epoch Ordering Attack] Can an attacker send EpochChangeProof for epoch X followed by consensus messages for epoch X+2, skipping epoch X+1 and causing validators to have inconsistent state? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: check_epoch()] [UnverifiedEvent Conversion] When converting ConsensusMsg to UnverifiedEvent, are all message fields properly validated or can malformed messages cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Function: check_epoch()] [Wrong Epoch Counter] When incrementing EPOCH_MANAGER_ISSUES_DETAILS counter for 'epoch_proof_wrong_epoch', does this create observable side effects that an attacker can use for timing attacks? (Low)",
