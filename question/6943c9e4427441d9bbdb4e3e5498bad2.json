  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache::total_size()] [Consistency] Can total_size() return different values for caches with identical contents due to implementation differences, causing validator behavior divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Traits: SizedCache & Cache] [Interface Mismatch] Can a type implement both SizedCache and Cache traits with conflicting semantics for get() or total_size(), causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Traits: SizedCache & Cache] [Type Constraint Conflict] Do the different type constraints (SizedCache has no constraints on K, Cache requires K: Eq + Hash) prevent proper interoperability between the traits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Generic: K, V] [Type Confusion] Can attackers exploit the lack of size constraints on generic parameters K and V to insert extremely large types that cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Generic: K, V] [Lifetime Issues] Are there missing lifetime bounds that could allow dangling references or use-after-free vulnerabilities in cache implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Generic: K, V] [Drop Safety] Can custom Drop implementations on K or V cause panics or unsafe behavior during cache eviction, leading to validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Eviction Policy] Does the trait contract specify when and how eviction occurs, or can implementations use arbitrary eviction policies that cause non-deterministic cache behavior across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Key Uniqueness] Does the trait guarantee that each key maps to at most one value, or can implementations allow key collisions that cause cache poisoning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Size Semantics] Does size_in_bytes represent logical size, physical memory size, or serialized size, and can ambiguity lead to incorrect capacity management? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache] [Insert Semantics] Does insert() replace existing values or fail on duplicate keys, and can ambiguous semantics cause state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Memory Ordering] Are there memory ordering guarantees for operations, or can weak ordering cause visibility issues where updates on one thread are not seen by others? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Linearizability] Do cache operations appear to execute atomically, or can non-linearizable behavior cause validators to observe different operation orderings? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Deadlock] Can implementations using multiple locks cause deadlocks when concurrent operations access overlapping cache entries? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Observable State] Does the trait provide methods to observe cache state for debugging, and can such methods be exploited for timing attacks or state inference? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Memory Amplification] Can an attacker insert small keys that reference large values, bypassing size-based eviction and causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache] [Unbounded Growth] Does the Cache trait lack capacity management, allowing unbounded cache growth that exhausts validator memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Eviction Storm] Can an attacker trigger cascading evictions by inserting entries that cause the total size to exceed capacity limits repeatedly? (Medium)",
