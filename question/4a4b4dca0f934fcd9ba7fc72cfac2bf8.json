  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input Validation] Does the BytecodeViewerConfig::parse() call validate command-line arguments to prevent path traversal attacks when specifying --module-path, --source-map-path, or --source-path parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic Handling] The main function calls start_viewer() without error handling - can malformed input cause panics that leak sensitive file system information through error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Dependency Chain] The function chains BytecodeViewerConfig::parse().start_viewer() - are there unhandled error conditions in this call chain that could lead to undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer()] [File System Access] The start_viewer() method uses fs::read() with .expect() - can an attacker provide paths to sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) and have them read by the tool? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer()] [Deserialization] CompiledModule::deserialize() is called on user-provided bytecode_bytes - can maliciously crafted bytecode exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to cause crashes or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer()] [Resource Exhaustion] When deserializing CompiledModule from untrusted files, are there limits on module size or complexity that could prevent memory exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer()] [Error Messages] The .expect() calls expose internal file paths - could this leak information about the developer's file system structure to an attacker who controls error output? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer()] [Path Validation] Does the function validate that module_binary_path, module_sourcemap_path, and source_file_path point to expected file types before reading them? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs:start_viewer_in_memory()] [Unwrap Safety] The start_tui_with_interface(interface).unwrap() call will panic on TUI initialization failure - could this be exploited to cause denial of service in automated environments? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/main.rs] [Unsafe Code] The file uses #![forbid(unsafe_code)] - but does this restriction extend to all transitive dependencies that handle bytecode deserialization? (Low)"
