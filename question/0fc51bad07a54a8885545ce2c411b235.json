  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_update_refs.rs] [Function: BatchedStateUpdateRefs::last_version()] [Overflow check] Uses checked_sub(1) on next_version() - can this return None for empty batches, and do callers handle it? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/hot_state.rs] [Function: HotStateLRU::insert_as_head()] [Empty case] When head is None, both head and tail are set to the same key - can this cause issues if immediately followed by deletion? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/hot_state.rs] [Function: HotStateLRU::delete()] [Not hot check] Returns None if slot is not hot - but can this silently hide bugs where hot slots should be present? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/hot_state.rs] [Function: HotStateLRU::maybe_evict()] [Empty check] Checks if tail is None and asserts num_items == 0 - can num_items be non-zero with None tail due to corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state.rs] [Function: LedgerState::is_checkpoint()] [Pointer equality] Uses is_the_same() which checks Arc::ptr_eq() - can this incorrectly return false for valid checkpoints after state cloning? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state.rs] [Function: LedgerState::update_with_memorized_reads()] [Conditional cloning] Clones last_checkpoint or base_of_latest based on conditions - can wrong cloning path be taken due to logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_summary.rs] [Function: LedgerStateSummary::new()] [Ordering assert] Asserts last_checkpoint.next_version() <= latest.next_version() - but can checkpoints be in the future if clock skew occurs? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_summary.rs] [Function: LedgerStateSummary::update()] [Base selection] base_of_latest is conditionally set to latest() or last_checkpoint - can wrong base selection cause incorrect SMT updates? (High)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_with_summary.rs] [Function: StateWithSummary::into_inner()] [Ownership transfer] Consumes self and returns components - can this leave dangling references if components were borrowed elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/state_with_summary.rs] [Function: LedgerStateWithSummary::new_at_checkpoint()] [Self-reference] Clones checkpoint to use as both latest and last_checkpoint - can modifications to one affect the other unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/storage-interface/src/state_store/versioned_state_value.rs] [Function: StateUpdateRef::to_result_slot()] [Clone semantics] Clones state_op which may contain large StateValue - can this cause memory pressure during mass updates? (Low)"
