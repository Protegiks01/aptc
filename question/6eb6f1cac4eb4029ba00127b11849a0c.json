  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Struct: Address] [Memory leak] Does the Copy implementation properly handle memory, or can repeated copying of Address values in hot API paths cause memory fragmentation or leaks that degrade performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: FromStr::from_str()] [Stack overflow] Can recursive or deeply nested parsing logic in AccountAddress::from_str() cause stack overflow when processing extremely complex or malformed address strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Serialize::serialize()] [Temporary allocation] Does the to_string() call in Serialize allocate temporary strings that could accumulate in bulk serialization operations, causing memory pressure or OOM conditions during high-traffic periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Struct: Address] [Address derivation] If Address is used in key derivation or signature schemes, can the Copy semantics allow addresses to be duplicated in ways that weaken cryptographic security or enable key reuse attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Hash implementation] [Collision resistance] Does the Hash trait implementation have cryptographic collision resistance, or can attackers find address collisions that map to the same hash, enabling signature replay or authorization bypasses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Eq implementation] [Timing attack] Does the equality comparison run in constant time, or can timing differences reveal information about address prefixes or structure that aids in address grinding or brute force attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Serialize/Deserialize] [Round-trip integrity] Can an Address be serialized and deserialized multiple times without loss of information, or do edge cases exist where round-tripping produces different results, breaking API idempotency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: FromStr + Display] [Inverse relationship] Are FromStr and Display proper inverses, or can some addresses be displayed in a format that cannot be parsed back, creating unrecoverable address representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: to_standard_string()] [Determinism] Is to_standard_string() guaranteed to be deterministic across all platforms, architectures, and library versions, or can subtle differences cause the same Address to have different standard representations on different nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Struct: Address] [Invariant validation] Are there internal invariants that must hold for Address to be valid, and if so, are they enforced in all construction paths (FromStr, From conversions, deserialization)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: inner()] [Mutability escape] Does inner() returning a reference allow callers to create mutable aliases through unsafe code, potentially violating Address invariants or causing memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Debug::fmt()] [Information disclosure] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information about internal Address structure that could aid attackers in reverse engineering address generation or validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Display::fmt()] [Log injection] Can addresses with special formatting be logged in ways that corrupt log files, inject false log entries, or exploit log parsing tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: FromStr::from_str()] [Algorithmic complexity] Does address parsing have linear time complexity, or can specially crafted inputs cause quadratic or exponential parsing time, enabling ReDoS-style attacks on the API? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Serialize::serialize()] [Serialization bomb] Can bulk serialization of Address values in large API responses cause CPU or memory exhaustion, especially if to_string() performs expensive operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: to_standard_string()] [Format conversion cost] Is the conversion to standard string format expensive, and can attackers trigger this conversion repeatedly to cause CPU exhaustion in hot API paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Tests: test_from_and_to_string()] [Insufficient coverage] The test only checks valid addresses '0x1', '0x001', '0x00000000000000000000000000000001' and some invalid formats - are there edge cases like maximum length, special characters, or Unicode that are not tested and could harbor vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Tests: test_from_and_to_json()] [JSON attack vectors] The test only validates a single address '0x1' - are there untested JSON attack vectors like deeply nested objects, extremely long strings, or numeric representations that could bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Tests: Missing] [Race condition testing] Are there no concurrency tests to verify Address behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads simultaneously in the API server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Tests: Missing] [Fuzzing coverage] Have the parsing and serialization functions been fuzz-tested with random inputs to discover crashes, panics, or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: From<Address> for MoveValue] [VM state corruption] When Address is converted to MoveValue and passed to the Move VM, can malformed or specially crafted addresses cause the VM to enter an invalid state, bypass safety checks, or crash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: From<Address> for MoveValue] [Type system bypass] Can the conversion to MoveValue::Address bypass Move's type system checks, allowing addresses to be used in contexts where they should be rejected (e.g., as numbers, resources, or references)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: From<Address> for MoveValue] [Resource safety violation] Does the conversion properly maintain Move's resource safety guarantees, or can it create address values that violate linear typing or ownership rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Display::fmt()] [Version skew] The comment mentions maintaining existing behavior for backward compatibility - can attackers exploit version differences between API servers running different code versions to cause address format inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: to_standard_string()] [Breaking change risk] If AIP-40 compliance is enforced in new API versions, can existing clients break in ways that cause transaction failures, fund loss, or security vulnerabilities when addresses are formatted differently? (High)"
