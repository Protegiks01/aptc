  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Toposort performance] For modules with thousands of structs and complex dependencies, could toposort() take excessive time allowing verification DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [Integer type variants] The code lists U8, U16, U32, U64, U128, U256, I8, I16, I32, I64, I128, I256 - if new integer types are added to SignatureToken, would they be automatically handled or cause match failures? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [Signer type semantics] Signer is treated as a primitive - but could Signer fields have special semantics that should be validated differently? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [Address type validation] Address fields are ignored for cycle checking - is this correct, or could address-based indirection create logical cycles? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_struct_defs()] [field.signature_token() validity] Does signature_token() always return valid tokens, or could corrupted field data return malformed tokens that break matching logic? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: Multiple] [StructDefinitionView field iterator] Could the StructDefinitionView implementation have bugs that cause fields to be skipped, duplicated, or returned in wrong order? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: new()] [StructHandle to StructDefinition mapping] The 1-1 mapping relies on DuplicationChecker - if that checker is bypassed, could multiple definitions share handles breaking graph correctness? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [External struct handle references] When a Struct or StructInstantiation references a handle not in handle_to_def, it's silently ignored - is this safe, or should external dependencies be validated? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Module comment] [Acyclic module dependency] The module comment states 'module dependency graph is acyclic by construction' - but is this guarantee enforced elsewhere, and what if it's violated? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Iterative vs recursive comment] The comment justifies iterative toposort for untrusted data - but is the recursive add_signature_token safe, or could it be exploited? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/struct_defs.rs] [Function: add_signature_token()] [Custom error message] The 'Reference field when checking recursive structs' message is manually constructed - could message injection or formatting issues cause problems? (Low)",
