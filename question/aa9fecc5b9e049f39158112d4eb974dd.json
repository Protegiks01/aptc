  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Retry Logic] Models like ParsedAssetUris contain retry count fields - does public exposure allow attackers to directly manipulate retry counters to bypass rate limiting or cause infinite retry loops that exhaust system resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [URI Validation] The parsed_asset_uris module handles URI parsing - does public model exposure allow attackers to insert ParsedAssetUris entries with malicious URIs (SSRF payloads, file:// schemes, localhost references) that bypass validation in higher layers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Chain ID Integrity] The ledger_info module exposes chain_id tracking - can an attacker with module access modify the chain_id to cause the crawler to accept fraudulent NFT metadata from testnets or malicious chains, polluting the production database? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [CDN URI Manipulation] The asset_uploader_request_statuses module tracks cdn_image_uri values - does public exposure allow attackers to modify CDN URIs in completed requests, redirecting NFT image loads to malicious servers for phishing or malware distribution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Timestamp Manipulation] Query models contain inserted_at and request_received_at timestamps - can attackers with access to these public models manipulate timestamps to bypass time-based access controls, rate limits, or audit logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Initialization] No initialization or setup code exists in this mod.rs - does this mean database connections, schema validation, or security checks must be done elsewhere, potentially allowing attackers to use these models before proper initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Diesel ORM Exposure] The submodules use Diesel ORM - does public module exposure allow attackers to leverage Diesel's query builder directly to construct queries that bypass application-level authorization or exploit ORM-specific vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Status Code Validation] The asset_uploader_request_statuses module stores HTTP status codes as i64 - does public exposure allow attackers to insert invalid status codes (negative values, overflow values) that cause logic errors when processed by other components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Error Message Storage] AssetUploaderRequestStatuses stores error_messages as Option<Vec<Option<String>>> - does this complex nested Option type exposed publicly create deserialization vulnerabilities or allow attackers to inject malicious error messages that execute code when displayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Trait Implementations] Public modules expose structs that implement Diesel traits (Identifiable, Insertable, Queryable) - can attackers exploit these trait implementations to perform operations not intended by the API design, such as bulk insertions or custom queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Dependency Chain] This models module is likely imported by other crawler components - does the public exposure create a dependency chain where compromising any caller grants access to raw database models without authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Concurrent Access] Public model exposure allows multiple components to access database models simultaneously - are there missing synchronization mechanisms that could lead to race conditions when multiple threads modify AssetUploaderRequestStatuses or ParsedAssetUris entries concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/mod.rs] [Module Security Policy] No security attributes, unsafe markers, or documentation exist in this mod.rs - does this lack of security metadata mean developers using these public modules don't understand the trust assumptions or security requirements for proper usage? (Low)"
