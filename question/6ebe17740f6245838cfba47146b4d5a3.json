  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Single-threaded main] The main thread blocks on rx.recv() - if ProcessExecutorService spawns background threads that panic, will the main thread detect this, or will the service appear healthy while execution has stopped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Test: verify_tool, Line 51-54] [Test coverage] Does the verify_tool test validate actual security properties (bounds checking, input validation), or does it only check clap argument parsing syntax without catching security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Missing authentication] Is there any authentication or authorization before ProcessExecutorService accepts commands from coordinator_address or remote_executor_addresses? Can an attacker impersonate the coordinator to manipulate execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [No TLS validation] Are connections to coordinator_address and remote_executor_addresses encrypted and authenticated (TLS with mutual auth), or can network attackers perform MITM attacks to manipulate cross-shard execution messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Missing rate limiting] Is there any rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent a Byzantine coordinator or shard from flooding this executor with requests causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [No health checks] After initialization, how does the coordinator verify this executor is healthy? Could a partially-failed executor continue running causing inconsistent execution results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Restart safety] If the service crashes and restarts with different command-line arguments (different shard_id or num_shards), could this cause the validator to process incorrect transaction partitions leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Cross-shard coordination] How does main.rs ensure all shards start with synchronized configuration? Could shards starting at different times or with skewed clocks cause transaction ordering inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Memory safety] Does ProcessExecutorService use any unsafe Rust code that could be exploited for memory corruption, and is main.rs prepared to handle panics from unsafe blocks in dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Default value exploitation] The default num_executor_threads=8 is used if not specified - is this safe for all deployment environments, or could under-resourced environments (containers with CPU limits) experience thread starvation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Configuration drift] If different validators start executor services with different Args values (different num_shards or num_executor_threads), could this cause deterministic execution differences leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] If ProcessExecutorService::new() panics during construction, does main() have any panic hooks to ensure clean shutdown, or will the process abort leaving uncommitted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [No timeout] The rx.recv() at line 45 blocks indefinitely without timeout - if the shutdown signal is never sent due to bugs in signal handling, will the process hang forever requiring kill -9? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] Errors from ProcessExecutorService initialization are not propagated back to the operating system (no explicit exit code) - could orchestration systems fail to detect startup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall security] [No metrics exposure] There is no explicit metrics or monitoring endpoint initialization in main.rs (though ProcessExecutorService may add it) - could operators be unable to detect performance degradation or attacks in real-time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall security] [Process isolation] Is there any sandboxing, seccomp, or capability dropping after initialization to limit the blast radius if the executor is compromised via memory corruption or dependency vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall security] [Determinism guarantee] How does main.rs ensure the execution environment is deterministic (same file paths, environment variables, syscall behavior) across all validators to prevent state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: remote_executor_addresses] [IPv6 handling] Are IPv6 addresses in SocketAddr properly validated and does the executor handle IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack scenarios without routing or binding issues that could cause network partitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Binary tampering] Is there any integrity check (signature verification) of the binary before execution to prevent malicious operators from running modified executors that inject backdoors or manipulate execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Overall architecture] [Dependency vulnerabilities] Does main.rs have any defense against vulnerabilities in dependencies like crossbeam-channel, clap, or ctrlc that could be exploited for RCE or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [CLI injection via orchestration] If Args are passed programmatically by orchestration tools (Kubernetes, systemd), could argument injection via environment variables or config files bypass intended security restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Zombie process handling] If ProcessExecutorService spawns child processes and main() exits, are children properly reaped, or could zombies accumulate causing resource exhaustion over time? (Low)"
