  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Key ordering] Does the use of BTreeMap imply any ordering guarantees that consuming code might depend on, and can changes to key names break this ordering in security-relevant ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 67-83] [Map capacity] Since the BTreeMap is initialized empty and then filled with ~13 known keys, can the reallocation overhead cause performance issues during frequent build_information calls in hot paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Reference lifetime] Does returning a BTreeMap<String, String> by value create unnecessary clones when consuming code only needs read access, potentially causing memory issues under load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Module dependency] Can vulnerabilities in the shadow_rs crate propagate to Aptos Core through the build_information module, potentially affecting all validators that include this dependency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Std library dependency] Does the use of std::env::var() and std::env!() depend on specific standard library versions, and can incompatibilities cause build information extraction to fail silently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 67-76] [Type coercion] The code uses .into() for string conversion from shadow_rs constants - are these conversions always safe, or can type mismatches cause truncation, corruption, or panics? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Line: 78] [is_release() consistency] Does the is_release() function from shadow_rs produce deterministic results across different build environments, or can compiler optimizations cause inconsistent release detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Non-deterministic builds] Since BUILD_TIME includes exact build timestamps, does this prevent reproducible builds and make it impossible to verify that validator binaries match expected builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Build environment leakage] Can the build information expose details about the build environment (BUILD_OS, BUILD_RUST_VERSION, BUILD_CARGO_VERSION) that aid attackers in reproducing vulnerable build configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 67-76] [Git metadata authenticity] Does the code verify that git metadata from shadow_rs corresponds to the official Aptos repository, or can attacker-controlled git repositories inject malicious version information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Cargo version consistency] Can mismatches between BUILD_CARGO_VERSION and the cargo version used by other validators cause subtle incompatibilities in binary serialization or protocol behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 88-102] [Silent environment override] If std::env::var() returns Ok() for environment variables with empty strings, does the code properly handle empty values or insert them into build_information causing validation issues downstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_git_hash()] [Error handling inconsistency] Why does get_git_hash() use std::env::var() (returns Result) while get_build_information() checks Ok(), and can this inconsistency cause different behavior in error cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Missing validation] Are there any validation checks on the length or format of values inserted into build_information, or can extremely long strings cause issues in storage or transmission? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Lines: 88-102] [Partial override] Can partial environment variable overrides (e.g., only GIT_SHA set but not GIT_BRANCH) create inconsistent metadata states that confuse version comparison logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [Thread safety] Since BTreeMap is created locally in each call, is there any risk of data races if multiple threads call get_build_information() concurrently while environment variables are being modified?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_build_information()] [API stability] Can changes to the keys or values in the returned BTreeMap break consuming code that relies on specific key names or value formats, causing validator incompatibilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Macro: build_information!()] [Macro vs function inconsistency] Since get_build_information() is marked as not recommended in favor of the macro, can code using both get inconsistent results for BUILD_PKG_VERSION causing version confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-build-info/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_git_hash()] [Redundant API] Why does get_git_hash() exist separately when get_build_information() already provides BUILD_COMMIT_HASH, and can this redundancy cause consumers to use mismatched commit hashes? (Low)",
