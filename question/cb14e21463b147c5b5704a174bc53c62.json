  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malformed BCS-encoded bytes with incorrect length prefixes that cause buffer overflows or panics when try_from_bytes() calls bcs::from_bytes(), potentially crashing validator nodes or causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide BCS bytes that deserialize successfully but represent a different struct type, bypassing type safety checks and causing the MaximumMutate event to contain malicious data that corrupts token state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker craft BCS-encoded bytes with extremely large String fields (collection or token names) that consume excessive memory during deserialization, causing OOM crashes in validator nodes processing the event? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does the BCS deserialization properly validate that old_maximum and new_maximum u64 values don't cause arithmetic overflow in downstream calculations when these events are processed by indexers or APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Malformed UTF-8] Can an attacker inject invalid UTF-8 sequences in the collection or token String fields that pass BCS deserialization but cause panics or undefined behavior when these strings are later used in database queries or API responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Denial of service] Can a malicious Move module emit MaximumMutate events with deeply nested or recursive BCS structures that cause exponential time complexity during deserialization, effectively halting event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker set new_maximum to u64::MAX (18446744073709551615) in a malicious event, causing overflow when indexers or analytics systems calculate supply changes (new_maximum - old_maximum), leading to incorrect reporting or database corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Integer underflow] If old_maximum is greater than new_maximum, can this cause underflow when systems calculate the delta without proper validation, potentially corrupting token supply tracking in off-chain databases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Edge case] Can an attacker emit events where old_maximum equals new_maximum (no actual change), causing indexers to process unnecessary state updates and waste computational resources or create duplicate records? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Zero value bypass] Can setting both old_maximum and new_maximum to 0 bypass validation logic in downstream systems that assume maximum supply changes are always meaningful, potentially allowing unlimited token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Arithmetic logic] Does the absence of validation logic comparing old_maximum vs new_maximum allow malicious modules to emit logically inconsistent events (e.g., reducing maximum below current supply) that corrupt off-chain token tracking systems?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Address forgery] Can an attacker emit MaximumMutate events with a creator address that doesn't match the actual token creator, causing indexers to misattribute token mutations and corrupt ownership tracking?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/maximum_mutate.rs] [Struct: MaximumMutate] [Address collision] If two different accounts somehow generate the same AccountAddress (through hash collision or implementation bug), can this cause events from different creators to be confused, corrupting token ownership records?
