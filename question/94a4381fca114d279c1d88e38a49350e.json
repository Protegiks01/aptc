  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Function: build_checkers()] [Iterator panic] If the map() operation panics during checker construction, does the iterator properly handle unwinding or could partially-constructed checkers be leaked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Send + Sync safety] The Checker trait requires Send + Sync - but are all implementations verified to be truly thread-safe, or could unsafe code in checkers violate these guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Debug trait abuse] The Checker trait requires Debug - could malicious Debug implementations leak sensitive information or cause side effects when checkers are printed for logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Clone trait abuse] CheckerConfig derives Clone - could cloning certain checker configs with large embedded data structures cause performance issues or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: ProviderCollection] [Provider dependency] All checkers depend on ProviderCollection - if a provider is malicious or compromised, can it return fake data that causes all checkers to incorrectly report nodes as healthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: CheckerError] [Error classification] CheckerError distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors - can an attacker manipulate error types to force infinite retries causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait: Checker async fn check()] [Async safety] The check() method is async - are there any .await points where checkers could be cancelled or timed out, leaving resources in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Trait: Checker async fn check()] [Concurrent execution] If multiple check() calls execute concurrently on different checkers, can they interfere through shared state in the ProviderCollection or target node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Default trait] CommonCheckerConfig derives Default with required=false - can an attacker rely on default construction to bypass all required checker enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Struct: CommonCheckerConfig] [Serde default] The #[serde(default)] on required field means omitted values default to false - is this secure, or should required checks default to true for security-critical validators? (Medium)"
