(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Test Scope] [Incomplete Coverage] Does this example only test G1 scalar multiplication but miss other timing-sensitive operations (G2 operations, pairing computations, signature aggregation) that could leak cryptographic secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Line: 7] [Cache Timing] Even if scalar multiplication is data-independent in CPU cycles, can cache access patterns during BLS operations leak information about scalar values through cache-timing side-channels not detected by this test? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Line: 7] [Sample Size] Does the dudect benchmark run sufficient iterations to detect timing differences smaller than 1 CPU cycle, or could subtle side-channels exist below the test's detection threshold? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Line: 7] [Branch Prediction] Can branch prediction artifacts in modern CPUs create timing variations that appear constant-time in this test environment but leak information in production validator nodes with different CPU microarchitectures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_zkcrypto_constant_time.rs] [Example Nature] [Production Gap] Since this is an example file and not part of the production test suite, is there a risk that constant-time properties are verified manually but not continuously tested in CI/CD, allowing regressions?
