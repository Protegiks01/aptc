  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker craft a malicious OnDiskStorageConfig with a relative path containing '../' sequences to escape the data_dir boundary and read/write validator keys to arbitrary filesystem locations, potentially exposing private keys or overwriting system files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Symlink Attack] Does the path() method follow symbolic links when combining data_dir with relative paths, allowing an attacker to create symlinks that redirect secure storage to attacker-controlled locations and exfiltrate validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Path Traversal] Can the read_file() function be exploited with path traversal sequences (e.g., '../../etc/passwd') to read arbitrary files on the validator node's filesystem when loading tokens or CA certificates, exposing sensitive system credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Path Injection] When Token::FromDisk reads a token file, can an attacker manipulate the PathBuf to include null bytes, Unicode normalization tricks, or TOCTOU races to read unintended files or cause security bypasses? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::FromConfig] [Secret Exposure] Does storing Vault tokens directly in configuration files (Token::FromConfig) expose these secrets in log files, environment variables, process dumps, or configuration backups, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized Vault access and steal all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Memory Leak] When reading tokens from disk or config, are the String contents properly zeroed after use, or can sensitive tokens remain in memory where they could be extracted via memory dumps, core dumps, or swap files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Information Disclosure] Does read_file() properly handle error messages to avoid leaking file contents or partial data in error paths, or can an attacker trigger specific I/O errors that expose token data in error strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [Token Exposure] At line 178, when calling config.token.read_token().expect(), is the token properly protected in memory, or can panic messages expose the token value in stack traces, logs, or crash reports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Struct: VaultConfig] [Credential Logging] Are VaultConfig instances with embedded tokens (Token::FromConfig) ever serialized to logs or debug output via the Debug trait, potentially exposing Vault credentials in plaintext? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [TOCTOU] Between the File::open() call and read_to_string(), can an attacker replace the file with a symlink or different file content, leading to unauthorized access to validator keys or injection of malicious configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads concurrently access path() while another thread calls set_data_dir(), can race conditions lead to inconsistent path resolution, causing validators to read keys from wrong storage locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [TOCTOU] Can an attacker exploit the time gap between checking token file existence and reading its contents to replace the token file, potentially injecting malicious Vault credentials that grant attacker access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::set_data_dir()] [Concurrent Modification] When set_data_dir() is called, is there synchronization to prevent concurrent reads via path() from seeing partially updated state, potentially causing validators to use incorrect storage paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: read_file()] [Permission Bypass] Does read_file() verify that files have secure permissions (e.g., 0600) before reading sensitive tokens and certificates, or can world-readable files be used, exposing validator secrets to unprivileged users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: OnDiskStorageConfig::path()] [Directory Traversal] Does the code verify that the resulting path points to a directory owned by the validator process, or can attackers create malicious directory structures to hijack secure storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: Token::read_token()] [Access Control] When reading token files, does the code verify file ownership and ensure no other users can read the token, or can local privilege escalation allow token theft? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: From<&SecureBackend> for Storage] [File Creation] When OnDiskStorage is created with a new path, are files created with secure permissions (0600), or could newly created key files be world-readable, exposing validator private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::namespace()] [Namespace Injection] Can an attacker inject path traversal sequences or special characters into the namespace string to escape namespace isolation in Vault or OnDisk storage, accessing keys from other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/secure_backend_config.rs] [Function: SecureBackend::clear_namespace()] [Authorization Bypass] When clear_namespace() sets namespace to None, does this bypass access controls in the underlying storage, potentially allowing one validator to access another validator's keys?
