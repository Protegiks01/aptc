  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Tracker state corruption] The PartitionState contains ConflictingTxnTracker instances that expect transactions to be properly partitioned - if UniformPartitioner creates invalid partitions, can this corrupt tracker state and cause incorrect dependency tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: process()] [Gas accounting distribution] If gas accounting assumes balanced shard loads but UniformPartitioner creates imbalanced partitions, can some shards timeout while others finish quickly, causing consensus delays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [State key distribution] Does UniformPartitioner's naive splitting mean transactions writing to the same state key could be in different shards, requiring cross-shard synchronization that defeats the purpose of partitioning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: process()] [Abort cascade] If one shard's transactions abort due to conflicts and need to be re-executed, and UniformPartitioner placed many dependent transactions in other shards, can this cause a cascade of aborts across all shards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Pre-partitioned index semantics] The PrePartitionedTxnIdx values returned in line 55 - do they represent the transaction's position in the flattened pre-partitioned space, and if so, does UniformPartitioner maintain continuity (no gaps)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [PrePartitioner trait violation] According to the trait documentation in pre_partition/mod.rs, does UniformPartitioner correctly implement all required state items (ori_idxs_by_pre_partitioned, start_txn_idxs_by_shard, pre_partitioned), or are there semantic mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [PartitionState contract] Does pre_partition() in lines 38-56 correctly consume the PartitionState's available resources (state.txns, state.sender_idxs, etc.) as documented, or does it leave state in an inconsistent condition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Read set/write set ignorance] The comment in pre_partition/mod.rs mentions state.read_sets and state.write_sets are available for use, but UniformPartitioner ignores them - can this cause it to violate dependency assumptions that other partitioners respect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Sender index ignorance] UniformPartitioner doesn't use state.sender_idxs to keep transactions from the same sender together - can this cause sequence number violations when parallel executors process transactions out of sender order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Return tuple contract] The trait expects a specific tuple format (Vec<OriginalTxnIdx>, Vec<PrePartitionedTxnIdx>, Vec<Vec<PrePartitionedTxnIdx>>) - if any component is malformed, can this cause downstream PartitionerV2 to crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Struct: UniformPartitioner] [Stateless design] Since UniformPartitioner is an empty struct (line 18), does it maintain any state between calls, and can concurrent calls from different threads cause race conditions despite the apparent statelessness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Thread safety guarantee] The trait requires PrePartitioner to be Send, but does UniformPartitioner's implementation truly have no thread-safety issues when called concurrently from multiple validator threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [State modification assumption] Does pre_partition() assume PartitionState is immutable during the call, and if state.num_executor_shards or state.txns are modified by another thread, can this cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Error handling absence] The function signature in lines 39-46 has no Result<> return type - does UniformPartitioner handle all possible error conditions internally (like num_shards=0), or can it panic and crash the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: pre_partition()] [Resource cleanup] If pre_partition() allocates temporary vectors and fails partway through, are all resources properly cleaned up, or can this cause memory leaks in long-running validator processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: test_uniform_partitioner()] [Test coverage] The test in lines 60-78 only checks two cases (18 txns with 5/3 shards) - are there tests for edge cases like zero txns, one txn, more shards than txns, or usize::MAX values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: test_uniform_partitioner()] [Determinism verification] Does the test verify that running the partitioner multiple times produces identical results, ensuring deterministic execution required for consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/mod.rs] [Function: test_uniform_partitioner()] [Chunk correctness assertion] The test in line 70 checks actual.concat() equals (0..18), but does it verify that each chunk contains contiguous, non-overlapping ranges?
