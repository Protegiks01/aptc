  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [read_public_identity_file] [Large file attack] Can attackers provide gigabyte-sized YAML files that cause memory exhaustion when read_from_file loads the entire file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [read_public_identity_file] [Malicious YAML] Can YAML bombs (exponential expansion via anchors/aliases) in the identity file cause CPU/memory DoS during parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateLayoutTemplate] [Root owned layout] If the user runs GenerateLayoutTemplate as root, can layout files be created with restrictive permissions that prevent normal users from reading them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateLayoutTemplate] [Layout tampering] After layout file creation, can it be modified by unauthorized users due to weak file permissions, changing genesis parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateAdminWriteSet] [Script complexity] Can overly complex Move scripts that pass compilation consume excessive gas or execution time when applied at genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateAdminWriteSet] [Write-set size] Is there a limit on the size of the generated writeset, or can massive writesets cause memory issues when loaded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [GenerateAdminWriteSet] [Multiple writesets] Can multiple admin writesets be generated and potentially conflict when applied to the same genesis state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [All functions] [Async safety] Are all async operations properly canceled or awaited, or can premature termination leave files or git repositories in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [All functions] [Logging sensitivity] Do error messages or debug logs accidentally include private key material, addresses, or other sensitive genesis information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [All functions] [Platform differences] Do file operations behave consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows, or can platform-specific behaviors break genesis setup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [All functions] [Unicode handling] Can Unicode characters in filenames, usernames, or paths cause issues with file system operations or YAML serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [All functions] [Command injection] If any user-provided strings are passed to shell commands (unlikely but check), can command injection occur? (Critical if found)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Struct: GenerateKeys] [Field validation] Are all fields in GenerateKeys struct properly validated before use, or can malformed OptionalPoolAddressArgs or RngArgs cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Struct: SetValidatorConfiguration] [Field sanitization] Are username, validator_host, and full_node_host sanitized to remove control characters or null bytes before being used in file paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Constants] [File extension missing] Do PRIVATE_KEYS_FILE, PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE, etc. have proper .yaml extensions that help prevent users from accidentally executing them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Import security] [Dependency vulnerabilities] Do imported crates (async_trait, clap, aptos_genesis, aptos_types) have known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through this interface? (High if found)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Type safety] [AccountAddress conversion] Do .into() conversions for AccountAddress properly handle all edge cases including special addresses like 0x0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Memory safety] [Resource cleanup] Are all file handles, git connections, and memory allocations properly cleaned up even when errors occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Concurrency] [Thread safety] If multiple threads call these functions simultaneously, can data races occur in shared state like git repositories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Validation] [Optional field handling] Do all functions properly handle cases where Optional fields are None, or can None values cause panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Cryptography] [Key entropy] Does generate_key_objects() ensure sufficient entropy for all key types, or can low-entropy sources create weak keys? (Critical)",
