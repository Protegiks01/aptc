  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: Script::new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker create a Script with an arbitrarily large code vector (Vec<u8>) that exceeds memory limits, causing validator nodes to crash or exhaust resources during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: Script::new()] [Malicious bytecode] Does Script::new() perform any validation on the bytecode in the code parameter, or can an attacker submit malformed/malicious Move bytecode that crashes the VM or causes undefined behavior during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: Script::new()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker craft a Script where the combined size of code, ty_args, and args vectors causes integer overflow in size calculations, leading to memory corruption or buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Type argument manipulation] Can an attacker supply malicious TypeTag values in ty_args that exploit type system vulnerabilities in the Move VM, potentially bypassing type safety guarantees or causing type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Argument injection] Can an attacker craft TransactionArgument values in the args field that exploit deserialization bugs or bypass validation checks in the VM's argument processing logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: Script::code()] [Bytecode leak] Does the code() method leak sensitive bytecode information that could be used to reverse-engineer private contract logic or identify vulnerabilities before public disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: Script::into_inner()] [Ownership bypass] Can the into_inner() method be used to extract and manipulate Script components in ways that bypass validation or safety checks that would normally apply to intact Script objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Serialization bomb] Can an attacker create a Script with carefully crafted nested data structures in ty_args or args that explode in size during serialization/deserialization, causing denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Clone attack] Since Script implements Clone, can an attacker exploit cloning behavior to duplicate expensive resources or bypass reference counting protections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Hash collision] Does the Hash implementation for Script properly handle collisions, or can an attacker craft different Scripts that produce the same hash, potentially bypassing deduplication or caching mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::new()] [Unauthorized module access] Can an attacker craft a malicious ModuleId in the module field to target system modules (like 0x1::account or 0x1::coin) that should only be callable through specific entry points, potentially bypassing access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::new()] [Function name injection] Can an attacker supply an invalid or malicious Identifier in the function field that exploits parsing vulnerabilities or references non-existent functions to cause VM crashes? (High)",

(High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::module()] [Module pointer manipulation] Since module() returns a reference to ModuleId, can concurrent modifications or race conditions during transaction processing lead to use-after-free or dangling pointer issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::function()] [Identifier bypass] Can an attacker exploit the function() method to access internal function names that should not be exposed as entry points, bypassing visibility controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::args()] [BCS deserialization attack] Since args() returns raw Vec<Vec<u8>> without validation, can an attacker inject malformed BCS-encoded data that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities in the VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::into_inner()] [Component extraction] Can the into_inner() method be used to extract EntryFunction components and reconstruct them in invalid combinations that bypass validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryFunction::as_entry_function_payload()] [Address manipulation] Does the conversion to EntryFunctionPayload properly validate that module.address is a legitimate account, or can attackers target arbitrary addresses including system or non-existent accounts?
