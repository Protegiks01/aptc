  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [Type: Listener] [Type confusion] Can a malicious actor exploit the Listener type alias being a pinned boxed stream to inject crafted stream items that bypass peer verification, potentially allowing unauthorized validators to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/boxed.rs] [Type: Inbound] [Memory safety] Does the Inbound pinned future properly handle panics during connection establishment, or could a panic in the boxed future lead to memory corruption affecting validator state and causing consensus failure?
