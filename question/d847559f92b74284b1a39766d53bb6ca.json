  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/config_sanitizer.rs] [Error handling] [Panic safety] Are there any code paths that could panic (unwrap(), expect(), index out of bounds) instead of returning proper errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/config_sanitizer.rs] [Edge cases] [Empty string handling] If network IDs, sanitizer names, or error messages contain empty strings, does this cause validation bypasses? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/config_sanitizer.rs] [Attack scenario] [Malicious validator onboarding] Can a new validator join with skip_config_sanitizer=true, bypassing all security checks, then participate in consensus with an unsafe configuration causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/config_sanitizer.rs] [Attack scenario] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker modify a validator's configuration file mid-flight (before sanitization) to inject malicious network configs that allow eavesdropping on consensus messages? (High)",
