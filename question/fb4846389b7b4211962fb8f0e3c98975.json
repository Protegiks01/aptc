  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Integration] [Error handling gas charges] When native functions return errors (e.g., BCS_TO_BYTES_FAILURE), is the error handling itself metered? Can attackers trigger expensive error paths without paying gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Determinism] [Gas calculation determinism] Are all gas calculations (multiplication of per-unit costs by quantities) guaranteed to produce identical results across all validators regardless of CPU architecture, compiler optimizations, or Rust version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Determinism] [Floating point elimination] Do any gas calculations involve floating point arithmetic (even indirectly through libraries), which could cause non-deterministic rounding and consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Determinism] [NumBytes measurement consistency] When measuring byte lengths for per-byte gas charging, are measurements taken on raw bytes vs serialized representations consistent across all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [DoS] [Transaction bloating] Can attackers create transactions that maximize gas expenditure on underpriced operations to effectively DoS the network by filling blocks with low-value but high-resource transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [DoS] [Memory exhaustion via serialization] Can attackers craft inputs that cause native functions to allocate excessive memory (e.g., BCS serialization of large structures) where memory allocation costs aren't captured by gas parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [DoS] [CPU-bound operation chains] Can attackers chain multiple CPU-intensive operations (hash + BCS + string operations) in ways that compound underpricing issues to achieve effective validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [DoS] [Cache thrashing attacks] Can attackers exploit gas parameters that don't account for CPU cache behavior by submitting operations with access patterns designed to maximize cache misses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Implementation] [String unsafe blocks] String native functions use unsafe { std::str::from_utf8_unchecked } - if the UTF8 validation in check_utf8 is bypassed or has bugs, can attackers exploit UB in subsequent string operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Implementation] [BCS layout construction] The BCS native comments mention layout construction can fail - does the failure gas path (3676) cover the worst-case cost of attempting to construct layouts for pathologically complex types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Implementation] [Vector reference handling] Vector move_range operates on references - does the gas model account for reference validity checking, borrow checking, and potential defensive copies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Governance] [Gas parameter update attacks] Can malicious governance proposals set gas parameters to extreme values (0 or MAX) to either enable free DoS attacks or price out legitimate users? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Governance] [Parameter ratio manipulation] Can governance proposals manipulate relative costs between operations (e.g., make SHA3 much cheaper than SHA2) to create economic incentives for suboptimal behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Governance] [Upgrade atomicity] When gas parameters are updated, is the update atomic across all parameters, or can partial updates create inconsistent gas schedules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Edge case] [Zero-cost operations] If any per-unit cost is set to 0 (either intentionally or through parameter updates), can attackers perform unlimited operations of that type? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum gas values] What happens when gas calculations approach or exceed u64::MAX? Are there overflow protections, or can attackers trigger wrapping behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Edge case] [Empty input handling] For all operations with per-unit costs, are empty inputs (0 bytes, 0 elements) handled correctly where only base costs apply? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/move_stdlib.rs] [Edge case] [Unicode boundary cases] For string operations, are Unicode edge cases (surrogate pairs, zero-width characters, combining characters) correctly accounted for in gas calculations? (Medium)",
