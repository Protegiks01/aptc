  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [CI/CD Pipeline Exploitation] Can attackers who compromise build systems inject failpoint configurations that enable failpoints in production releases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Debug Build Detection] Can attackers fingerprint debug vs release builds by probing for failpoint functionality, then target debug builds with specific exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Smoke Test Artifacts] Do smoke tests leave failpoint configurations active after completion, potentially affecting production validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Mempool Integration] Can failpoints in transaction submission APIs corrupt mempool state or cause transaction censorship by preventing certain transactions from entering mempool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Storage Layer Impact] If API failpoints trigger errors during storage operations, can this corrupt AptosDB indices or cause state merkle tree inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Consensus Communication] Can failpoints in API handlers that communicate with consensus (via mempool) disrupt validator participation or block proposal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Network Protocol] Do failpoints affect network protocol handlers, potentially causing peers to mark the node as misbehaving or blacklist it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [State Sync] Can failpoints interrupt state synchronization processes, preventing new nodes from joining the network or causing sync failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Signature Verification] If failpoints interrupt signature verification in transaction submission, can unsigned transactions be accepted into mempool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Gas Calculation] Can failpoints trigger after gas calculation but before gas enforcement, allowing free transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Sequence Number Validation] If failpoints activate after sequence number checks pass, can they enable transaction replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Authentication Token] Can failpoints be used to bypass API authentication by crashing handlers before auth checks complete? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Memory Leaks] When failpoints trigger errors, are all allocated resources (HTTP connections, database handles, locks) properly cleaned up via RAII, or can repeated activations leak memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Thread Pool Exhaustion] Can failpoints cause API handler threads to hang or fail to return to the thread pool, eventually exhausting available threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [File Descriptor Leaks] If failpoints interrupt file I/O operations, can this leak file descriptors for database files or network sockets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Tokio Runtime Impact] Since the API uses async/await and tokio, can failpoint errors cause tasks to be dropped without proper cleanup, corrupting the async runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Allow Directives] The file has #![allow(unused_imports)] and #[allow(unused_variables)] - do these disable important compiler warnings that could detect security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Inline Optimization] Does the #[inline] attribute cause failpoint checks to be optimized out in release builds when they should be conditionally compiled, potentially including failpoint code in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Dead Code Elimination] Is the fail::fail_point! macro properly eliminated by the compiler in non-failpoint builds, or can dead code analysis failures leave failpoint infrastructure in production binaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Generic Constraints] The generic E: InternalError bound - can callers pass unexpected error types that violate API error handling contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Lifetime Issues] Although not apparent in this function, can the failpoint name string's lifetime cause use-after-free if the fail crate stores references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Unsafe Code] Does the fail crate use unsafe code internally that could be exploited through malformed failpoint names or actions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Imports] The file imports poem_openapi::payload::Json but doesn't use it - can this unused import indicate missing JSON response handling that could leak information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Poem Error Conversion] How does the InternalError type integrate with Poem's error handling, and can error conversion expose internal details? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Middleware Bypass] Can failpoint errors bypass Poem middleware (logging, compression, CORS) that should process all responses? (Medium)"
