  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryABI::is_transaction_script_abi()] [ABI spoofing] Can is_transaction_script_abi() be fooled by crafted EntryABI values to incorrectly identify transaction types and route them to wrong execution paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Function: EntryABI::name()] [String injection] Does the name() method properly sanitize or validate the returned string, or can malicious ABI names contain control characters or escape sequences that exploit downstream processing? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/script.rs] [Struct: Script] [Bytecode verification gap] Does Script lack built-in bytecode verification, allowing invalid or malicious bytecode to pass through until VM execution, potentially crashing validators mid-consensus? (Critical)",
