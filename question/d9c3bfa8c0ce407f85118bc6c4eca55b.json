  "[File: third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/deserializer.rs] [Function: deserialize_compiled_module()] [Panic Recovery] The catch_unwind at line 57 catches panics during deserialization - can an attacker craft bytecode that panics in a way that leaves global state corrupted but returns VERIFIER_INVARIANT_VIOLATION without cleanup? (Critical)",
