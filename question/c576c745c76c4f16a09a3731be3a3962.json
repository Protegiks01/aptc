  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: eval()] [Test-production inconsistency] Since eval() is marked for testing only, can implementations diverge between eval() and the production path (create_share + aggregate_shares + derive_eval), causing test coverage gaps?
