  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Unauthorized Execution] When self.execute is true at line 66, does execute_past_transactions at line 74 properly validate that the user has authorization to re-execute historical transactions, or can any user replay sensitive transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [State Corruption] Can re-executing transactions via execute_past_transactions at line 74 with modified concurrency_level values cause state inconsistencies or expose non-deterministic execution bugs that could affect production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker set concurrency_level to u64::MAX at line 19 and pass it to execute_past_transactions at line 74, causing the debugger to spawn millions of threads and crash the system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy Attack] If execute_past_transactions at line 74 is called with a transaction that itself spawns additional transactions, can this create unbounded recursion or reentrancy that exhausts stack space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Gas Bypass] Does transaction re-execution at line 74 enforce gas limits, or can an attacker replay expensive transactions without paying gas, effectively getting free computation on debugger infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Async Race Condition] Are there race conditions between the await calls at lines 54 and 75 where the blockchain state could change between version lookup and execution, causing inconsistent results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Concurrent Instance Attack] Can multiple instances of this Command be run simultaneously against the same transaction, and if so, do they interfere with each other's REST API calls or shared debugger state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Thread Safety] Is the AptosDebugger instance at line 51 thread-safe, or can concurrent calls to get_version_by_account_sequence and execute_past_transactions cause data races in shared state? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Struct: Command] [Default Value Attack] Can the default concurrency_level of 1 at line 18 be exploited to cause slow execution that ties up debugger resources, or should there be upper bounds on this value? (Low)",
