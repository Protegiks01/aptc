  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [VM Integration: Generic Constraints] [Generic Bound Bypass] Can MoveResource implementations violate generic constraints that would be enforced in Move code (e.g., store constraint on type parameters), causing type system violations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Framework: System Resources] [System Resource Spoofing] Can an attacker implement MoveResource for types matching framework system resource signatures (Account, Coin, StakePool), allowing them to inject malicious resources that are treated as legitimate by framework code? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Framework: Resource Groups] [Resource Group Confusion] If resources are part of resource groups, does resource_path() correctly differentiate group members, or can path collisions allow access to wrong resources within a group? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Framework: Access Control] [Access Control Bypass] Does the trait provide any mechanism to enforce that only authorized code can implement MoveResource for system-critical types, or can any external crate create resources claiming to be from the framework? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Crypto: Hash Collisions] [SHA3 Collision] If struct_tag().access_vector() produces hash collisions in the underlying storage system's key hashing, can two different resources map to the same storage location, causing data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Crypto: Preimage Attack] [Path Preimage] Can an attacker compute a MoveResource implementation whose resource_path() matches a target existing resource, allowing them to overwrite or manipulate that resource? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Crypto: Length Extension] [BCS Length Extension] Does the BCS serialization in struct_tag().access_vector() have length extension vulnerabilities where attackers can append data to resource paths without invalidating them? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Gas: Path Generation Cost] [Gas Metering Bypass] Is resource_path() computation properly gas metered, or can attackers create resources with extremely long paths (long module/struct names, many type args) that consume excessive gas but aren't charged? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Gas: Allocation Cost] [Allocation Attack] Can repeated calls to module_identifier() and struct_identifier() (which allocate owned Identifiers) be used for allocation-based DoS attacks without proper gas accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Resource: Memory Consumption] [Memory Exhaustion] Can type_args() return an extremely large Vec<TypeTag> that causes memory exhaustion when struct_tag() constructs StructTag and resource_path() serializes it? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [API: Public Interface] [Interface Stability] Are MoveStructType and MoveResource traits considered stable public API, and can breaking changes to their interface cause resource inaccessibility across protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [API: Foreign Function Interface] [FFI Safety] If these traits are exposed across FFI boundaries (e.g., to Move VM), are there proper safety checks to prevent foreign code from creating invalid trait implementations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [API: Reflection] [Reflection Attacks] Can Rust reflection APIs be used to dynamically construct MoveResource implementations at runtime that bypass compile-time validation and type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [DoS: Computational Complexity] [Quadratic Complexity] Does resource_path() have quadratic or exponential complexity for resources with many type arguments, allowing DoS through crafted resource type signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [DoS: Stack Overflow] [Deep Recursion] Can deeply nested type_args() (e.g., Vector<Vector<Vector<...>>>) cause stack overflow during struct_tag() construction or BCS serialization in access_vector()? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [DoS: Infinite Loop] [Circular Type References] Can circular type references in type_args() cause infinite loops when struct_tag() attempts to resolve all type parameters? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Move: Resource Semantics] [Resource Linearity Violation] Does the Rust implementation of MoveResource enforce Move's linear type semantics (no copy/drop), or can resources be accidentally cloned or dropped violating resource safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Move: Global Storage Model] [Global Storage Bypass] Can MoveResource be used to access global storage without going through Move's borrow_global/move_to primitives, bypassing access control and ownership checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-core/types/src/move_resource.rs] [Move: Module System] [Module Boundary Violation] Can cross-module MoveResource implementations violate Move's module boundary restrictions, accessing private resources or calling private functions? (High)"
