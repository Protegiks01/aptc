  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header encoding] Does to_str().ok() properly handle non-UTF8 header values, or could attackers inject binary data that fails to_str() but bypasses validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Header size] Are there limits on Authorization header size to prevent attackers from sending extremely long headers that cause excessive memory allocation during parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Error leak] Do the detailed error messages on lines 50 and 58-61 provide too much information to attackers about the authentication system's internals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty return] When X_IS_JWT_HEADER is present, the function returns Ok(vec![]) - is this the correct signal that validation passed, or could other code misinterpret an empty rejection list? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Exception handling] If ListManager.contains() panics or returns an error, is there proper error handling to prevent the entire faucet service from crashing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Concurrent access] The check() method is async but accesses self.manager without any locking - can concurrent requests cause data races when checking token membership? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Async execution] Since check() is async but doesn't await anything, is there unnecessary async overhead, and could improper await usage in callers cause timing-based race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Thread safety] The AuthTokenChecker is used by multiple async tasks - is the ListManager thread-safe for concurrent reads, or could this cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Complete method] This checker doesn't implement complete() beyond the default - should it track completed requests with auth tokens to detect replay attacks or rate limiting bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Spawn tasks] This checker doesn't implement spawn_periodic_tasks() - should it periodically reload tokens or validate token list integrity to prevent stale validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token encoding] Are tokens compared as raw bytes or strings, and could URL encoding (%20), base64 variations, or other encodings bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token padding] If tokens have leading/trailing whitespace from split_whitespace(), is this trimmed before comparison, or could ' token ' differ from 'token' in the HashSet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Special characters] Can tokens contain special characters like quotes, semicolons, or newlines that might be interpreted differently during parsing vs storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Token length] Are there minimum or maximum token length validations, or can attackers use empty strings or extremely long strings to cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Data fields] The checker only uses data.headers but ignores receiver, source_ip, and time_request_received_secs - should these be considered for enhanced security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [IP binding] Should tokens be bound to specific source IPs to prevent token theft, or is the current token-only validation sufficient? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Time validation] Should tokens have expiration times checked using time_request_received_secs to prevent indefinite token validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenChecker] [Visibility] The manager field is public - could external code directly modify the token list bypassing validation and logging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Struct: AuthTokenChecker] [Immutability] Should the manager be wrapped in Arc<RwLock<>> to enable safe runtime updates while maintaining thread safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Config validation] Does new() validate that the config points to a readable file before attempting to load, or could it fail silently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Logging security] The info! log on lines 22-25 reveals the number of tokens loaded - could this leak security-relevant information to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: new()] [Error propagation] If ListManager::new() returns an error, does the entire faucet fail to start, or does it start without auth token checking creating a security hole? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [JWT integration] When X_IS_JWT_HEADER is set, does this checker verify that FirebaseJwtVerifier was actually enabled and will validate the JWT, or could JWT validation be disabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Checker bypass] If other checkers like MagicHeaderChecker are configured, can attackers bypass token validation by exploiting checker ordering or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/auth_token.rs] [Function: check()] [Multiple auth methods] If both auth token and JWT validation are enabled, can attackers exploit inconsistencies between the two authentication methods? (High)"
