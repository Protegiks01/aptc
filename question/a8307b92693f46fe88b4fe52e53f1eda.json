  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [Augmentation string] The augmentation parameter is hardcoded to b'G1' - is this sufficient for domain separation, or should it include additional context (validator ID, epoch) to prevent replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [Seed size security] Is 2 * G1_PROJ_NUM_BYTES (192 bytes) sufficient entropy for hash-to-curve, and has this been validated against the security proofs requiring minimum input entropy? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [Performance DoS] The comment states this takes 50 microseconds - can an attacker trigger excessive calls to random_g1_point() during DKG to cause validator slowdowns and timeout attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [RNG seed reuse] If the same rand_seed is generated by a compromised RNG across multiple validators, will they generate identical G1 points compromising DKG uniqueness requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [Identity point] Can hash_to_curve() ever return the identity point (point at infinity), and would this cause DKG verification failures or discrete log problems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_point()] [Subgroup check] Does the generated G1 point automatically lie in the prime-order subgroup, or could points in small-order subgroups compromise DKG security through small subgroup attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_point()] [Performance timing attack] Taking 150 microseconds per call, can attackers measure timing variations in G2 point generation to infer information about the random seed or RNG state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_point()] [G2 vs G1 security parity] Since G2 uses different curve parameters, has it been verified that G2 hash-to-curve provides equivalent security guarantees to G1, preventing G2-specific cryptographic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_point()] [Seed entropy] With 2 * G2_PROJ_NUM_BYTES (~384 bytes), is this excessive entropy actually used by hash-to-curve, or could reduced entropy be sufficient opening optimization vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_point()] [Domain separator collision] Using the same DST_RAND_CORE_HELL but different augmentation b'G2', could crafted inputs cause G1/G2 point collisions in different contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_point()] [Validator DoS] Given the 3x slower performance vs G1 (150μs vs 50μs), can malicious validators force disproportionate G2 generation to degrade honest validator performance during DKG? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Discrete log exposure] The comment warns this is 'insecure' because the discrete log is known - can an attacker abuse this in production DKG code to extract the scalar 's' and reconstruct secret keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Misuse in production] Are there any code paths in aptos-dkg that incorrectly use insecure_random_gt_point() for security-critical operations instead of just testing/benchmarking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Scalar reuse] If the random scalar 's' from random_scalar() is reused elsewhere or leaked through side-channels, does this enable attackers to solve discrete log problems for GT elements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Generator security] Is Gt::generator() always the canonical GT generator, and could using non-standard generators enable pairing-based attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Performance 507μs] The 507 microsecond execution time suggests expensive pairing operations - can this be exploited for timing side-channel attacks revealing the scalar 's'? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/utils/random.rs] [Function: insecure_random_gt_point()] [Comment validation] The TODO comment mentions Fp12 not being exposed - does this limitation force using the insecure method, and should proper secure GT randomness be implemented? (High)",
