  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Zero-length range] If current_progress == target_version, creating an empty range [version..version), does the batch.put() still update progress metadata, and could this cause spurious progress updates without actual pruning work? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Single version] When pruning exactly one version (range [n..n+1)), are all edge cases handled correctly, or could off-by-one errors cause adjacent versions to be included or excluded from deletion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero progress] If both progress and metadata_progress are 0 during initialization, does the catch-up prune(0, 0) cause any issues, or is it correctly handled as a no-op? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Maximum version] Can the pruner handle target_version == u64::MAX - 1 without overflow when the range is used in TransactionAuxiliaryDataDb::prune(), or could this cause edge case failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Progress regression] If stored progress is greater than metadata_progress (shouldn't happen normally), does the code detect this anomaly or could it cause prune() to be called with a backwards range? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Information leak] Does the info! log in new() that prints progress and metadata_progress expose sensitive information about database state that could be exploited by attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Silent errors] If prune() encounters non-critical errors during deletion but continues anyway, are these errors logged, or could data corruption accumulate silently without operator awareness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: name()] [Monitoring confusion] If the pruner name 'TransactionAuxiliaryDataPruner' conflicts with metric labels used elsewhere, could this cause monitoring dashboards to display incorrect pruning statistics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Startup visibility] Is there sufficient logging to debug cases where initialization fails or takes excessive time, or could operators be unable to diagnose pruner startup issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Progress tracking] Without progress metrics emitted during prune() execution, can operators monitor whether the pruner is making forward progress or is stuck in an infinite loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [RocksDB compaction] After deleting large ranges of auxiliary data, does the underlying RocksDB perform compaction efficiently, or could deleted tombstones accumulate causing database bloat and performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Write amplification] Does SchemaBatch optimize bulk deletions, or could deleting millions of versions cause excessive write amplification in RocksDB, multiplying disk I/O by 10-100x? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Column family isolation] Is transaction_auxiliary_data_db stored in a separate RocksDB column family? If not, could pruning operations affect unrelated data in the same column family? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [WAL replay] If write_schemas() succeeds but the node crashes before RocksDB flushes memtables to disk, could WAL replay on restart cause the deletions to be reapplied, or worse, not applied at all? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Snapshot isolation] Can database snapshots created for state sync include transaction auxiliary data that is simultaneously being deleted by prune(), leading to inconsistent snapshot contents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Consensus slowdown] If prune() execution blocks the database for extended periods, could this prevent the validator from committing new transactions in time, causing it to miss proposal deadlines and lose rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [State sync divergence] If different validators prune auxiliary data at different rates due to varying hardware, could this cause state sync issues where nodes request data that other nodes have already pruned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Network partition] In the event of a network partition, if some validators prune more aggressively than others, could this create permanent data availability divergence requiring manual intervention? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Byzantine behavior detection] If transaction auxiliary data contains evidence of Byzantine behavior (e.g., invalid transaction attempts), can pruning this data prematurely prevent detection and slashing of malicious validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch transition] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, can inconsistent pruning states between old and new validators cause consensus issues or prevent successful epoch finalization?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Mock testing] Can the pruner be safely mocked or stubbed in tests, or do integration tests require a real RocksDB instance, making it harder to test edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_auxiliary_data_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Fuzz testing] Has the prune() function been fuzz tested with randomized version ranges including edge cases like overflow, underflow, and invalid ranges to ensure robustness?
