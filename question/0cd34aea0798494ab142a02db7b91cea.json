  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Struct: SecretSharingConfig] [Threshold configuration] If threshold is set too low (e.g., < n/3), can Byzantine validators collude to compromise randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/secret_share_manager.rs] [Function: SecretShareManager::process_incoming_block()] [Share derivation] The secret_sharing_derive_self_fut - can Byzantine blocks with malicious randomness seeds cause honest validators to derive predictable shares? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Field: digest_key] [Commitment scheme] Does the digest_key properly commit to randomness, or can malleability allow manipulation? (High)",
