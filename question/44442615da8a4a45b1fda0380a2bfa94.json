  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Function: add_key()] [Memory ordering] Does Ordering::SeqCst at line 186 provide necessary synchronization, or can weaker ordering cause race conditions in multi-threaded key addition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Function: add_sender()] [Memory ordering] Can the Ordering::SeqCst at line 207 be relaxed to improve performance, or is the strong ordering necessary to prevent sender index corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Function: num_keys()] [Acquire ordering] Should Ordering::SeqCst at line 175 be replaced with Ordering::Acquire for reading the counter, or does this risk stale counter values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Function: num_senders()] [Acquire ordering] Can the Ordering::SeqCst load at line 179 be safely weakened to Ordering::Acquire without introducing race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Struct field: storage_key_counter] [Counter synchronization] Can the AtomicUsize at line 76 overflow and wrap around, causing key index collisions if not properly handled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs] [Function: new()] [Incomplete initialization] Can the PartitionState be used before all fields are properly initialized, causing panics or undefined behavior when accessing uninitialized vectors? (High)",
