  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Error: from_u8() None] [Silent failures] When from_u8() returns None for invalid bytes, do all callers properly handle this case, or could None be unwrapped causing panics that halt validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Integration: Module bytecode] [Bytecode deserialization] When Move bytecode is deserialized and ability sets are extracted, if the bytecode format allows invalid ability bytes to be injected, can this bypass from_u8() validation and corrupt type metadata? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Integration: Type signatures] [Signature verification] Type signatures include ability constraints - if ability sets in signatures can be manipulated (e.g., via bytecode patching), could attackers call functions with incorrectly typed arguments that violate safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Integration: Storage layout] [Global storage schema] When types with Key ability are stored globally, if their ability sets are not re-validated on retrieval, could on-chain data corruption cause invalid types to be loaded from storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Arithmetic: Ability as u8] [Cast safety] Abilities are cast to u8 via 'as' operator throughout the code - if the enum representation changes or if unsafe code violates repr(u8), could these casts produce unexpected values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Logic: Set operations] [Algebraic properties] Do operations like union, intersect, setminus satisfy expected algebraic properties (commutativity, associativity, distributivity)? Could violations of these properties cause type checking bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Attack: Resource theft] [Copy exploitation] Can an attacker deploy a malicious module where Coin<AptosCoin> or other asset types incorrectly have Copy ability due to ability checking bugs, allowing them to duplicate tokens and steal unlimited funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Attack: Storage pollution] [Key bypass] Can an attacker bypass Key ability checks to store arbitrary data structures in global storage, causing state bloat that degrades network performance or violates storage invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Attack: Signer duplication] [Signer Copy] Can an attacker exploit ability bugs to copy or store Signer values, allowing them to impersonate other accounts and execute unauthorized transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Attack: Reference persistence] [Reference Store] Can an attacker store references in global storage by bypassing Store ability checks, causing dangling pointers or memory corruption when references outlive their referents? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Attack: Type confusion] [Generic type injection] Can an attacker instantiate Vector<T> where T has incorrect abilities (e.g., T lacks Store but Vector<T> is stored globally), causing type confusion when elements are accessed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Scenario: Nested generics] [Recursive constraints] For deeply nested generics like Vector<Vector<Vector<T>>>, does polymorphic_abilities() correctly propagate constraints through all levels, or could deep nesting cause stack overflow or incorrect ability computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Scenario: Phantom with effects] [Phantom side effects] If a phantom type parameter's abilities are used to construct the containing type's abilities incorrectly (phantom should be excluded), could this create types with overly permissive abilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Scenario: Ability inheritance] [Struct field constraints] When a struct with ability A has fields that need ability A.requires(), if field abilities are not validated, could structs be created with abilities their fields don't support? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Scenario: Module boundaries] [Cross-module types] When generic types are instantiated across module boundaries, if ability constraints are not consistently enforced, could module A pass insufficiently constrained types to module B? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Protocol: Aptos Framework] [Framework type safety] If Aptos Framework modules like coin.move or stake.move rely on ability checks for security, could bugs in ability.rs allow attackers to bypass economic security mechanisms and manipulate staking or governance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Protocol: Transaction validation] [Prologue/epilogue] If transaction validation in prologue/epilogue functions assumes certain types have specific abilities, could ability bugs allow transactions to bypass gas payment or signature checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/ability.rs] [Protocol: Account resources] [Account structure] If account-related types require specific abilities (e.g., Key for account resources), could ability bugs allow unauthorized modification of account balances or configurations? (Critical)"
