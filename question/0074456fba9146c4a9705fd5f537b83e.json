  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Array bounds violation] Can an attacker trigger a panic by providing exactly one argument (matching `args.len() < 2`), causing the condition check to pass but then accessing `args[1]` at line 19-20 which would be out of bounds, leading to process crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Logic error] Does the condition at line 12 `args.len() < 2 || args.len() > 1 && matches!(args[1].as_str(), '-h' | '--help')` have a logical flaw where `args.len() > 1` is always true when `args.len() < 2` is false, potentially allowing bypass of help message display for edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker provide arguments with special characters or extremely long strings in `args[1]` that could cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion when passed to `benchmark::benchmark(&args[1..])` or `plot::plot_svg(&args[1..])`? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode handling] Can an attacker exploit Unicode normalization issues or homoglyph attacks by providing arguments that visually appear as 'bench' or 'plot' but use different Unicode characters, bypassing the string matching at lines 19-26 and reaching the unknown tool error path? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Case sensitivity] Is the tool name comparison at lines 19-26 case-sensitive, allowing an attacker to bypass intended functionality by providing 'BENCH' or 'Plot' or other case variations that won't match the expected lowercase strings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Slice bounds] When creating the slice `&args[1..]` at line 20 and 22, can an attacker provide an empty args vector (after binary name) causing undefined behavior or panic when the benchmark/plot functions expect at least the tool name in the slice? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an extremely large number of command-line arguments causing memory exhaustion when `std::env::args().collect_vec()` at line 11 attempts to allocate memory for all arguments, leading to DoS before any validation occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Argument parsing] Does the `collect_vec()` call at line 11 properly handle malformed UTF-8 sequences in command-line arguments, or could this cause panics or undefined behavior when processing non-UTF-8 input on systems that allow such arguments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error disclosure] Does the error message at line 23 `println!('prover-lab: error: {}', x)` potentially leak sensitive information about the system's file paths, configuration, or internal state when plot::plot_svg returns an error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Exit code abuse] Can the non-standard exit codes (1, 2, 10) at lines 17, 24, 29 be exploited by shell scripts or orchestration tools that make security decisions based on exit codes, potentially bypassing security checks if they only check for 0 vs non-zero? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] Does the error handling at line 22-25 properly sanitize error messages from `plot::plot_svg()` before printing them, or could malicious input in data files cause injection of ANSI escape codes or other terminal control sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic handling] If benchmark::benchmark() panics at line 20 instead of returning normally, does this leave any resources in an inconsistent state or leak sensitive information through panic messages that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path traversal] When passing `&args[1..]` to `benchmark::benchmark()` at line 20, can an attacker inject path traversal sequences like '../../../etc/passwd' in subsequent arguments that get interpreted as file paths, allowing unauthorized file access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command injection] Can an attacker craft arguments that, when passed to benchmark::benchmark() at line 20, lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the benchmark module executes shell commands or invokes external processes with unsanitized input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the benchmark::benchmark() call at line 20 have proper resource limits, or can an attacker provide arguments that cause it to consume unlimited CPU, memory, or disk space, leading to system-wide DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File system attacks] When benchmark::benchmark() is invoked at line 20 with attacker-controlled arguments, can this lead to creation of files in arbitrary locations, filling up disk space, or overwriting critical system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Symlink attacks] If benchmark::benchmark() creates or reads files based on arguments passed at line 20, can an attacker exploit TOCTOU races using symlinks to read or write to privileged files they shouldn't have access to? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path traversal in plot] When invoking `plot::plot_svg(&args[1..])` at line 22, can an attacker provide file paths with '../' sequences that allow reading or writing files outside the intended directory, potentially accessing sensitive configuration or overwriting critical files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [SVG injection] Can an attacker manipulate arguments passed to plot::plot_svg() at line 22 to inject malicious content into generated SVG files that could lead to XSS when viewed in browsers or information disclosure when parsed by vulnerable SVG renderers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error information leak] Does the error handling at lines 22-25 validate that error messages from plot::plot_svg() don't contain sensitive information like absolute file paths, usernames, or system configuration details before displaying them to users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File overwrite] Can an attacker use the plot command at line 22 to overwrite existing critical files by specifying output paths that point to system files, potentially causing system instability or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Zip bomb equivalent] Can an attacker provide specially crafted benchmark data files to plot::plot_svg() at line 22 that expand to enormous SVG files, causing disk space exhaustion or memory exhaustion when the SVG is rendered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Time-of-check vs time-of-use] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability between checking `args[1].as_str()` at lines 19-26 and actually using the arguments in benchmark::benchmark() or plot::plot_svg(), where the args vector could be modified by another thread? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Match exhaustiveness] Does the match statement at lines 19-30 handle all possible string values correctly, or could there be edge cases with null bytes, non-ASCII characters, or extremely long strings that cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Default case abuse] Can an attacker exploit the default case at lines 27-30 to probe the system by trying various tool names and analyzing the error responses to gain information about the system's configuration or installed tools?
