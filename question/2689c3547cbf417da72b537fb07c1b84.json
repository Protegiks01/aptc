  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Non-reflexive equality] Are there edge cases where a LatencyPingRequest instance does not equal itself (violating reflexivity), potentially breaking HashMap/HashSet invariants? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Request reordering] Can an attacker deliberately send requests out of order (e.g., LatencyPing with counter 100 before counter 99) to cause state inconsistencies in client-side request tracking? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Missing authentication] Does the request structure contain any authentication tokens or signatures, or can any peer send any request type without proving identity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Missing authorization] Are there authorization checks to limit which peers can send GetNetworkInformation vs GetNodeInformation, or can untrusted peers query sensitive data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNetworkInformation] [Privilege escalation] Can a non-validator peer send GetNetworkInformation to discover validator-only network topology, enabling targeted attacks on consensus? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Ping flooding] Can an attacker send continuous LatencyPing requests with incrementing counters to exhaust the victim's counter tracking storage or response buffering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Amplification ratio] What is the size ratio between serialized request and response for each variant, and can attackers exploit high amplification ratios (e.g., tiny GetNetworkInformation request producing megabyte response) for bandwidth exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Protocol downgrade] If the request enum is extended with new variants in future versions, can attackers exploit nodes that deserialize unknown variants, causing crashes or undefined behavior?

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Response correlation] Does the client properly validate that LatencyPingResponse.ping_counter matches the request's ping_counter, or can attackers send arbitrary responses to poison latency measurements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Enum: PeerMonitoringServiceRequest] [Type mismatch] Can an attacker send a GetNetworkInformation request but respond with a NodeInformationResponse, causing type confusion in the client's response handler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNetworkInformation] [Sybil attack enabler] By allowing any peer to query network information, does this enable Sybil attackers to efficiently map the network and identify connection opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Variant: GetNetworkInformation] [Eclipse attack] Can attackers use GetNetworkInformation responses to identify isolated nodes and launch eclipse attacks by selectively connecting to them? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Timing side channel] Does get_label() execute in constant time, or can timing variations leak information about which request variant is being processed? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/types/src/request.rs] [Struct: LatencyPingRequest] [Counter race] If multiple threads read/write ping_counter concurrently without synchronization, can race conditions cause counter skipping or duplication breaking request correlation? (Medium)",
