  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_in_compiler_mode()] [Address Map Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a malicious PackageInfo with conflicting address_map entries that override critical system addresses (like 0x1) to redirect module resolution to attacker-controlled code, potentially allowing unauthorized access to privileged Move modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_in_compiler_mode()] [Input Validation Bypass] Does the function validate that source.address_map and source_deps.address_map don't contain duplicate or conflicting named addresses that could cause non-deterministic module resolution across different validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_in_compiler_mode()] [Flag Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the skip_attribute_checks parameter combined with crafted known_attributes to bypass critical security attribute validation, allowing deployment of Move modules with invalid or malicious attributes?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_with_options_and_compilation_flags()] [Parser Error Exploitation] When Compiler::run::<PASS_PARSER>() returns Err(diags), the function adds empty aliases and marks all sources as targets - can this lead to incorrect module resolution if an attacker triggers parser errors on specific dependency files? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_with_options_and_compilation_flags()] [Named Address Map Confusion] At lines 184-189, aliases are constructed from parsed_prog.named_address_maps - can conflicting named address definitions between different source files cause non-deterministic address resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_with_options_and_compilation_flags()] [Dependency Classification Attack] The dep_files BTreeSet is built from lib_definitions - can an attacker structure their package to have critical security modules classified as dependencies, causing them to be compiled with relaxed validation?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: run_model_builder_with_options_and_compilation_flags()] [Source File Omission] Lines 201-214 handle files without definitions - can an attacker create empty Move files that should contain security checks, causing them to be skipped in validation while still being referenced by other modules?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: is_vector()] [Address Spoofing] Can an attacker create a module at a different address that also has name 'vector' to confuse module resolution, since the check only validates address == AccountAddress::ONE and name == 'vector'? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: is_vector()] [String Comparison Attack] The module name comparison uses as_str() == 'vector' - is this comparison case-sensitive and Unicode-aware, or can an attacker use homoglyph characters to bypass the check? (Low)",
