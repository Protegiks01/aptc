[
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Error Information Leakage] Does the DiscoveryError::Parsing error expose sensitive information about the file system structure or YAML parsing internals through err.to_string() that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Error State Persistence] If load_file() fails repeatedly, does the Stream maintain the last known good PeerSet, or does it send empty/error states to connectivity manager potentially disconnecting all peers? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [IO Error Handling] Does DiscoveryError::IO differentiate between transient errors (EAGAIN, EINTR) and permanent errors (ENOENT, EACCES), or does it treat all I/O failures equally potentially causing unnecessary service disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Silent Error Suppression] When returning Poll::Ready(Some(Err(error))), is the error properly logged and monitored, or can persistent errors go unnoticed allowing the discovery system to silently fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Interval Manipulation] Can an attacker influence the interval_duration parameter to set extremely short intervals (microseconds) causing I/O storms that degrade validator performance or extremely long intervals (hours) preventing timely peer updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Interval Skipping] If the system is under heavy load and poll_next() processing takes longer than interval_duration, can interval ticks be skipped causing missed peer updates during critical network reconfigurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero Interval DoS] Does the code validate that interval_duration is non-zero and within reasonable bounds, or can a zero/negative duration cause infinite polling loops that freeze the validator? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Time Service Manipulation] If the TimeService is mocked or manipulated (e.g., in testing or through system clock changes), can this cause the interval to behave unexpectedly, either halting updates or causing rapid-fire polling? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Pinning Violation] Does the Pin<&mut Self> contract guarantee memory safety for self.interval during async polling, or can moves/reallocations cause use-after-free or dangling pointer issues? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Reentrancy Attack] If poll_next() is called reentrantly (though unlikely with Pin), can this cause the same file to be read multiple times concurrently, leading to race conditions in file system state? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Struct: FileStream] [Send/Sync Safety] Is FileStream properly marked as Send/Sync, or can improper concurrent access from multiple async tasks cause data races on file_path or interval fields? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Waker Abuse] Can malicious waker implementations or waker poisoning attacks cause poll_next() to be called excessively or never, disrupting the peer discovery timing? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Update Flooding] If the file changes rapidly (multiple times per second), does the Stream send too many UpdateDiscoveredPeers messages to connectivity manager, potentially overwhelming it or causing peer connection churn? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Empty PeerSet Attack] Can an attacker clear the YAML file (empty PeerSet) causing the validator to disconnect from all peers, effectively isolating it from the network and causing liveness failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Peer Set Replacement] When a new PeerSet is sent via UpdateDiscoveredPeers, is there validation that at least some peers overlap with the previous set to prevent complete network isolation? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Discovery Source Trust] Does the connectivity manager properly isolate DiscoverySource::File updates from other discovery sources (DHT, on-chain), or can file-based peers override more trustworthy discovery mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [PathBuf Clone Safety] Does the to_path_buf() clone create a deep copy of the path, or can shared references to the underlying path buffer cause aliasing issues if the original path is modified? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [AsPath Conversion] Is the as_path() conversion in load_file(self.file_path.as_path()) safe against lifetime issues, or can the PathBuf be dropped while the &Path reference is still in use? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Non-Canonical Paths] Does load_file() handle non-canonical paths (with . or .. components) correctly, or can path resolution lead to accessing unintended files? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [YAML Injection] Can an attacker inject YAML directives (e.g., %YAML, %TAG) that cause the parser to behave unexpectedly or execute unintended deserialization logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Anchor Bomb] Can YAML anchor/alias cycles create infinite loops during deserialization, causing the validator to hang indefinitely during peer discovery? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Mixed Content Attack] Can an attacker mix different YAML document separators (---) to inject multiple PeerSets in a single file, causing only the first or last to be processed while hiding malicious peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [String Allocation Attack] Does read_to_string() have a maximum size limit, or can an attacker create a massive file that allocates gigabytes of memory causing OOM kills on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Continuous Error Allocation] If load_file() returns errors continuously, does each error allocation accumulate in memory or message queues, eventually exhausting resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Stack Overflow in Parser] Can deeply nested YAML structures cause stack overflow during recursive parsing in serde_yaml, crashing the validator process? (High)"
