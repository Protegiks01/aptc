  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Panic on Deserialization] Can malformed BCS data from the REST endpoint cause unwrap() or expect() panics during ValidatorSet deserialization, crashing the validator node and causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Validator Set Injection] Can an attacker who controls the REST endpoint inject a completely fabricated ValidatorSet that gets accepted by extract_validator_set_updates, allowing unauthorized nodes to join the validator set and compromise consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Voting Power Manipulation] Can malicious REST data manipulate validator voting powers in the ValidatorSet to exceed the 1/3 Byzantine threshold, allowing attackers to violate consensus safety guarantees and enable double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Empty Validator Set] Can the REST endpoint return an empty ValidatorSet that passes deserialization but causes extract_validator_set_updates to produce an empty PeerSet, resulting in network partition where nodes cannot discover any peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Duplicate Validators] Does extract_validator_set_updates at line 55-58 detect and reject ValidatorSets containing duplicate validator entries, or can duplicates inflate voting power calculations and enable single-validator control of consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Historical State Attack] Can an attacker cause the REST API to return an old ValidatorSet from a previous epoch, causing nodes to connect to outdated validators and creating a split-brain scenario with inconsistent validator sets across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Context Mismatch] Can mismatched network_context between RestStream initialization and actual network usage cause validator set updates to be applied to wrong network IDs, leading to cross-network contamination? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Context Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the network_context passed to extract_validator_set_updates at line 56 to bypass network isolation and inject validators from one network into another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Struct: RestStream] [Context Immutability] Is network_context properly immutable after RestStream construction, or can race conditions allow modification of network_context during poll_next() execution, causing context confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Concurrent Poll Race] Can concurrent calls to poll_next() from multiple tasks cause race conditions in the interval timer at line 44, leading to duplicate REST requests or skipped polls that create inconsistent validator set views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [RestClient State Race] Is the rest_client at line 48 thread-safe for concurrent use, or can race conditions in HTTP connection pooling cause corrupted responses that mix data from different requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Interval Mutation Race] Can the interval at line 34 be safely mutated via as_mut().poll_next() while other fields are accessed, or could race conditions cause use-after-free or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Response Processing Race] Between retrieving ValidatorSet at line 48-51 and calling extract_validator_set_updates at line 55-58, can another thread modify shared state causing inconsistent processing of validator set data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Stale Validator Set] If REST requests consistently fail or timeout, can nodes continue operating with increasingly stale validator sets, eventually causing network partition when the actual validator set changes significantly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Partial Update Race] Can a node receive partial validator set updates if REST requests are interrupted mid-transfer, leading to corrupted BCS data that causes deserialization failures and prevents discovery updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Version Skew Attack] Can different nodes query the REST endpoint at slightly different times and receive different ValidatorSet versions, causing network-wide inconsistency in discovered peers during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Atomic Update Missing] Is the transition from old to new validator set atomic when extract_validator_set_updates returns, or can partial updates create intermediate states where some peers are discovered but others are missing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: new()] [Client Timeout Missing] Does the aptos_rest_client::Client at line 33 have proper timeout configuration, or can hung connections prevent poll_next() from completing and block discovery indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: new()] [Connection Pool Exhaustion] Can the REST client exhaust connection pools if multiple RestStream instances make concurrent requests, leading to connection failures and discovery outages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: new()] [Retry Logic Missing] Does the REST client implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures, or will single network glitches cause extended discovery outages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: new()] [Rate Limiting Bypass] Can an attacker flood the RestStream with rapid polls by manipulating the interval, causing rate limiting on the REST endpoint and preventing legitimate discovery requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Response Memory Leak] Can repeated REST responses containing large ValidatorSet data cause memory leaks if response buffers are not properly deallocated, eventually leading to OOM crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Interval Timer Leak] If the interval timer at line 44 fails to fire or gets stuck, can this cause memory leaks in pending futures that never complete, degrading node performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Struct: RestStream] [Pin Memory Safety] Is the Pin<Box<Interval>> at line 34 safely handled to prevent moving the pinned data, or could unsafe code elsewhere cause undefined behavior through pinning violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/rest.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [ValidatorSet Clone Cost] Does the validator_set.into_inner() at line 54 properly transfer ownership without expensive cloning, or could large validator sets cause performance degradation through unnecessary data copies? (Low)"
