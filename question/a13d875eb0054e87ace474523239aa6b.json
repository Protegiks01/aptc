  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious svg_file_path containing '../' sequences to traverse outside the intended profiler output directory and read arbitrary sensitive files like validator private keys, potentially leading to validator compromise? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Path Traversal] Does the function validate that svg_file_path stays within allowed directories, or can absolute paths like '/etc/passwd' or '/root/.ssh/id_rsa' be passed to leak system configuration or credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symbolic link in the profiler output directory pointing to sensitive validator configuration files, causing convert_svg_to_string() to inadvertently expose private keys or network secrets when the SVG is retrieved? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does fs::read_to_string() impose file size limits, or can an attacker create arbitrarily large SVG files (e.g., multi-GB) causing memory exhaustion and validator node crashes during profiling data collection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker provide a path to a special file like /dev/random or /dev/zero causing fs::read_to_string() to hang indefinitely and block profiler operations or benchmark execution threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Information Disclosure] If svg_file_path points to a non-existent file, does the error message from fs::read_to_string() leak sensitive path information about the validator's file system structure that could aid further attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerability where an attacker can replace the SVG file between path validation (if any) and the actual fs::read_to_string() call, potentially reading unintended files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Unicode/Encoding Attack] Can an attacker craft SVG file paths with Unicode normalization issues (e.g., different Unicode representations of '../') that bypass path validation but still achieve directory traversal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Null Byte Injection] Can an attacker inject null bytes in the path string to truncate path validation checks while still accessing restricted files through the actual file system call? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Permission Bypass] Does the function respect file system permissions, or can it read files that the validator process shouldn't have access to if profiling is run with elevated privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Hard Link Attack] Can an attacker create hard links to sensitive system files in the profiler directory, bypassing symlink detection mechanisms but still exposing protected data through convert_svg_to_string()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [File Descriptor Exhaustion] If multiple concurrent profiling sessions call convert_svg_to_string() on many files, can this exhaust file descriptors causing validator node instability or preventing critical consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Error Information Leak] Does the .map_err(|e| e.into()) conversion preserve detailed I/O error messages that could leak information about validator file system state or directory structure to benchmark clients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [UTF-8 Validation] Does fs::read_to_string() properly validate UTF-8 encoding, or can malformed SVG files with invalid UTF-8 sequences cause panics or memory safety issues in downstream string processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: convert_svg_to_string()] [Memory Safety] Can extremely long single lines in the SVG file (e.g., >1GB single line) cause buffer allocation issues or integer overflows in the String allocation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious path with '../' sequences to create files outside the intended profiler output directory, potentially overwriting critical validator configuration files or consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Arbitrary File Write] Does the function validate output paths, or can absolute paths like '/etc/validator.toml' be used to overwrite system configuration files causing validator misconfiguration or denial of service? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create malicious symbolic links in parent directories causing create_file_with_parents() to write profiler output to unintended locations like validator private key files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Directory Traversal] Can the path.parent() call be exploited with specially crafted paths (e.g., paths ending in '/..') to create directories in unexpected locations or bypass directory restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a race condition between create_dir_all() and File::create() where an attacker can create a symlink in the newly created directory, redirecting file creation to a sensitive location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Does create_file_with_parents() impose limits on directory depth or path length, or can an attacker trigger creation of extremely deep directory hierarchies exhausting inodes or file system metadata space? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Permission Issues] Does create_dir_all() create directories with secure permissions (0700), or can it create world-writable directories allowing other users to inject malicious files into the profiler output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [File Overwrite] Does File::create() silently overwrite existing files, potentially destroying important profiling data or logs without warning if paths collide? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Atomic Operation] Are the create_dir_all() and File::create() operations atomic, or can partial failures leave the file system in an inconsistent state with created directories but no file? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-profiler/src/utils.rs] [Function: create_file_with_parents()] [Special File Creation] Can an attacker provide paths like '/dev/null' or named pipes causing File::create() to fail or behave unexpectedly, potentially disrupting profiling operations? (Low)"
