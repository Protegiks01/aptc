  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: CollectionMutationTranslator] [Sequence number manipulation] Can attackers exploit event ordering to manipulate the sequence_number calculation in get_next_sequence_number(), causing event numbering gaps or duplicates breaking event ordering guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: CollectionMutationTranslator] [EventHandle key collision] Can two collections share the same mutation_events EventHandle key, causing V2-to-V1 translation to mix events from different collections creating cross-collection confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: CollectionMutationTranslator] [Translation data loss] Does the V2-to-V1 translation preserve old_value and new_value data, or are these critical fields dropped during translation causing loss of mutation details in legacy event consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial deserialization] Can try_from_bytes() succeed on truncated or incomplete BCS data, creating partially initialized CollectionMutation structs that cause undefined behavior in downstream processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MUTATION_TYPE] [Lazy initialization race] Can concurrent access to COLLECTION_MUTATION_TYPE during node startup cause race conditions in Lazy::new() initialization, potentially creating multiple TypeTag instances or initialization panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Clone safety] Since CollectionMutation derives Clone, can concurrent cloning of large String fields cause memory safety issues or data races when events are processed by multiple threads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Event processing] [Event ordering] Can parallel transaction execution emit CollectionMutation events out of chronological order for the same collection, breaking mutation history reconstruction in indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: new()] [Unrestricted construction] Since new() is public and has no validation, can any code create CollectionMutation instances with fake data, potentially injecting false events if event emission controls are bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Move framework] [Emission authorization] Does the Move collection module properly verify that only the collection owner/authorized mutator can emit CollectionMutation events, or can unauthorized accounts emit fake mutation events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Event emission] [Signer verification] When collection.move emits Mutation events, does it verify the signer has MutatorRef capabilities, or can attackers call set_name/set_description/set_uri on collections they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Memory amplification] Can an attacker create many collections and emit millions of CollectionMutation events with large strings, exhausting storage in AptosDB's event tables or indexer databases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Allocation attack] Can malicious BCS-encoded data trigger excessive memory allocations during deserialization (e.g., claiming gigabyte string lengths), causing OOM crashes in event processors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Event accumulation] Do indexers properly limit or prune historical CollectionMutation events, or can unbounded event accumulation over time exhaust storage and degrade query performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: State proof] [Event inclusion] Are CollectionMutation events properly included in the event accumulator and Merkle tree, or can events be emitted without proper state commitment allowing unverifiable mutations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Event replay] [Deterministic encoding] Is BCS serialization deterministic for CollectionMutation, or can different serializations of identical events cause hash mismatches breaking event proof verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error propagation] Does try_from_bytes() properly map all BCS deserialization errors to anyhow::Result, or can certain error conditions cause unwrap() panics in caller code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Translator] [Graceful degradation] When CollectionMutationTranslator returns an error for 'Collection resource not found', does the indexer skip or retry the event, and can this be exploited to suppress events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Field addition] If new fields are added to CollectionMutation in future versions, will old nodes fail to deserialize events causing network splits between upgraded and non-upgraded validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Field removal] If fields are removed from CollectionMutation, can events serialized by new code be rejected by old code, breaking event synchronization during rolling upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Static: COLLECTION_MUTATION_TYPE] [Module upgrade] If the collection module at TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS is upgraded with breaking changes, can existing CollectionMutation events become unprocessable requiring manual migration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Provenance tracking] Can attackers emit false CollectionMutation events claiming collections had different names/descriptions in the past, manipulating provenance verification used by NFT marketplaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Fields: old_value/new_value] [Audit log tampering] Can collection owners emit mutation events with crafted old_value fields to hide previous controversial names/descriptions, circumventing audit trails for content moderation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Analytics] [Metric manipulation] Can attackers game collection activity metrics by repeatedly mutating fields back and forth (A→B→A→B), inflating event counts without meaningful changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Zero-length strings] Are empty strings ('') valid for mutated_field_name, old_value, or new_value, and can they cause indexing failures, UI rendering issues, or break event filtering logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Zero address] Can the Object field reference address 0x0, and does this cause crashes in get_state_value_bytes_for_object_group_resource() when looking up non-existent resources? (Medium)"
