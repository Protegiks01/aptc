  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Port value tampering] Between when ports are sent on channels and when they're used in health checkers, can an attacker modify the port values to redirect health checks to malicious services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Thread spawn failure] If thread::spawn fails (unlikely but possible under resource exhaustion), does the function handle this gracefully or leak resources from the already-created config and channels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Thread panic handling] If the spawned node thread panics, is the panic properly propagated to the calling code, or could it leave orphaned futures waiting on channels that will never receive values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Config clone cost] The NodeConfig is cloned before being moved into the thread closure - for large configs, could this create performance issues or enable timing attacks based on config size? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Closure move semantics] The run_node closure moves test_dir and node_config - can this create use-after-move issues if the original variables are accessed elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Thread join safety] The thread handle is never joined - could this lead to resource leaks or prevent proper cleanup when the node should shut down? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Polling loop overhead] The fut_node_finish future polls is_finished() every 200ms in a tight loop - can this consume excessive CPU resources or create timing vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Thread completion detection] The is_finished() check is the only way to detect node failure - can a hung thread (not finished, not running) cause this future to loop forever without detecting problems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Error propagation loss] When the node finishes unexpectedly, only a generic bail! message is returned - is the actual error from the thread lost, preventing proper debugging of security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Tokio sleep timing] The 200ms sleep interval could create timing windows where state changes are missed - can this enable race conditions in node startup sequencing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Port receive failure] If api_port_rx.await fails (channel closed without sending), does the error propagation correctly indicate the root cause, or is it masked by the await? operator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [URL construction vulnerability] The API URL is constructed without validating the received port - can a malicious port value (0, 65535, etc.) create invalid URLs or SSRF opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Health checker bypass] The HealthChecker::NodeApi waits with no timeout specified (None) - can a slow or malicious API endpoint cause this future to hang indefinitely, preventing node startup detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [URL parse panic] The Url::parse with format! uses unwrap() - can malformed IP_LOCAL_HOST or port values cause a panic during health check setup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Print timing leak] The no_panic_println! outputs the exact port and timing of when the API becomes ready - could this create timing side-channels in multi-tenant environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Indexer port validation] The indexer_grpc_port is received from a channel and used directly - can an attacker who compromises start_and_report_ports send malicious port values to redirect data service connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Data service URL construction] The get_data_service_url function is called with potentially untrusted port - can this create exploitable URLs if the port value is crafted maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [gRPC health check timeout] Like the API health checker, no timeout is specified - can a hanging gRPC service prevent the node from ever becoming ready, causing permanent unavailability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Transaction stream readiness] The health checker verifies the transaction stream - if this passes but the stream is actually corrupted or malicious, can invalid transactions enter the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Output information disclosure] Printing the exact indexer gRPC endpoint could leak network topology information in shared development environments - is this a privacy concern? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Future execution order] The three returned futures are independent - can they execute in unexpected orders causing state inconsistencies, like the node finishing before health checks complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Resource cleanup] If any future fails, are the spawned thread and other resources properly cleaned up, or can this leak threads and file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Async runtime dependency] The futures assume a Tokio runtime - if called from a different runtime or without one, can this cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Error type information loss] All errors are converted to anyhow::Result - can this lose type information needed for proper error handling in security-critical paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [start_and_report_ports security] The function delegates to start_and_report_ports from aptos-node - if that function has vulnerabilities in port reporting or initialization, are they inherited here? (High)"
