  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Byzantine validator] [Time desynchronization] Could a Byzantine validator with < 1/3 stake manipulate their local Interval timing to remain slightly out of sync with honest validators, creating optimal conditions for equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Byzantine validator] [Selective delays] Could a malicious validator selectively delay their own Interval ticks for certain rounds but not others, manipulating which proposals they vote on? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Byzantine validator] [Interval cloning] Could a Byzantine validator create multiple Interval instances for the same logical timeout, allowing them to receive timeout signals at different times and act ambiguously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Byzantine validator] [Custom Sleep implementation] Could a malicious validator replace the standard Sleep implementation with a custom one that provides biased timing signals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Polling storm] Could rapid repeated polling of an Interval cause CPU exhaustion, especially if many Intervals are polled in a tight loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Timer wheel saturation] If many Intervals with different periods are created, could this saturate the underlying timer system (tokio timer wheel) and cause timing inaccuracies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Struct: Interval] [Instance proliferation] Could creating thousands of Interval instances (e.g., one per peer in a large network) cause memory or file descriptor exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Documentation] [API contract] The comments reference tokio::time::Interval behavior, but do they accurately describe safety guarantees? Could misunderstandings lead to incorrect usage in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [Documentation] [FusedStream contract] The is_terminated() documentation says the stream never ends, but could this mislead developers into not handling Interval drops properly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-time-service/src/interval.rs] [API design] [Type safety] Should Interval be a newtype wrapper to prevent confusion with other interval types, or could the current design allow mixing incompatible interval implementations? (Low)"
