  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_module_blob()] [Module Serialization Bugs] Does serialize() for CompiledModule properly validate that all function bytecode is within bounds, or can out-of-bounds instruction pointers be serialized? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_module_blob()] [Blob Integrity] Is there any integrity check (e.g., checksum) on the serialized module blob to detect corruption during transmission, or can attackers inject malicious bytecode into serialized modules? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_mod()] [Dependency Resolution] When compile_module() uses self.deps.iter().copied(), are dependency versions properly checked, or can attackers compile against outdated vulnerable dependency versions? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_script_blob()] [Partial Compilation] If compile_script() succeeds but serialize() fails, can this leave partially constructed state in memory that interferes with future compilations in the same process? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_module_blob()] [Serialization Failure Handling] What happens if serialize() runs out of memory mid-serialization - can this corrupt the Vec<u8> buffer with partial data that appears valid but is actually truncated? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [All Functions] [Panic Safety] If any of the unwrap() calls in the underlying parser or compiler panic, can this leave the validator in an inconsistent state or cause the entire node to crash? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [All Functions] [Result Propagation] Are all Result types properly propagated with ?, or can some error conditions cause silent failures where invalid bytecode is generated without errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_compiled_script_and_source_map()] [Code Injection] Can an attacker inject special characters or escape sequences in the IR code string that are interpreted as compiler directives, altering the compilation behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_script_blob()] [Unicode Exploitation] Does the parser handle all Unicode code points safely, or can specially crafted Unicode characters in identifiers cause buffer overflows or encoding issues in the compiled bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_module_blob()] [Null Byte Injection] Can an attacker include null bytes in module names or identifiers that truncate strings unexpectedly, causing module identity spoofing or verification bypass? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_mod()] [Identifier Validation] Does parse_module() validate that module and function names conform to Move's identifier rules, or can reserved keywords or system identifiers be used maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_script()] [Instruction Encoding] Can malicious IR cause compile_script() to generate invalid Move bytecode instructions that pass verification but cause VM crashes during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_script()] [Stack Manipulation] Can crafted IR compile into bytecode with unbalanced stack operations (e.g., more pops than pushes) that corrupt the VM stack and enable arbitrary memory access? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_script()] [Jump Target Validation] Does the compiler ensure all branch and jump targets in generated bytecode point to valid instruction boundaries, or can malicious IR create jumps into the middle of instructions?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/lib.rs] [Function: compile_mod()] [Local Variable Overflow] Can IR with excessive local variables cause the compiler to generate bytecode with overflowed local indices, corrupting the VM's local variable storage? (High)",
