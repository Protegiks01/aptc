  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: module_id_for_handle()] [Cross-module reference] Line 211 creates ModuleId from handle - can handles reference modules that don't exist or haven't been loaded yet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: immediate_dependencies()] [Dependency versioning] Lines 222-229 return dependencies without version info - can modules depend on incompatible versions of the same module? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: signatures()] [Signature reuse] Line 183 exposes signature pool - can signatures be reused in incompatible contexts causing type system violations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: self_handle_idx()] [Self-reference cycle] Line 22 returns self module handle index - can this index point to a handle that points back to itself creating cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: struct_def_at()] [Definition index overflow] Line 125 accesses struct_defs - can struct definition indices be manipulated to access beyond the array in unsafe code contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: constant_pool()] [Large constant DoS] Line 187 exposes entire constant pool - can modules with gigabyte-sized constants cause memory exhaustion during loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: identifiers()] [Identifier deduplication bypass] Line 191 returns identifiers - can duplicate identifiers bypass deduplication causing unnecessary memory usage? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Trait: ScriptAccess] [Script isolation] Lines 284-385 define script accessors - can scripts access module internals through trait methods that should be module-private? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: as_module()] [Module mutability] Line 19 returns immutable reference - can the underlying CompiledModule be mutated through other interfaces during access causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: as_script()] [Script lifecycle] Line 286 returns script reference - what prevents scripts from being modified during execution causing undefined behavior? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: module_handle_at()] [Index type size] Line 44 converts ModuleHandleIndex to usize - can this conversion fail or produce unexpected results on 16-bit or 32-bit platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/access.rs] [Function: friend_decls()] [Transitive friends] Line 207 returns direct friends - can transitive friend relationships be exploited to gain indirect access to private functions? (Medium)",
