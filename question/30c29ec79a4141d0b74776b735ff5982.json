  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Panic Safety] If serialization or sending panics inside spawn_blocking, does it poison the thread pool or cause cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [GC Timing] Is garbage_collection_interval_ms synchronized with subscription additions, or can rapid subscribe/unsubscribe cycles exploit timing windows to maintain invalid subscriptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Publication Latency] Can slow serialization for one peer block message delivery to other peers, causing observers to receive updates out of sync with consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Metrics Race] Can the metric update at the end of GC race with concurrent subscription changes, reporting incorrect subscriber counts? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Struct: ConsensusPublisher] [HashSet DoS] Does the HashSet implementation for active_subscribers use a randomized hasher to prevent hash collision DoS attacks when many peers subscribe? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Set Operations] Are the difference() and clone() operations on large HashSets atomic, or can concurrent modifications during these operations cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: get_active_subscribers()] [Memory Amplification] Does cloning the HashSet on every read amplify memory usage, allowing attackers to trigger OOM by rapidly querying active subscribers? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Message Type Confusion] Can different ConsensusObserverDirectSend message types (OrderedBlock, BlockPayload, CommitDecision) be mixed or reordered in ways that violate observer protocol semantics? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Type-Specific Serialization] If different message types require different serialization strategies, can type confusion attacks cause observers to misinterpret message contents? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Message Label] Does message.get_label() provide accurate type information for metrics, or can mislabeled messages cause incorrect monitoring and alerting? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Metadata Trust] Does the publisher trust ConnectionMetadata from peers without validation, allowing attackers to manipulate metadata to avoid garbage collection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Connection State] Can peers manipulate their ConnectionState to appear connected while actually being malicious or disconnected, maintaining subscriptions indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Peer Verification] Are peer identities cryptographically verified before accepting subscriptions, or can Sybil attacks create many fake subscribers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Graceful Shutdown] When the publisher loop exits unexpectedly, are all active subscribers notified or do they remain subscribed to a dead publisher? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Resource Finalization] Does the else branch that exits the loop properly close channels and release locks before returning, or can resource leaks occur? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Task Orphaning] If the publisher is dropped while serialization tasks are running, can orphaned tasks continue consuming resources indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Backpressure Handling] Does the serialization pipeline handle backpressure from slow peers, or can one slow observer block message delivery to all other subscribers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Channel Backpressure] When outbound_message_sender is full, try_send() fails silently - can this cause unbounded message loss without triggering subscriber removal? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Buffering Limits] Does buffered(max_parallel_serialization_tasks) properly limit in-flight messages, or can memory exhaustion occur if serialization is slower than message production? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Response Deadlock] Can the ResponseSender::send() call block if the receiver is not consuming responses, causing the publisher to hang? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Response Ordering] Are SubscribeAck and UnsubscribeAck responses guaranteed to arrive in order, or can reordering cause peers to misinterpret subscription state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [ACK Timeout] If peers never process ACK responses, can this cause resource exhaustion in the response channel or network layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Consensus Coupling] Does tight coupling between consensus and publisher mean consensus could be blocked by slow observer message publication? (Critical)",
