  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 55: Path::push()] [Path concatenation safety] Does push() properly sanitize the appended path component 'aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework', or could it be manipulated if aptos_core_path() returns unexpected values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Lazy initialization timing] [Startup performance] Could malformed YAML that causes slow parsing during Lazy initialization create a denial of service during application startup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Public API] [Least privilege violation] Should current_release_config() be accessible to all callers, or should it be restricted to privileged operations like proposal generation and validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Path functions] [Filesystem access implications] Do aptos_core_path() and aptos_framework_path() grant implicit filesystem access to callers who might not need it, violating principle of least privilege? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Module initialization] [Initialization privilege] Does initialize_aptos_core_path() require special privileges to call, or can any code override the core path, potentially redirecting to malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Canonical paths] [Cross-node consistency] If different validator nodes have different filesystem layouts or symlink structures, could canonicalize() produce different paths, breaking deterministic proposal generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Static configuration] [Multi-binary consistency] If different binaries (validators, full nodes, tools) compile with different RELEASE_CONFIG values, could this cause consensus divergence or proposal validation failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Path resolution timing] [TOCTOU consistency] Between getting a path from aptos_framework_path() and actually reading files at that location, could the filesystem change, causing consistency issues in proposal generation? (Medium)"
