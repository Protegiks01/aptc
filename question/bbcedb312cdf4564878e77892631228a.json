  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Key material exposure] Does the function ensure safety_rules_config contains properly encrypted key material, or can key storage be accessed in plaintext by unauthorized processes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [NetworkTask channel mismatch] The network_receiver is passed to epoch_manager.start() but created from NetworkTask.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TConsensusManager] [Implementation divergence] Can different implementations of TConsensusManager have inconsistent behavior regarding oidc_providers and observed_jwks handling, causing validator disagreement on JWK state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TConsensusManager] [Close signal race condition] The close_rx oneshot::Receiver is used to shutdown consensus.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TConsensusManager] [Channel parameter validation] Does TConsensusManager::run() validate that jwk_updated_rx and rpc_req_rx have appropriate queue depths and policies, or can misconfiguration cause message loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TConsensusManager] [None option handling] If oidc_providers or observed_jwks are None, does the implementation safely handle this edge case, or can it panic/crash causing validator unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TConsensusManager] [Async trait Send+Sync violation] The trait requires Send+Sync. Can implementations violate these bounds through interior mutability (RefCell, etc.) causing data races in multi-threaded runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Memory leak] Are all channels (self_sender, network_receiver) properly dropped when the runtime shuts down, or do they leak memory accumulating over multiple epoch transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Runtime thread leak] Does the 4-thread runtime properly shutdown all threads when dropped, or can threads persist as zombies consuming resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_jwk_consensus_runtime()] [Handle exhaustion] Can repeated calls to spawn() on the runtime exhaust OS task handles on the validator node, preventing other critical consensus tasks from running? (Medium)",
