  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: parent_id()] [Circular dependency] Can a DAGBlock's parent_block_id point to itself or create circular parent chains, breaking the block tree invariants and causing infinite loops during traversal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: parent_id()] [Cross-epoch parent] Can parent_id() return a block ID from a different epoch than the current block, allowing invalid cross-epoch parent references? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: payload()] [Empty payload confusion] Does returning None for Genesis and NilBlock (line 175) create vulnerabilities where empty payloads are confused with missing payloads, potentially bypassing transaction execution validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: payload()] [Payload consistency] For ProposalExt and OptimisticProposal (lines 173-174), payload is obtained through method calls.

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: validator_txns()] [DAGBlock validator txns] DAGBlock returns validator_txns directly (line 184). Are these properly validated before execution, or can Byzantine validators inject malicious system transactions? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: failed_authors()] [OptimisticProposal exclusion] Why does OptimisticProposal return None for failed_authors (line 232)? Can this be exploited to hide validator failures in optimistic execution mode? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: failed_authors()] [Round gaps] Are the rounds in failed_authors tuples (Round, Author) properly validated to be consecutive, or can gaps in rounds hide validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: failed_authors()] [Duplicate authors] Can the same author appear multiple times in failed_authors for different rounds, and is this properly handled in reward/penalty calculations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/block_data.rs] [Function: new_genesis_from_ledger_info()] [Parent ID manipulation] Genesis uses HashValue::zero() as parent block id (line 241).
