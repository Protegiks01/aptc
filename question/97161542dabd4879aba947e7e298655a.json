  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Signature forgery] Is the BLS12381 signature in ObservedUpdate properly verified before accepting observed JWKs, or can a Byzantine validator forge signatures for arbitrary ProviderJWKs to inject malicious authentication keys?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Signature malleability] Are BLS12381 signatures canonicalized to prevent malleability attacks where the same semantic signature has multiple valid representations, enabling double-voting or quorum manipulation?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdate] [Signature domain separation] Do signatures use proper domain separation to prevent cross-protocol signature reuse, or can signatures from other Aptos subsystems be replayed as JWK consensus signatures? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Function: JWKConsensusMsg::epoch()] [Epoch confusion] Can an attacker send messages with future epoch numbers to cause validators to accept JWK updates before epoch transitions are finalized, creating state inconsistencies? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateResponse] [Epoch-response mismatch] Is there validation that ObservedUpdateResponse.epoch matches the original request epoch, or can attackers return responses from different epochs causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [Epoch boundary race] During epoch transitions, can concurrent ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest messages from old and new epochs be processed simultaneously, causing quorum certificates to mix validator sets?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedUpdateResponse] [Stale epoch acceptance] Are there timeout mechanisms to reject ObservedUpdateResponse messages from significantly old epochs, or can attackers flood nodes with historical data to cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/types.rs] [Struct: ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest] [Epoch skip attack] Can Byzantine validators skip epoch numbers in ObservedKeyLevelUpdateRequest to bypass incremental validation logic and force acceptance of malicious key updates? (High)",
