  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::from_bytes_unchecked()] [Library Trust Boundary] Does the code validate that slh_keygen_internal at line 88 produces valid keys, or does it blindly trust the library output which could be malicious if the slh_dsa dependency is compromised? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Import: slh_dsa::signature::Signer] [Trait Method Safety] Are all methods from the imported Signer trait at line 98 safe to use with untrusted input, or could certain message patterns trigger panics or undefined behavior in the underlying library? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: Uniform::generate()] [RNG Coupling] Is the code tightly coupled to specific RNG implementations through the RngAdapter, making it impossible to substitute different entropy sources without risking key generation compatibility issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Struct: PrivateKey] [Type Confusion] Can PrivateKey be coerced or transmuted into other types through unsafe code elsewhere in the codebase, bypassing the type system and allowing raw manipulation of sensitive key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Trait: SigningKey] [Generic Constraints] Are the trait bounds at lines 133-151 sufficient to prevent misuse, or can an attacker instantiate SigningKey with unexpected types that bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Trait: VerifyingKey] [Associated Type Safety] Can the associated types SignatureMaterial and SigningKeyMaterial at lines 249-252 be manipulated to create type confusion where signatures from one scheme validate against keys from another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: SigningKey::sign()] [CryptoHash Bypass] Can an attacker implement a malicious CryptoHash trait that produces predictable hashes, then use this to generate signatures that appear valid but are actually forged? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Trait: Uniform] [RNG Type Confusion] Can the complex RNG trait bounds at lines 157-158 be satisfied by a deterministic generator that appears random but actually produces predictable key sequences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/slh_dsa_sha2_128s/slh_dsa_keys.rs] [Function: PrivateKey::sign_arbitrary_message()] [Validator Impersonation] If a Byzantine validator obtains another validator's private key through this implementation's vulnerabilities, can they forge consensus messages to cause safety violations like double-spending or chain splits? (Critical)"
