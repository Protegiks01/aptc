  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/split_critical_edges_processor.rs] [Function: process()] [State mutation] Can an attacker craft malicious bytecode that causes std::mem::take() on data.code to leave data in an invalid state, leading to incorrect bytecode compilation that could enable fund theft when executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/split_critical_edges_processor.rs] [Function: process()] [Precondition bypass] Does the check_precondition() call only execute in debug builds or with debug logging enabled, allowing malicious bytecode with call instructions containing abort actions to bypass validation in production releases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/split_critical_edges_processor.rs] [Function: process()] [Native function handling] Can an attacker exploit the early return for native functions to inject malicious bytecode that skips critical edge splitting, potentially creating control flow vulnerabilities in compiled Move contracts?
