  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_prove()] [Zero-Knowledge Property] Does the proof maintain zero-knowledge property when `r` is randomly chosen, or can the proof structure leak information about `a` beyond what's revealed by `pk = g^a`? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Soundness Reduction] Does batch verification maintain the same soundness error as individual verification, or does batching introduce a security degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_prove()] [Proof of Knowledge Soundness] Can an attacker create a valid-looking proof `(R, s)` without knowing the witness `a`, exploiting discrete log problem hardness? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Mixed Field Operations] If scalars and group elements come from different algebraic structures, can type system allow mixing incompatible fields causing verification errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Multi-Exp Implementation] Does `Gr::multi_exp_iter()` at line 104 implement secure multi-exponentiation, or can implementation bugs allow malicious inputs to produce incorrect results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Multi-Exp Optimization] If multi-exponentiation uses optimizations like Pippenger's algorithm, can these optimizations introduce side-channel vulnerabilities or correctness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Iterator Consumption] The `bases.iter()` and `exps.iter()` at line 104 must yield same length. Can iterator length mismatch cause undefined behavior or verification bypass? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_prove()] [Caller Responsibility] The function trusts caller to provide correct `(a, g, pk)` relationship. Can callers misuse this API to generate proofs for unrelated statements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Verification Context] The verification doesn't take a context parameter beyond the implicit challenge computation. Can this allow proofs to be valid in unintended contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/schnorr.rs] [Function: pok_batch_verify()] [Computational DoS] Can an attacker force validators to perform expensive multi-exponentiation by submitting many invalid proofs that must be batch verified? (Medium)",
