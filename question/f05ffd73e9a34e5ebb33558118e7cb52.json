  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Config Hot Reload] If RocksdbConfig is reloaded dynamically while validators are running, can changes to these options cause database reopening or state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Backup Compatibility] Do these options affect the format or compatibility of database backups? Can changing options prevent restoring from older backups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Compaction Interaction] Can max_open_files limit prevent RocksDB from opening all files needed for compaction, causing compaction to stall and disk space to fill up? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Write Stall] If max_total_wal_size is too small relative to write throughput, can this cause write stalls that delay consensus block commits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: convert_stats_level()] [Enum Extension] If new statistics levels are added to RocksDB in future versions, will the current conversion logic cause runtime errors or use incorrect defaults? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Monotonicity] If config values are changed over time (e.g., increasing max_open_files), does RocksDB handle these changes gracefully, or can they cause database reopening failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Error Propagation] If RocksDB initialization fails due to invalid options, is the error properly propagated to the caller, or can the validator continue with a partially initialized database? (Critical)"
