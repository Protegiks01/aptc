  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_account_range_proof()] [HashValue Validation] Is the HashValue parameter validated before being formatted as hex in line 101, or can invalid hash values cause formatting errors or injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Status Code Handling] The error_for_status() in line 68 treats 4xx/5xx as errors - can an attacker use specific status codes to trigger different error paths and leak information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Redirect Following] Does the reqwest client follow HTTP redirects by default, allowing an attacker to redirect backup requests to arbitrary servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Content-Type Validation] Is the Content-Type header validated to ensure the backup service is returning the expected BCS-encoded data format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_account_range_proof()] [Hash Format] The HashValue is formatted as hex with {:x} in line 101 - can this formatting be exploited with crafted hash values containing non-hex characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_root_proof()] [Root Verification] Are state root proofs verified before being used, or can an attacker provide proofs for a different state root that passes verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_account_range_proof()] [Proof Completeness] Does the range proof verification ensure all accounts in the range are included, or can gaps be exploited to hide account data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Cross-Version Chunks] If chunks from different versions are mixed in a restore operation, can this create a Frankenstein state that passes validation but is internally inconsistent? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_db_state()] [Stale Metadata] Can an attacker provide DbState metadata from an old version that causes validators to make incorrect assumptions about the current blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Missing Metadata] If transaction metadata (signatures, timestamps) is missing from the backup stream, can restored validators accept invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Max Chunk Size] What is the maximum chunk size that can be requested - can usize::MAX be used to trigger integer overflows in size calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Genesis Transactions] How are genesis transactions (version 0) handled - can they be omitted from backups, breaking validators that need to verify chain history from genesis? (High)"
