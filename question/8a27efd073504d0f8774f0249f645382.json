  "[File: third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/references.rs] [Function: BorrowEdgeSet::remove()] [Remove from overflown set] What happens when trying to remove a specific edge from an overflown set that has been reduced to a single weak edge? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-borrow-graph/src/references.rs] [Function: BorrowEdgeSet::remove()] [Debug assertion failure] The debug assertion at line 121 expects removal to succeed - can this be violated in release builds causing silent failures? (Medium)",
