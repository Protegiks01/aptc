  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull_internal()] [Size calculations] Are max_txns, max_txns_after_filtering, and soft_max_txns_after_filtering bounds-checked to prevent integer overflow in size calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Error masking] At line 123, pull_internal() errors are propagated with ? - can critical errors (e.g., channel disconnection) be masked as transient errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull_internal()] [Anyhow conversion] At lines 74 and 83, errors are converted to anyhow::Error - does this lose type information needed for proper error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Fail point errors] At line 104, fail point returns anyhow::Error - can this be distinguished from real errors or does it cause incorrect error handling in tests? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Log information leak] At lines 130-138, info! logs pull_params and payload_len - can this leak sensitive information (e.g., transaction data, validator identities)? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Metric accuracy] At line 101, WAIT_FOR_FULL_BLOCKS_TRIGGERED observes 1.0 or 0.0 - is this accurate? Can return_non_full change between observation and actual pull_internal call? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Combined liveness attack] Can attacker combine empty payload responses, timeout manipulation, and threshold gaming to force consensus into perpetual empty block creation halting network? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull_internal()] [Payload poisoning] Can malicious quorum store inject transactions with invalid proofs/signatures into payload that pass initial validation but fail later, causing consensus state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Functions: pull() + pull_internal()] [Resource exhaustion chain] By setting pull_timeout_ms to maximum, max_poll_time to maximum, and returning empty payloads, can attacker force validators into hour-long blocking calls?

  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/user/quorum_store_client.rs] [Function: pull()] [Consensus fork] If different validators receive different payloads due to timing races in retry loop, can this cause validators to propose different blocks at same round creating fork? (Critical)"
