(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: activation_time_on(), Lines 102-109] [Testnet-mainnet time gap] FixMemoryUsageTracking activates on March 7 for testnet and March 11 for mainnet - is this 4-day gap sufficient to catch bugs on testnet, or could a critical bug discovered after testnet activation still impact mainnet? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: activation_time_on(), Lines 119-126] [Chain-specific activation] DisabledCaptureOption activates at BEGINNING_OF_TIME on MAINNET but has future dates on TESTNET - could this inconsistency cause feature behavior differences that break cross-chain smart contract compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: activation_time_on(), Lines 81-88] [Pacific timezone dependency] Multiple features use Los_Angeles.with_ymd_and_hms() for activation times - if the chrono_tz library has bugs in DST handling, could features activate 1 hour early/late causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: new(), Lines 152-164] [Timestamp source validation] The timestamp_micros parameter is user-provided - if validators use different timestamp sources (system clock vs block timestamp), could clock skew cause validators to disagree on which features are enabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: enable_all(), Lines 166-171] [Unrestricted enable] enable_all() creates a builder that enables all features - if this is accidentally used in production instead of new(), could experimental features activate prematurely causing consensus breaks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Struct: TimedFeaturesBuilder, Lines 145-148] [Builder state mutation] TimedFeaturesBuilder stores inner and override_ fields - if this builder is cloned and mutated by multiple threads before build(), could race conditions produce inconsistent TimedFeatures instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: build(), Lines 201-208] [Build idempotency] Is build() idempotent - if called multiple times on the same builder, will it always produce identical results, or could internal state mutations cause different outputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: with_override_profile(), Lines 173-178] [Builder chaining] The builder pattern allows chaining - if multiple with_override_profile() calls are chained, does the last one win, and could this create confusion where earlier overrides are silently discarded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: is_enabled(), Lines 181-199] [Determinism guarantee] All validators must compute is_enabled() identically - if floating-point arithmetic, timezone conversion, or chrono library version differences exist, could validators fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: activation_time_on(), Lines 72-141] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] The match statement handles TESTNET, MAINNET explicitly and uses _ for others - if a new NamedChain variant is added, will it safely default to BEGINNING_OF_TIME, or could pattern matching fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: new(), Line 153] [ChainId parsing] NamedChain::from_chain_id() is called without error handling beyond Err(_) - if this function panics on malformed input, could malicious transactions crash validators? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/timed_features.rs] [Function: activation_time_on(), Line 84] [with_timezone conversion] .with_timezone(&Utc) converts Los_Angeles time to UTC - if the chrono_tz database is outdated with incorrect DST rules, could this cause activation time errors?
