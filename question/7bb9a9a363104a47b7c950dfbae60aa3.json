  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Function: create_transaction_deduper()] [Feature flag] Is the deduper selection controlled by an on-chain feature flag, and could a malicious governance proposal toggle the feature repeatedly to cause instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper] [Mempool bypass] If mempool already deduplicates transactions, could consensus-level deduplication be redundant, or is it required to handle malicious proposers who include duplicates intentionally? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper::dedup()] [Mempool ordering] Could differences between mempool deduplication logic and consensus deduplication logic cause transactions to be ordered differently, breaking transaction dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper::dedup()] [Malicious proposer] Can a Byzantine block proposer craft a block with carefully ordered duplicates such that deduplication on different validators filters different transactions, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper] [Non-deterministic filtering] Could a Byzantine validator implement a custom TransactionDeduper that returns different results for the same input, and would the consensus protocol detect and reject such behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Function: create_transaction_deduper()] [Implementation substitution] Could a compromised validator binary replace the TxnHashAndAuthenticatorDeduper implementation with a backdoored version that selectively allows certain duplicates through? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper] [Shuffler ordering] In BlockPreparer, deduplication happens before shuffling - could this ordering allow duplicate transactions that should be filtered to influence the shuffling algorithm's randomness or output? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper::dedup()] [Ordering preservation] Does dedup() guarantee that the relative order of non-duplicate transactions is preserved, or could reordering break the fairness guarantees of the transaction shuffler? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Module: txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper] [Hash algorithm] Does the committed_hash() function use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm, or could preimage attacks allow an attacker to craft transactions with identical hashes to legitimate transactions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Module: txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper] [Authenticator equality] Does authenticator comparison use constant-time equality to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about which transactions are duplicates? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper::dedup()] [Transaction size variance] Could a block containing both very small and very large transactions cause deduplication to behave inconsistently due to memory or CPU constraints? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Function: NoOpDeduper::dedup()] [Return value optimization] Does NoOpDeduper's direct return of the input vector rely on move semantics, or could it cause unnecessary copies in certain compiler optimization levels? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Module: txn_hash_and_authenticator_deduper] [HashSet capacity] Does the seen_hashes HashSet pre-allocate capacity based on the input size, or could dynamic growth during iteration cause performance degradation for large blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper] [Consensus invariant] Is deterministic deduplication across all validators a critical consensus invariant, and if deduplication results diverge, would this be detected before execution or cause silent state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Function: create_transaction_deduper()] [Runtime switching] Could the deduper type be switched at runtime within an epoch, and if so, would this cause some blocks to be deduplicated differently than others, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_deduper.rs] [Trait: TransactionDeduper::dedup()] [Timeout handling] If deduplication takes longer than expected (e.g., due to a degenerate case), could this cause the consensus round to timeout, affecting liveness? (High)"
