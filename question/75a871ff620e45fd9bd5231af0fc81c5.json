  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Function: dump_heap_profile()] [SystemTime panic] Can duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) at line 54 panic if SystemTime is set to before Unix epoch, crashing the validator when attempting to dump profiles? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Global: Error messages] [Panic in format] Can the error formatting at lines 41 and 73 using format! macro panic if the error type doesn't implement Display properly, causing validator crash? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Function: get_jemalloc_stats_string()] [Timing oracle] Does the time taken by malloc_stats_print vary based on memory allocation patterns, potentially leaking information about when validators allocate memory for consensus operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Function: dump_heap_profile()] [File creation timing] Can the time between checking the timestamp and creating the profile file reveal information about concurrent operations, potentially leaking consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Function: handle_malloc_stats_request()] [Response size correlation] Does the size of the stats response correlate with sensitive operations, allowing attackers to infer validator activity by monitoring response sizes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Global: /tmp usage] [Container isolation] In containerized deployments, does /tmp at line 12 properly isolate heap profiles between containers, or can profiles leak across container boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Global: /tmp usage] [tmpfs limitations] If /tmp is mounted as tmpfs with size limits, can heap profile dumps exceed the filesystem capacity causing validator operations to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Global: Jemalloc version] [Version compatibility] Are the jemalloc FFI calls compatible across all jemalloc versions used in production, or can version mismatches cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/malloc.rs] [Global: FFI safety] [Cross-compilation] Are the C FFI signatures at lines 8, 14 correct for all target platforms (x86_64, ARM), or can platform-specific ABI differences cause crashes? (Medium)"
