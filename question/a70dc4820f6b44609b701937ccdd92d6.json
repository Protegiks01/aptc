  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Node API trust] Does the code validate the node API's responses to ensure they haven't been tampered with, or does it blindly trust all data from the API endpoint potentially enabling transaction manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Indexer dependency] Although fut_indexer_grpc is awaited, its port is never used - does the faucet actually require the indexer to function, or is this a false dependency that could be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [API version mismatch] Can version mismatches between the faucet and node API cause silent transaction failures or unexpected behavior that could be exploited for fund theft? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Network partition] If the node API or indexer becomes unavailable after the faucet starts, does the faucet handle this gracefully or continue attempting operations that will always fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Dependency injection] Can an attacker control the fut_node_api or fut_indexer_grpc parameters to inject malicious futures that compromise the faucet's operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Unwrap panic] The Url::parse().unwrap() call at line 47 can panic if URL construction fails - can an attacker trigger this panic to crash the faucet service causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Send/Sync violations] Are the generic Future types properly constrained with Send + 'static bounds, or could lifetime issues cause use-after-free vulnerabilities when the task is spawned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Async cancellation] If the returned futures are dropped before completion, are async cleanup operations (Drop implementations) properly executed, or could this leak resources or leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Task abort] Can tokio::spawn task aborts cause partial state updates where some operations complete but others don't, leading to inconsistent mint account state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/faucet.rs] [Function: start_faucet()] [Arc/Mutex patterns] Although not visible in this file, do the underlying RunConfig and faucet implementations use Arc/Mutex correctly to prevent data races in concurrent mint operations? (Medium)"
