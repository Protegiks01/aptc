  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Audit logging bypass] When import_private_key() is called, is it properly logged for security auditing, or can attackers import malicious keys without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Public key derivation] Does get_public_key() derive the public key from the stored private key each time, or could cached public keys become stale after key rotation, causing signature verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Timestamp manipulation] Can the last_update timestamp in PublicKeyResponse be manipulated to cause validators to use outdated keys, breaking consensus synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Private key exposure risk] By repeatedly calling get_public_key() and measuring timing, can an attacker perform side-channel attacks to recover bits of the private key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Error state information leak] If get() fails in get_public_key(), does the error reveal whether the key exists but is corrupted versus not existing at all? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key_previous_version()] [Previous version enumeration] Can attackers repeatedly call get_public_key_previous_version() to enumerate all historical public keys, aiding in cryptanalysis or validator identification attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key_previous_version()] [Missing previous version handling] If no previous version exists (first key), does the KeyVersionNotFound error properly distinguish this from other error cases, preventing confusion in key rotation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: get_public_key_previous_version()] [TOCTOU in version chain] Between get_public_key_previous_version() and subsequent operations, can rotate_key() be called, making the returned previous version no longer be the previous version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Rotation atomicity failure] If rotate_key() fails between setting previous_version and setting the new key, can this leave storage in an inconsistent state where both versions are invalid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Previous version overwrite] Does rotate_key() check if a previous_version already exists before overwriting it, or can repeated rotations lose key history needed for signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Concurrent rotation race] Can multiple concurrent rotate_key() calls for the same name cause key history corruption where previous_version doesn't match the actual previous current key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Old key retention] After rotate_key(), is the old current key properly moved to previous_version, or can it be lost, breaking verification of signatures made with the old key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Rollback attack] Can an attacker force a rollback to a previous key version after rotate_key(), potentially reusing a compromised old key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [New key generation failure] If new_ed25519_key_pair() fails or generates a weak key during rotate_key(), is the rotation aborted safely without losing the current valid key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Transaction not atomic] Since rotate_key() makes two separate set() calls, if the first succeeds and second fails, is the state rolled back, or is the validator left with inconsistent key storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Previous version chain breaking] After multiple rotations, can the previous_version chain become corrupted such that export_private_key_for_version() cannot find legitimate old keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Rotation frequency abuse] Can an attacker trigger excessive rotate_key() calls to overflow storage with previous_version entries or cause performance degradation in key lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/crypto_kv_storage.rs] [Function: sign()] [Key retrieval race] Between export_private_key() and private_key.sign() in sign(), can the key be rotated or deleted, causing signature generation with an unintended key version? (High)",
