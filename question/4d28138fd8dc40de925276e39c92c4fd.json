(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_gas_schedule()] [Response Size Limit] Does the reqwest call impose size limits on the HTTP response to prevent an attacker from serving an extremely large JSON payload that exhausts memory during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_gas_schedule()] [Timeout Handling] Can an attacker cause the fetch_gas_schedule() async function to hang indefinitely by hosting a slow-responding server, leading to denial of service in proposal generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_gas_schedule()] [Redirect Chain Exploitation] Can an attacker exploit HTTP redirect chains to bypass URL validation or cause excessive redirects that lead to resource exhaustion when fetching remote gas schedules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: fetch_gas_schedule()] [Content-Type Validation] Does fetch_gas_schedule() validate the Content-Type header of the HTTP response to ensure it's application/json, or can an attacker serve non-JSON content that causes parsing errors or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Struct: GasScheduleLocator] [Serialization Confusion] In the custom Serialize/Deserialize implementation, can an attacker craft ambiguous strings that could be interpreted as both local files and remote URLs, leading to unexpected file access patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: GasScheduleLocator::deserialize()] [URL Parsing Bypass] Does the Url::parse() check properly validate all URL components (scheme, host, port), or can an attacker craft malicious URLs with empty hosts or invalid schemes that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft two different Move scripts that produce the same execution hash, allowing them to substitute a malicious script after a proposal is approved but before execution?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Temporary File Race Condition] Does the use of TempPath in get_execution_hash() create a race condition window where an attacker could modify the temporary file between creation and hash calculation, altering the execution hash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/mod.rs] [Function: get_execution_hash()] [Unwrap Panic] The function uses .unwrap() multiple times without error handling - can an attacker craft inputs that cause these unwraps to panic, leading to denial of service in proposal generation?
