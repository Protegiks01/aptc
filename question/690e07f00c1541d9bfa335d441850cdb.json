  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: OptionType] [Option interpretation ambiguity] Is there consistent interpretation of empty vec as None and len=1 vec as Some across all code consuming old_values? Can inconsistent interpretation cause state desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: old_values] [Invalid None representation] For property mutations that should have old values (updating existing properties), can an attacker provide empty OptionType vecs to falsely claim no previous value existed, bypassing validation or audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: OptionType] [Memory overhead exploitation] Can an attacker craft events with large OptionType vecs (e.g., 1000 PropertyValues in a single 'option') to waste memory and gas, even though semantically only 0-1 values should exist? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: creator] [Creator spoofing] Does the event emission validate that the transaction sender matches the `creator` field, or can an attacker emit events claiming to be a different creator, falsifying token mutation history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: creator] [Zero address attack] Is there validation preventing creator from being 0x0 or other reserved addresses that could cause issues with ownership validation or event indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: creator] [Creator address validation] Can the creator field reference non-existent accounts or accounts that have been deleted, causing issues with event attribution or enabling false mutation claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Authorization bypass] Since this is just an event type, is there enforcement elsewhere that only authorized accounts can mutate specific token properties? Can anyone emit mutation events for tokens they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Event replay] Does the event include sequence numbers, timestamps, or transaction versions to prevent replay? Can old events be re-emitted to falsify mutation history or confuse indexers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Event ordering] Without timestamps or sequence numbers, can events for the same token be reordered by malicious nodes, causing indexers to show incorrect mutation history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Concurrent mutations] Can multiple transactions mutate the same token properties simultaneously, and without proper event ordering, cause race conditions where the final state doesn't match the event sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: old_values] [Stale old_values] If an event is replayed or delayed, can outdated old_values in the event cause audit or validation logic to incorrectly accept invalid mutations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: old_values vs new_values] [Value transition validation] Is there validation that new_values actually differ from old_values, or can no-op mutations (old == new) be emitted wastefully, consuming gas and storage unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: old_values] [Old value verification] Does anyone verify that the old_values in the event actually match the on-chain state before the mutation? Can attackers emit events with false old_values to hide their mutation tracks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Atomic mutation guarantee] For mutations involving multiple properties (multiple keys), is the entire mutation atomic? Can partial failures leave some properties updated while others aren't, causing the event to misrepresent the actual state change? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: new_values] [Post-mutation validation] After emitting the event, is there verification that the new on-chain property values match new_values in the event? Can events lie about the mutation result? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Cross-property dependencies] If certain property mutations have interdependencies (e.g., changing 'price' should also update 'last_price_change' timestamp), can attackers emit events violating these invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Fields: creator + collection + token] [Identity collision] Is the tuple (creator, collection, token) guaranteed unique? Can attackers create events for non-existent tokens or collide with existing tokens through hash/truncation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: collection] [Collection existence check] Does event emission validate that the referenced collection actually exists on-chain, or can events be emitted for non-existent collections causing indexer confusion?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Field: token] [Token name canonicalization] Are token names canonicalized (normalized, case-folded)? Can attackers use variations of token names to create events for wrong tokens or bypass restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/default_property_mutate.rs] [Struct: DefaultPropertyMutate] [Event size limit] Is there a maximum size limit on the entire serialized event?
