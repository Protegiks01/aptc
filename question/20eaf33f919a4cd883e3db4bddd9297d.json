  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Timestamp Overflow] If block_timestamp approaches u64::MAX, can additions in expiration calculations overflow, causing batches to never expire? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Filter Bypass] In handle_proposal_request() lines 106-112, the excluded_batches HashSet is extracted from PayloadFilter - can a malicious filter omit batches that should be excluded, causing double-inclusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Filter Manipulation] Can excluded_batches HashSet be manipulated to include batches that haven't been proposed yet, preventing legitimate batches from ever being included? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Filter Overflow] If excluded_batches contains millions of entries, can the HashSet operations cause memory exhaustion or performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Author Exclusion] Lines 141-142 use exclude_authors from optqs params - can excluding all validators cause empty blocks and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Deduplication Failure] Lines 169-174 chain excluded_batches with proof_block and opt_batches - if the same BatchInfoExt appears in multiple categories due to a clone/reference bug, can it be included multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Batch Priority] Does pull_proofs() and pull_batches() use a fair selection algorithm, or can a Byzantine validator game the system to always have their batches selected first? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Batch Expiration] Are batch expiration times validated before insertion, or can batches with expiration=u64::MAX accumulate indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Payload Type Mismatch] Lines 205-235 construct different Payload types - if validators have inconsistent enable_payload_v2 settings, will they reject each other's proposals causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Payload Serialization] When constructing OptQuorumStorePayload, QuorumStoreInlineHybridV2, or QuorumStoreInlineHybrid, are there size limits enforced to prevent excessively large proposals? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [ProofWithData Construction] Line 225 and 231 create ProofWithData::new(proof_block) - does this validate that proofs match their claimed batches? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Inline Batch Data Integrity] Line 206 converts inline_block to InlineBatches - are the transaction summaries verified to match the actual transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Memory Leak] If receive_proofs() is called faster than handle_commit_notification() cleans up, can batch_proof_queue grow unbounded? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Memory Exhaustion] Lines 189-203 perform multiple clones of potentially large data structures - can this cause excessive memory allocation under high load? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [CPU Exhaustion] If pull_proofs() or pull_batches() scan large queues with millions of entries, can this cause excessive CPU usage and consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Metric Overflow] Lines 124-127, 185-186 observe metrics - can metric values overflow if counters exceed f64 precision? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Metric Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate NUM_BATCHES_WITHOUT_PROOF_OF_STORE or PROOF_QUEUE_FULLY_UTILIZED metrics to mislead monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Silent Failure] Lines 238-241 only debug log if callback.send() fails - are proposal requests silently dropped if the receiver is unavailable? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Panic Propagation] If batch_proof_queue.pull_proofs() or other methods panic, will this crash the entire ProofManager task? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Error Recovery] If receive_proofs() encounters an invalid proof, does it reject just that proof or the entire batch? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Async Cancellation] If the start() task is cancelled while processing handle_proposal_request(), can this leave partial state updates? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Back Pressure Race] Lines 285-291 and 319-325 check if back_pressure changed before sending - can rapid back pressure fluctuations cause update messages to be dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Config Validation] Does new() validate that back_pressure_total_txn_limit and back_pressure_total_proof_limit are reasonable values, or can they be set to 1 causing immediate back pressure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/proof_manager.rs] [Batch Expiry Gap] Line 48 passes batch_expiry_gap_when_init_usecs to BatchProofQueue - can this be set to 0 causing all batches to be immediately expired? (Medium)"
