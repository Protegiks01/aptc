  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Error messages] If standardization panics (e.g., due to slice index out of bounds), do error messages leak sensitive information about indexer internals or transaction data that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Timing attacks] Can an attacker measure execution time differences between special and non-special address processing to infer private information about which addresses are being actively indexed or filtered? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Memory residue] After standardization, are temporary String objects properly cleared from memory? Can residual address data in memory be read by other processes or survive crashes, leaking filtered address information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Filter timing] Is standardization performed before or after applying transaction filters? If after, can malicious transactions bypass filters using non-standard address formats? If before, can standardization overhead slow down filtering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Filter rule matching] If filter rules are written using one address format (e.g., short '0x1') but incoming transactions use another (e.g., long '0x00...01'), does standardization happen at the right layer to ensure rules match correctly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Partial standardization] If an attacker submits a transaction with multiple addresses (sender, receiver, etc.), and only some addresses get standardized due to errors, can this create inconsistent filtering where the transaction is partially accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Filter bypass via case sensitivity] If filter rules are case-sensitive but standardization is case-insensitive (or vice versa), can attackers bypass filters using mixed-case addresses like '0xAbCd'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Whitelist/blacklist collision] If both whitelist and blacklist filters use standardized addresses, can an attacker exploit edge cases where an address standardizes to match both lists, causing undefined filtering behavior? (Medium)"
