  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: Message, line 59] [Vec Growth] The data Vec can grow arbitrarily - are there protections against integer overflow in Vec capacity calculations with malicious large inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 122] [Handler Registration] The OutboundHandler stores receivers - is there proper cleanup when channels are closed, or can this leak memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_inbound_channel, line 129] [Channel Flood] Can an attacker send messages faster than handlers can process them, causing unbounded queue growth in the crossbeam channel? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 120] [Outbound Flood] Can flooding the outbound channel cause the sender to block indefinitely if the receiver can't keep up, creating a DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, lines 87-88] [Runtime Thread Exhaustion] Can spawning excessive async tasks on the two runtimes exhaust system thread pools and prevent other critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: start, line 149] [Handler Lifecycle] If handlers are registered after start() is called, will they be properly initialized, or can this cause messages to be dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: shutdown, line 156] [Partial Shutdown] If only inbound or outbound shutdown succeeds, does this leave the NetworkController in a partially-shutdown state with undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkMessage, line 25] [Field Visibility] All fields are public - can external code modify sender addresses or message_type to bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: Message, line 59] [Public Data Field] The data field is public - can external code replace message contents after validation but before sending? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: MessageType, line 32] [Public Field Access] The message_type field is public but there's a getter method - is there inconsistent access that could bypass validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Lines 73-82] [GRPC Runtime Isolation] The comment mentions GRPC requires separate runtimes - if this isolation breaks, what's the failure mode and security impact? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, line 96] [GRPC Server Binding] When InboundHandler starts its GRPC server, can it fail to bind to the listen_addr (e.g., port already in use), and how is this error handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, line 97] [Service String Usage] The service string is cloned and passed to handlers - can mismatched service names between peers cause message routing failures or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: new, lines 95-113] [Initialization Order] If handlers are registered before start() is called, is there a window where messages can be sent before the server is ready to receive? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 123] [Handler Registration] Does OutboundHandler.register_handler validate that the message_type isn't already registered for a different peer address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_inbound_channel, line 134] [Handler Registration] Does InboundHandler.register_handler prevent duplicate registration that could cause message loss or handler confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Struct: NetworkController, line 86] [OutboundHandler Reference] OutboundHandler holds a reference to InboundHandler - can this circular dependency cause issues in shutdown order or memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/mod.rs] [Function: create_outbound_channel, line 122] [Handler Storage] OutboundHandler stores receivers in a Vec - is there a maximum size to prevent unbounded growth from handler registration? (Medium)",
