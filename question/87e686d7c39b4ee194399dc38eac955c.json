  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [State corruption] Can namespace collisions with the 'state_merkle_db' constant cause Merkle tree nodes to be mixed with other data types, corrupting the Jellyfish Merkle Tree structure and invalidating all state proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Path traversal] When the 'state_merkle_db' string is concatenated with base paths, are there proper validations to prevent attackers from using '../' or absolute paths to redirect state storage to unauthorized locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Shard confusion] In sharded mode where 16 state_merkle_db_shard_N databases exist alongside the metadata DB, can the base STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME constant cause confusion that leads to writing shard data to the non-sharded database or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Duplicate definition] Since STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME is also defined in state_merkle_db.rs at line 50, can discrepancies between these definitions cause different parts of the codebase to reference different Merkle databases, breaking state integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Symbolic link attack] During database initialization, can symlink attacks redirect 'state_merkle_db' to a malicious database containing a forged Merkle tree that validates incorrect state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Backup vulnerability] When creating or restoring from snapshots, can the 'state_merkle_db' name be exploited to replace the legitimate Merkle tree with a malicious one during the restore process, allowing validators to accept invalid state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Access control] Are filesystem permissions properly enforced on the 'state_merkle_db' directory, or can local attackers read Merkle tree structure to deduce sensitive account state information or write malicious nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constant: STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME] [Migration attack] During database migrations or version upgrades, can the hardcoded database name cause old and new database versions to conflict, corrupting the Merkle tree during the transition period? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constants: All] [Const mutation] Are these pub const values properly immutable in all contexts, or can unsafe Rust code or FFI boundaries modify these 'constants' at runtime, causing undefined behavior in database operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constants: All] [Initialization order] If these constants are referenced during static initialization, can race conditions or initialization ordering issues cause them to be used before proper initialization, leading to null pointers or invalid database paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Constants: All] [Test environment] Do test environments properly override or isolate these constants, or can test code accidentally read/write production databases due to hardcoded paths, causing data corruption or information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [Module visibility] [Access control] The constants are marked as `pub` and `pub(crate)` - is the visibility correctly scoped, or does the public visibility of LEDGER_DB_NAME and STATE_MERKLE_DB_NAME allow external crates to misuse these constants for unauthorized database access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/common.rs] [TODO comment] [Technical debt] The TODO comment mentions needing an 'iteration API' or 'recent enough waypoint' - does this unimplemented functionality represent a security gap where old clients cannot safely synchronize beyond 100 epochs, creating a potential for network splits? (High)"
