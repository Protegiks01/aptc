  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: code()] [Code collision] Can an attacker exploit the sequential error code assignment to predict or manipulate error responses, potentially fingerprinting node versions or inferring internal state based on which error codes are returned? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: code()] [Missing variant handling] If a new ApiError variant is added to the enum but not added to the code() match statement, will the code fail to compile or will it cause undefined behavior that could lead to incorrect error reporting and mask critical security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: code()] [Code reassignment] If error codes are changed or reassigned during protocol upgrades, can this cause breaking changes in Rosetta clients that depend on specific error codes, potentially leading to mishandled transaction errors and fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: code()] [Integer overflow] Although error codes are u32, can the sequential assignment pattern cause issues if more than 2^32 error types are added over time, or is there validation to prevent code collisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: all()] [Missing error variant] The RejectedByFilter error variant exists in the ApiError enum but is missing from the all() function - can this cause the Rosetta spec compliance check to fail, potentially preventing proper error handling for filtered transactions and causing transaction submission failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: all()] [Incomplete error enumeration] Does the Rosetta specification require ALL possible errors to be listed in the network/options endpoint, and can the missing RejectedByFilter variant cause compliance violations that break Rosetta client integrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: all()] [Maintenance burden] When new error variants are added to ApiError, if developers forget to add them to all(), can this create a silent failure where certain errors are never properly reported to Rosetta clients, potentially hiding critical transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: all()] [Option handling] All errors in all() use None for optional fields - can this cause information loss where detailed error context needed for debugging transaction failures is stripped out, making it impossible to diagnose why transactions are rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [Infinite retry loops] Can an attacker exploit the retriable flag for AccountNotFound errors to create infinite retry loops by preventing account creation, causing Rosetta clients to endlessly retry transactions and exhaust resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [DoS amplification] The comment states 'there is a possibility that some of these could be retriable forever (e.g. an account is never created)' - can this be weaponized by an attacker to DoS Rosetta services by causing perpetual retries on non-existent accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [MempoolIsFull exploitation] Is marking MempoolIsFull as retriable safe, or can an attacker fill the mempool and force legitimate transactions into infinite retry loops, effectively blocking transaction submission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [GasEstimationFailed loops] Can GasEstimationFailed being marked retriable cause issues where repeatedly failing gas estimations (due to contract bugs or attacks) lead to infinite retries that waste computational resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [CoinTypeFailedToBeFetched race] If CoinTypeFailedToBeFetched is retriable but the coin type genuinely doesn't exist or is malformed, can this cause infinite retry loops that prevent transaction processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [BlockNotFound timing] BlockNotFound is marked retriable assuming blocks will eventually appear, but can an attacker exploit chain reorganizations or network partitions to keep blocks permanently unavailable, causing infinite retries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: retriable()] [Incorrect non-retriable marking] Are there errors currently marked as non-retriable that should be retriable (like temporary network issues), causing legitimate transactions to fail permanently instead of being retried? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: details()] [Missing variant handling] StateValueNotFound and RejectedByFilter variants exist in the enum but are not handled in the details() match statement - can this cause these errors to incorrectly return None for details, hiding critical information about why transactions were rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: details()] [Information disclosure] The details() function returns inner error messages that may contain sensitive information from the REST API - can these leaked details expose internal node state, account balances, or other confidential information to attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: details()] [Stack trace leakage] Do the error details ever include stack traces or internal file paths that could help attackers map the internal codebase and identify vulnerable code paths for targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: details()] [Resource enumeration] Can error details be used to enumerate existing accounts, resources, or modules by observing different error messages for existing vs non-existing entities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: details()] [Timing attack] Do different error details take different amounts of time to process, potentially allowing timing attacks to infer information about the blockchain state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: message()] [Typo in production] Line 191 contains a typo 'Faileed' instead of 'Failed' in CoinTypeFailedToBeFetched message - while minor, can this unprofessional error message reduce trust in the platform and indicate poor code quality that might extend to security-critical areas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: message()] [Information disclosure] The message 'This API is unavailable for the node because he's offline' reveals node operational status - can attackers use this to identify which nodes are offline and target them for attacks when they come back online? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: message()] [Static message limitations] All messages are static strings - can this limitation prevent proper error reporting for complex scenarios where dynamic information is needed to diagnose transaction failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: message()] [Insufficient context] Some error messages like 'Invalid operations' are too generic - can this prevent Rosetta clients from properly handling errors and cause incorrect transaction resubmission behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: status_code()] [Incorrect status codes] All errors return HTTP 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR regardless of whether they're client errors (4xx) or server errors (5xx) - can this violate HTTP semantics and break Rosetta clients that expect proper status code handling? (Medium)"
