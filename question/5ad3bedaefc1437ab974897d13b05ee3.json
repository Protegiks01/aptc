  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Error: constraint violation] [Data corruption] If a UNIQUE constraint violation occurs on processor name, can this corrupt the indexer's view of which transactions have been processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Error: transaction abort] [Partial commit] If a database transaction aborts after updating processor_status but before committing other indexed data, can this cause state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integrity: version consistency] [Gap detection] Is there a mechanism to detect gaps in processed versions, or can missing transactions go unnoticed if last_success_version jumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integrity: cross-processor] [Dependency validation] If one processor depends on another (e.g., NFT processor depends on coin processor), are version dependencies validated to prevent inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integrity: timestamp validation] [Clock skew] Can clock skew between database server and indexer cause last_updated timestamps to be inaccurate, breaking monitoring and alerting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integrity: version bounds] [Blockchain sync] Is last_success_version validated against the actual blockchain height to prevent indexing non-existent or future versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Schema: table definition] [Missing index] Is the processor column properly indexed as primary key for fast lookups, or can missing indexes cause O(n) query performance? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Access: database permissions] [Privilege escalation] Are database user permissions properly restricted to prevent unauthorized modification of processor_status by non-indexer processes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Access: processor isolation] [Cross-contamination] Can one processor read or modify another processor's status, potentially causing cascading failures across the indexing system? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integration: update_last_processed_version] [Atomic commit] When tailer.rs updates processor status, is the update atomic with the actual indexed data commit, or can crashes cause divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integration: get_start_version] [Bootstrap] During indexer bootstrap, if get_start_version returns None, can incorrect initial version assumptions cause reprocessing of the entire blockchain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integration: health monitoring] [False positives] Can stale processor_status records cause health checks to incorrectly report processors as healthy when they're actually stuck? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Integration: version calculation] [Off-by-one] When adding 1 to last_success_version in get_start_version(), can this cause duplicate processing of the last successful version? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Performance: query frequency] [Database load] If processor status is queried on every transaction batch, can this create excessive database load affecting indexer throughput? (Low)",
