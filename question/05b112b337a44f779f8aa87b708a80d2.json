  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: StorageOpt] [Indexer GRPC blocking] enable_indexer_grpc at line 123 and wait_for_indexer_grpc in pipeline config at line 193 - can indexer slowness or failures cause the entire benchmark to hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: PipelineOpt] [Split stages resource usage] split_stages at line 148 causes each stage to wait for the previous - can this cause all blocks to accumulate in memory between stages, causing OOM for large block counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Struct: PipelineOpt] [Abort/discard/retry interaction] When allow_aborts, allow_discards, and allow_retries are all false (default), any transaction failure causes the benchmark to abort - can this be too strict and hide real-world failure handling issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: Opt::execution_threads()] [CPU detection failure] If num_cpus::get() returns 0 or fails, execution_threads() could return 0 - can this cause division by zero or thread pool creation failures downstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Execution threads zero] If execution_threads is explicitly set to 0 via command-line, the assertion at line 612 wouldn't catch it if num_executor_shards is also 0 - can this cause zero-thread execution attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Remote address TOCTOU] remote_executor_addresses is accessed multiple times at lines 627-632 and 636 - can time-of-check-time-of-use race conditions occur if this is modified by concurrent code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Global state race] Multiple set_X_once() calls at lines 657-661 - if multiple benchmark instances run concurrently (e.g., in a test harness), can these global settings conflict, causing unpredictable behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Profiler state leak] Profiler handlers at lines 669-670 are created but might not be properly dropped if the benchmark panics - can this cause profiling state to leak across multiple benchmark runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [CPU profiling overhead] When cpu_profiling is enabled at line 672, does the profiling overhead significantly affect benchmark results, making them non-comparable to non-profiled runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory profiling path] memory_profiler.end_profiling() at line 715 uses a hardcoded relative path - can this fail if the benchmark is run from a different working directory, losing profiling data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Executor type safety] The match at lines 679-709 dispatches to different executor types - can unsafe code in any of these executor implementations cause undefined behavior that bypasses Rust's safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [PtxExecutor platform dependency] PtxExecutor at lines 702-708 is Linux-specific but has no compile-time guard preventing selection on other platforms - can this cause runtime failures or undefined behavior on non-Linux systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Generic executor assumptions] The generic E: VMBlockExecutor at line 483 - can implementations that don't properly implement all required traits cause compile-time errors that are confusing or runtime panics? (Low)"
