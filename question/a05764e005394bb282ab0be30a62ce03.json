  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Gas metering bypass] Can an attacker exploit the zero gas parameters (NativeGasParameters::zeros() and MiscGasParameters::zeros()) used in genesis to execute unbounded computations during genesis initialization, potentially causing denial of service or resource exhaustion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Feature flag manipulation] Does the use of TimedFeaturesBuilder::enable_all() create a security vulnerability where features intended to be disabled are enabled during genesis, potentially allowing unauthorized protocol behaviors or bypassing safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Configuration bypass] Can the LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION constant be manipulated at compile time or through feature flags to enable untested gas charging logic during genesis, leading to consensus inconsistencies across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [State inconsistency] Since Features::default() is used, can an attacker exploit differences between default features and on-chain features to create divergent genesis states across different nodes, causing chain splits?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Type confusion] Does the aptos_default_ty_builder() call properly validate type layouts, or can malicious genesis transactions inject invalid type layouts leading to memory corruption during genesis execution?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Resource exhaustion] Since native gas parameters are set to zeros, can genesis transactions execute expensive native operations (cryptography, storage) without limits, causing validators to run out of memory or CPU?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Chain ID bypass] Is the chain_id parameter properly validated, or can genesis be run with an incorrect/malicious chain_id that causes incompatibility with the rest of the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Clone semantics] Does RuntimeEnvironment::new_with_config properly initialize all internal state, or can cloning this environment later (line 63) lead to shared mutable state and race conditions?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Timed features bypass] Since TimedFeaturesBuilder::enable_all() ignores time-based activation, can this lead to premature feature activation that breaks protocol invariants or consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Memory leak] Does the native_builder with zero gas parameters properly handle resource cleanup, or can repeated genesis attempts leak memory through untracked native context allocations?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: GenesisRuntimeBuilder::new()] [Integer overflow] Can the combination of LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION and zero gas parameters cause integer overflow in gas calculations, potentially wrapping to negative values and bypassing gas limits? (Medium)",
