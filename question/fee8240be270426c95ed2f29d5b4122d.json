(High)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-manager/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal handling] Does the tokio runtime properly handle SIGTERM/SIGINT for graceful shutdown, or can signal-based attacks cause abrupt termination leaving data in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
