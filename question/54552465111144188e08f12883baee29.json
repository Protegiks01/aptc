  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: Peer] [Unused type security] Lines 62-68 define an unused Peer struct - if this is later activated, can peer_id field be spoofed to impersonate validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Struct: SyncStatus] [Unused but dangerous] Lines 70-82 define unused sync status - if activated without proper validation, can attackers manipulate synced boolean to claim unsynced nodes are synced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Memory safety] [No unsafe blocks visible] The file doesn't contain visible unsafe blocks, but do any called functions contain unsafe code that could cause memory corruption with malformed inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: parse_requested_balance()] [Iterator safety] Lines 456-463 use .iter().map().sum() - can extremely large arrays cause stack overflow or excessive memory allocation during iteration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: get_stake_balances()] [Pending inactive commission] Lines 354-356 return pending_inactive without commission check - should commission have already been extracted, and can this cause incorrect balance reporting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: get_stake_balances()] [Total stake calculation consistency] Line 360 calculates total stake by subtracting commission from get_total_staked_amount() - does this match the sum of individual components, or can rounding differences cause inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Function: get_stake_balances()] [Rewards without commission] Lines 363-364 return accumulated_rewards - should commission be deducted from rewards, or do rewards get commission-free reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/misc.rs] [Overall architecture] [Trust model violation] The file trusts view function responses without cryptographic verification - can malicious Rosetta API servers return fake balances that cause exchanges to credit funds that don't exist on-chain? (Critical)"
