  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Race condition on start] Since executor_service.start() is called immediately in new() at line 31, can race conditions occur if the service receives execution requests before full initialization is complete? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Race condition on shutdown] Can concurrent calls to shutdown() from multiple threads cause race conditions in the underlying ExecutorService cleanup, leading to panics or incomplete resource cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Shared mutable state] Does the executor_service field allow safe concurrent access, or can multiple threads accessing the same ThreadExecutorService instance cause data races or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization ordering] Is there a guaranteed happens-before relationship between executor_service.start() and the service being ready to process requests, or can early requests be lost or mishandled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Graceful shutdown timeout] Does shutdown() wait for in-flight execution requests to complete, or can it abruptly terminate processing and leave transactions in inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Unused field] The _self_address field at line 10 is prefixed with underscore indicating it's unused - does keeping this allocated SocketAddr in memory serve any purpose, or is it dead code that could be removed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Clone cost] At line 29, remote_shard_addresses is passed by value (moved), but tests show it's cloned before passing - can excessive cloning of large address vectors cause performance issues or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Mutable borrow] Does shutdown() require &mut self at line 38, preventing concurrent access during shutdown, or can this lead to deadlocks if multiple code paths try to shutdown simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Struct: ThreadExecutorService] [Move semantics] Can ThreadExecutorService be moved between threads safely, or does the wrapped ExecutorService contain thread-local state that would be corrupted by moving? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic on invalid input] If any parameter validation fails in the ExecutorService constructor, does it panic without recovery, crashing the validator node instead of returning a Result? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network binding failure] If the underlying NetworkController fails to bind to the specified socket address, does it panic or return an error that could be handled gracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Shutdown panic] Can shutdown() panic if called on a service that's already shut down or never started, causing validator crashes during recovery procedures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Unwrap/expect propagation] Does the code use unwrap() or expect() calls that could panic on unexpected conditions, violating Rust best practices for error handling in production code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Unauthenticated shard communication] Does ThreadExecutorService establish authenticated channels with remote_shard_addresses, or can a malicious node impersonate a shard and inject false execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Cross-shard message tampering] Are messages between shards cryptographically signed and verified, or can a man-in-the-middle attacker modify execution results during cross-shard communication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard identity verification] Does the service verify that incoming requests actually come from the claimed shard_id, or can one shard impersonate another to bypass execution isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network encryption] Are connections to coordinator_address and remote_shard_addresses encrypted with TLS, or are execution requests and results transmitted in plaintext over the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Non-deterministic initialization] Could differences in thread scheduling or network timing during new() cause different validators to initialize their ThreadExecutorService with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration divergence] If different validators call new() with slightly different parameters (num_threads, addresses), can this cause execution results to diverge and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [State cleanup inconsistency] Can shutdown timing differences across validators cause some to retain cached state while others clear it, leading to inconsistent execution results in subsequent epochs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Executor service coupling] Does ThreadExecutorService make assumptions about ExecutorService's internal state that could be violated if ExecutorService implementation changes, causing security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Start timing assumptions] By calling executor_service.start() immediately at line 31, does this assume network readiness before the NetworkController is fully initialized, potentially losing early messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Shutdown ordering] Does shutdown() call controller.shutdown() before stopping the executor service thread, and could wrong ordering leave the service in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Unbounded execution threads] Can an attacker craft transactions that cause each shard to spawn num_threads worker threads, multiplying across num_shards to exhaust system thread pool limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/thread_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory consumption per shard] Does each ThreadExecutorService instance consume a fixed amount of memory, and can creating many shards cause out-of-memory conditions on validator nodes? (Medium)"
