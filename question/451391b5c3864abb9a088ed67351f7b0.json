  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker provide malicious bucket names that bypass cloud storage authentication, allowing unauthorized access to buckets containing sensitive indexer data or enabling bucket enumeration attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker craft bucket names with path traversal sequences (../, absolute paths, or special characters) to access files outside the intended bucket scope, potentially reading sensitive configuration or credential files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the Client::new() call at line 120 implement proper connection pooling and timeout limits, or can an attacker trigger unlimited connection attempts leading to resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Chain ID mismatch] At lines 135-140, if an attacker compromises the metadata.json file in either bucket and changes the chain_id, can they cause the checker to fail initialization, leading to undetected data corruption or loss of monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Progress file manipulation] At lines 142-149, if the progress file doesn't exist, it falls back to starting_version - can an attacker delete the progress file repeatedly to force the checker to restart from an old version, missing recently corrupted files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Chain ID validation bypass] At lines 151-156, the chain_id validation between metadata and progress file only checks equality - can an attacker exploit integer overflow or type confusion to bypass this check with crafted chain_id values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Struct: Processor] [Input validation] The existing_bucket_name and new_bucket_name fields at lines 29-31 have no validation - can an attacker provide empty strings, extremely long strings, or injection payloads that cause cloud storage API failures or command injection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Struct: Processor] [Integer overflow] The starting_version field at line 33 is u64 - can it overflow when combined with the hardcoded +1000 increment at line 94, causing version wraparound and skipping file checks? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_raw_file()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Between downloading a file at line 171 and comparing it later, can an attacker race to modify the cloud storage object, causing inconsistent verification results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_raw_file()] [Resource exhaustion] The download at line 171 has no size limit - can an attacker upload extremely large files (GBs or TBs) to exhaust memory when the entire file is loaded into Vec<u8>? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_file()] [Deserialization attack] At line 195, serde_json::from_slice is called on untrusted cloud storage data - can an attacker upload malicious JSON with deeply nested structures, causing stack overflow or CPU exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [File comparison bypass] At line 79, files are compared with simple equality (existing_file != new_file) - can an attacker exploit compression artifacts, different compression levels, or metadata differences to make semantically identical files appear different? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Race condition] At lines 58-60, two separate download operations occur - can an attacker exploit the window between downloads to modify one file, causing false positives or false negatives in the comparison? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Memory exhaustion] At lines 77-78, both files are unwrapped and kept in memory simultaneously - for large transaction files, can this cause OOM crashes when comparing multi-GB files?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Timing side channel] The byte-by-byte comparison at line 79 may leak timing information about where files differ - can an attacker use this to infer transaction data or find corruption patterns?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [False negative] If both buckets are compromised and contain identical corrupted files, the comparison at line 79 would pass - is there any cryptographic verification to detect synchronized corruption?
