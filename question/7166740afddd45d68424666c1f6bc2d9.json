  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_signed_transfer_txn()] [Sequence Number Desync] If get_signed_transfer_txn() is called multiple times without submitting transactions, does the sequence number increment for each call, causing later transactions to have gaps that prevent execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_signed_transfer_txn()] [Sender Address] Can from_account.address() return incorrect or manipulated addresses that cause funds to be debited from wrong accounts or enable impersonation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_signed_transfer_txn()] [Signature Validity] Does sign_with_transaction_builder() produce cryptographically valid signatures for all input combinations, or are there edge cases where invalid signatures could be created? (Critical)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_signed_transfer_txn()] [Gas Validation Client-Side] Are max_gas_amount and gas_unit_price validated client-side before transaction submission, or can invalid values cause guaranteed transaction failure after incrementing sequence number? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Default Gas Amount] Is the default max_gas_amount of 5,000 sufficient for all transfer scenarios, or can complex coin types require more gas causing transactions to fail and waste fees? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Default Gas Price] Does the default gas_unit_price of 100 match current network conditions, or could it be too low causing transaction delays or too high wasting user funds? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Gas Price Manipulation] Can attackers provide maliciously high gas_unit_price values to drain user accounts through excessive fees even if transfers fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Gas Amount Zero] Does validation prevent gas_unit_price or max_gas_amount from being set to zero, which would cause guaranteed transaction rejection? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Gas Amount Overflow] Can max_gas_amount * gas_unit_price overflow u64 causing incorrect fee calculations or allowing attackers to execute transactions at lower cost than intended? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Timeout Too Short] If timeout_secs is set too low (e.g., 1 second), can network latency cause valid transactions to expire before inclusion, wasting gas and sequence numbers? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Timeout Zero] Does validation prevent timeout_secs from being zero, which would create transactions that expire immediately and always fail? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Timeout Overflow] Can extremely large timeout_secs values cause timestamp overflow when added to current time, creating transactions with invalid expiration? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Coin Type Validation] Is coin_type string validated before use in TypeTag parsing, or can empty strings, invalid formats, or malicious inputs cause parsing errors or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Coin Type Injection] Can coin_type contain special characters or escape sequences that break TypeTag parsing or enable injection attacks into the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Default Coin Type] Is the default coin_type '0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin' guaranteed to exist on all Aptos networks, or could it fail on testnets or custom deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Lifetime Annotation] Does the lifetime annotation 'a on coin_type create memory safety issues where the string could be deallocated while TransferOptions is still in use? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Option Mutation] Can TransferOptions values be mutated after creation but before transaction building, causing race conditions or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Struct: TransferOptions] [Unwrap Default] Does options.unwrap_or_default() safely handle None cases, or could default values be inappropriate for certain transfer scenarios causing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Stale Balance] Can get_account_balance() return stale data from the API client cache that doesn't reflect recent transfers, enabling double-spending or logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Balance Overflow] Does the returned u64 balance handle edge cases where internal API representations could overflow or represent balances incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Error Context] Does the error context 'Failed to get account balance' expose sensitive information about internal state or account existence that aids attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Account Existence] Can get_account_balance() be called on non-existent accounts, and does it properly distinguish between zero balance and account doesn't exist scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [Race Condition] If get_account_balance() is called concurrently with transfer() for the same account, can race conditions lead to incorrect balance readings that break application logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: get_account_balance()] [APT Only] Does view_apt_account_balance() only return AptosCoin balances, and is there no way to check balances of custom coin types through this interface causing limitations? (Low)",
  "[File: sdk/src/coin_client.rs] [Function: new()] [API Client Lifetime] Does the lifetime annotation 'a on CoinClient ensure API client outlives all CoinClient operations, or could dangling references cause use-after-free bugs? (High)"
