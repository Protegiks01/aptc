  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Infinite recursion] Can carefully crafted schema arguments trigger unbounded recursive macro expansion in the schema! macro, causing stack overflow during compilation or runtime evaluation and preventing validator builds or causing crashes?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Literal key exploitation] Can an attacker use the literal key variants (lines 195-234) to inject arbitrary strings as log keys, including control characters, escape sequences, or format specifiers that exploit log aggregation systems?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Debug format DoS] When using the ?$val debug format variants (lines 167-178, 209-220), can attackers provide types with expensive Debug implementations that cause extreme CPU usage during logging, degrading validator performance during consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Display format exploit] In the %$val display format variants (lines 181-192, 223-234), can malicious Display trait implementations execute arbitrary code, leak sensitive memory, or cause panics when logs are generated during consensus round processing?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Schema injection] Can the lone schema case (lines 237-247) be exploited to inject pre-constructed malicious schemas that bypass validation, allowing attackers to forge audit logs or manipulate security monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Array construction] In the base case (line 133), does the array construction &[ $($val),* ] properly handle large numbers of values, or can attackers cause stack overflow by providing thousands of key-value pairs in a single log statement? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: schema] [Format template bypass] Can attackers exploit the format args handling (lines 141-150) to inject format templates that are processed but whose structured data is lost, allowing them to hide key-value pairs from security monitoring? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: fmt_args] [Argument mismatch] Can mismatches between format placeholders in $template and provided $args cause undefined behavior, buffer overruns, or information leakage when consensus round data is logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: fmt_args] [Option confusion] Since fmt_args returns None (line 264) when no format string is present and Some(...) otherwise (lines 269, 272), can this dual-return type cause validators to mishandle log formatting and accidentally expose unformatted sensitive data?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Macro: fmt_args] [Recursive stripping bypass] Can attackers craft nested format arguments that bypass the recursive stripping logic (lines 276-339), causing structured logging key-value pairs to be accidentally rendered in the format string and leak validator state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Consensus timing leak] Can the timing of log operations, particularly when METADATA.enabled() is true (line 63), leak information about consensus round timings, validator voting patterns, or BLS signature aggregation progress to network observers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Log injection via transactions] Can malicious transaction payloads craft inputs that, when logged via these macros, inject fake log entries that appear to come from validator consensus code, deceiving audit systems and security monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Disk exhaustion] If validators log transaction data or block proposals using these macros without size limits, can attackers submit massive transactions or blocks that fill validator disk space, preventing consensus operation and causing loss of liveness?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Log correlation attack] Can attackers analyze patterns in logged module_path!() (line 59) and file/line information (line 60) across multiple validators to identify which validators are processing which transactions, enabling targeted DoS or network partition attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Async context loss] When logs are generated from async contexts spawned via spawn_named, is critical context like consensus round, epoch, or validator identity properly propagated, or can context loss cause logs to be misattributed and hide Byzantine behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/macros.rs] [Integration] [Log aggregation bypass] Can attackers exploit differences in how different validators format and emit logs via these macros to cause log aggregation systems to miss critical security events, allowing consensus attacks to go undetected?
