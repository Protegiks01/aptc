  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [RNG Trait Bounds] [Non-Cryptographic RNG] All functions require both rand_core::CryptoRng and rand::CryptoRng - can the double trait bound be circumvented by passing a struct that implements traits but uses weak randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [RNG Trait Bounds] [Rand Core Hell Workaround] Lines 9-21 describe 'rand_core_hell' version conflicts - does this workaround compromise RNG security by using incompatible rand versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [RNG Trait Bounds] [RNG State Seeding] Is there validation that the RNG is properly seeded with entropy before use, or could unseeded/zero-entropy RNGs generate predictable keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [RNG Trait Bounds] [RNG Fork Safety] If validators fork processes after RNG initialization, could duplicate RNG states generate identical keys across multiple validators? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Cross-Function] [Mixed Secure/Insecure Usage] If secure functions (random_g1_point) and insecure functions (insecure_random_g1_points) are mixed in the same protocol, could this create subtle vulnerabilities? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Cross-Function] [Uniform Bytes Alternative] Why use hash-to-curve for G1/G2 instead of random_scalar_from_uniform_bytes + scalar multiplication - could the choice introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Cross-Function] [Function Documentation] Are all functions adequately documented with security warnings, especially the insecure variants, or could developers misuse them thinking they're safe? (High)",
