(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/compiled_package.rs] [Function: decode_unit()] [Source Map Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a manipulated source map file that mismatches the actual bytecode, causing incorrect debugging information that could hide exploit traces or mislead security audits? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/compilation/compiled_package.rs] [Function: decode_unit()] [Path Traversal in Source Paths] Does the function validate that source_path constructed from path_to_file doesn't escape the Sources directory through directory traversal sequences like '../../../'?
