  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_kzg.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Evaluation point manipulation] The comment at line 18 mentions f(ω^i) for i > 0 - can an attacker manipulate which roots of unity correspond to which evaluation indices, causing validators to evaluate polynomials at wrong points? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_kzg.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Degree-basis mismatch] If the DKG protocol expects polynomials of degree d but lagr_g1 contains elements for degree d' ≠ d, can this mismatch be exploited to create commitments that appear valid but represent wrong-degree polynomials?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_kzg.rs] [Function: apply()] [Commitment malleability] Is the commitment binding and non-malleable, or can an attacker transform a valid commitment C to a different commitment C' that opens to a related polynomial? (High)",
