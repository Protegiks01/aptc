  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Staking contract verification] For stake.move contracts handling validator staking, does the pipeline verify economic invariants that prevent stake manipulation attacks, or are economic properties outside verification scope? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Token contract verification] For coin.move and fungible asset contracts, does the pipeline verify conservation of value invariants that prevent inflation/deflation bugs, or can balance manipulation exploits pass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Module-level] [Framework upgrade verification] When Aptos framework contracts are upgraded, does the pipeline verify upgrade safety (e.g., storage layout compatibility), or can unsafe upgrades that break existing contracts pass verification? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Concurrent pipeline creation] If multiple threads call default_pipeline_with_options() simultaneously with shared ProverOptions, can race conditions in option access cause non-deterministic pipeline construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Processor state isolation] Do processors maintain independent state, or can state leakage between processors in the pipeline cause one function's verification to affect another's results? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Global state mutation] Can any processor in the pipeline (lines 30-66) mutate global state that affects subsequent verifications, causing non-deterministic or order-dependent verification results? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Pipeline reuse safety] If the returned FunctionTargetPipeline is reused for multiple contract verifications, can state from one verification contaminate another, causing incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Box type safety] The vec of Box<dyn FunctionTargetProcessor> on line 30 - can type erasure hide processor type mismatches that cause incorrect verification behavior at runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Trait object safety] Are all implementations of FunctionTargetProcessor trait object-safe, or can certain processor implementations cause undefined behavior when boxed and stored in the pipeline? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Generic type instantiation] Does MonoAnalysisProcessor (line 56) properly handle all generic type instantiations in Move contracts, or can certain complex generic patterns cause the processor to fail or produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: experimental_pipeline()] [Type inference in experimental] Does the experimental pipeline handle generic type inference differently than the default pipeline, potentially causing type confusion in verified contracts?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Critical ordering undocumented] The comment on line 29 states order is important but doesn't explain why - can developers reorder processors during maintenance without understanding the security implications? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: default_pipeline_with_options()] [Processor dependency documentation] Are processor dependencies (which must run before which) documented anywhere, or is this implicit knowledge that could be lost during code maintenance? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Function: experimental_pipeline()] [Experimental status unclear] The comment 'Enter your pipeline here' on line 81 suggests this is a template - can production code accidentally use this experimental pipeline, bypassing security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/bytecode-pipeline/src/pipeline_factory.rs] [Module-level] [Copyright header confusion] The copyright mentions both Diem and Move contributors (lines 1-3) - does this indicate legacy code that may not have been updated for Aptos-specific security requirements?
