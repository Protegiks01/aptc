  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Does the hyper::Body::from() conversion at line 20 properly handle large configuration strings, or can excessively large NodeConfig debug output cause buffer overflows or memory corruption in HTTP response generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Type Confusion] Can changes to the NodeConfig struct definition cause the debug formatter at line 19 to serialize unexpected types that bypass secret redaction mechanisms or expose raw memory contents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [API Versioning] If the NodeConfig structure changes between versions, can exposing different configuration schemas allow attackers to fingerprint exact node versions and target version-specific vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Consensus Information Leak] Does the NodeConfig contain consensus safety rule parameters (voting thresholds, timeout durations, round numbers) that could allow attackers to predict validator behavior and craft consensus manipulation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Validator Identification] Can the exposed configuration uniquely identify validator nodes through hardware specs, storage paths, or performance settings, enabling targeted attacks on high-stake validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Epoch Information] Does exposing epoch-related configuration allow attackers to predict epoch transitions and time attacks to occur during vulnerable reconfiguration periods when consensus guarantees are weakest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Staking Information] Can the configuration reveal staking parameters, validator rewards settings, or economic incentive structures that attackers could exploit to manipulate validator behavior or identify profit-maximizing attack strategies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [CPU Exhaustion] If the NodeConfig contains deeply nested structures or large collections, can the debug formatting at line 19 consume excessive CPU time, blocking the HTTP handler thread and preventing legitimate inspection service requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Memory Allocation] Does the format operation at line 19 pre-allocate buffer size or incrementally grow, and can this be exploited to cause memory fragmentation or allocation failures under memory pressure during consensus operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Stack Overflow] Can extremely deep configuration nesting in NodeConfig cause stack overflow during recursive debug formatting at line 19, crashing the validator node and causing consensus liveness failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Path Traversal] Does the NodeConfig contain file paths (log directories, storage paths, key files) that when exposed could reveal filesystem structure information useful for subsequent path traversal or local file inclusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Command Injection] Can configuration fields containing shell commands, environment variables, or script paths be exposed and exploited if administrators copy-paste configuration output into scripts or deployment tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [SQL Injection] If NodeConfig contains database connection strings or SQL query parameters for metrics/monitoring systems, can exposing these enable SQL injection attacks against backend databases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Key Derivation Leak] Does the NodeConfig expose key derivation parameters (salt values, iteration counts, KDF algorithms) that could weaken cryptographic security if attackers obtain encrypted key material? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Randomness Exposure] Can the configuration reveal RNG seeds, entropy sources, or randomness parameters used for VRF-based leader election, allowing attackers to predict future block proposers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Certificate Information] Does exposing TLS certificate paths, certificate expiry dates, or CA information enable attackers to prepare targeted MITM attacks or identify nodes with expired/expiring certificates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Panic Handling] Can the debug formatter at line 19 panic on malformed or corrupted NodeConfig structures, crashing the inspection service handler and potentially affecting other inspection service endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Unicode Handling] Does the debug formatter properly handle non-ASCII configuration values (internationalized domain names, unicode paths), or can this cause encoding issues that leak information or cause parsing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Null Byte Injection] Can configuration strings containing null bytes be improperly handled during debug formatting at line 19, causing truncation that hides sensitive information or creates log injection vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Authentication Bypass] Is there any authentication mechanism before calling this function, or can any network peer accessing the inspection service port retrieve configuration data when expose_configuration is enabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Role-Based Access] Should different operators have different visibility levels into configuration (e.g., only security-relevant vs. full config), and does this single function fail to implement fine-grained access control? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Token Validation] If authentication tokens or API keys are used elsewhere in the inspection service, does this function validate them before exposing configuration, or can token-less requests succeed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/configuration.rs] [Function: handle_configuration_request()] [Initialization State] Can this function be called before NodeConfig is fully initialized, potentially exposing default/placeholder values that reveal internal implementation details or cause undefined behavior?
