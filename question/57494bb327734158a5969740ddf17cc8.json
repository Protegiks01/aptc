  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime()] [Input validation] Is the `my_addr` parameter validated to ensure it's a legitimate validator address, or can an attacker provide an arbitrary AccountAddress to impersonate other validators in the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime()] [Configuration tampering] Can a malicious validator provide a modified `safety_rules_config` that weakens cryptographic guarantees or disables safety checks, allowing double-signing or consensus violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime()] [Integer overflow] Can the `randomness_override_seq_num` parameter be set to u64::MAX causing integer overflow in subsequent epoch comparisons, leading to randomness generation bypass or DKG session confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime()] [Configuration manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the `rb_config` (ReliableBroadcastConfig) parameters to cause excessive retries, bandwidth exhaustion, or timeout-based DoS affecting DKG transcript aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime()] [Identity confusion] If `my_addr` doesn't match the address derived from `safety_rules_config`, can this cause key material mismatches leading to signature verification failures or Byzantine behavior detection evasion?

  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_dkg_runtime(), Line 38] [Buffer sizing attack] Is the 1_024 buffer size hardcoded appropriately for all network conditions, or can high-latency scenarios combined with malicious message amplification cause legitimate messages to be dropped from full channels?
