  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Default implementation safety] At lines 43-51, does the Default trait implementation properly initialize all fields to safe values, or could callers relying on Default::default() get insecure configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: CheckEndpointArgs] [Flatten injection] At lines 55-59, does the #[clap(flatten)] directive properly isolate NodeAddressArgs and HandshakeArgs namespaces, or can attackers provide conflicting flags that override address validation with handshake parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: CheckEndpointArgs] [Combined validation gap] Does CheckEndpointArgs validate the COMBINATION of node_address_args and handshake_args for consistency, or can attackers provide incompatible pairs (e.g., mainnet address with Validator network_id) that cause security violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: CheckEndpointArgs] [Serialization order dependency] During Serialize/Deserialize at line 53, does the order of node_address_args before handshake_args matter, and could reordering during deserialization bypass validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: CheckEndpointArgs] [Clone atomicity] When cloning CheckEndpointArgs at line 53, are both nested structs cloned atomically, or can interleaved mutations between cloning node_address_args and handshake_args create inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Integration: validate_address + NodeAddressArgs] [Validation bypass through deserialization] Can an attacker bypass the validate_address() check at line 14 by directly deserializing a malformed NetworkAddress into NodeAddressArgs using serde, skipping the clap parser entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Integration: HandshakeArgs + CheckEndpointArgs] [Timeout race condition] Can an attacker exploit timing between when timeout_seconds is validated in HandshakeArgs and when it's actually used in network operations, modifying the timeout after validation but before use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Integration: All structs] [Memory safety] Are all Clone, Serialize, and Deserialize implementations memory-safe when handling malformed or adversarially-crafted data, or could buffer overruns occur in unsafe code within these traits?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Integration: Default implementations] [Secure defaults] Do the default values (5-second timeout, NetworkId::Public, no_handshake=false) represent the most secure configuration, or could different defaults better protect against reconnaissance or availability attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: NetworkAddress] [Type confusion] Does NetworkAddress::from_str() properly enforce type constraints, or can string representations of other types be coerced into NetworkAddress, causing type confusion vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: ChainId] [Enum exhaustiveness] Is ChainId implemented as an enum with exhaustive matching, or could adding new chain IDs in the future cause uncovered match arms in existing code using these args? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Type: NetworkId] [Access control] Does NetworkId::Public at line 24 actually restrict access to public-only endpoints, or could it be used to access validator-only or VFN-only interfaces? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Error propagation] Does the anyhow error chain at line 64 properly sanitize error messages from NetworkAddress::from_str() to prevent information leakage about internal parser state or memory addresses?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Bail conditions] At line 66, does bail!() properly clean up any partial allocations or state from NetworkAddress parsing before returning the error, or could resource leaks accumulate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Context attachment] Is the context message at line 64 format string safe, or could special characters in the address parameter cause format string vulnerabilities if logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [All structs] [Thread safety] Are NodeAddressArgs, HandshakeArgs, and CheckEndpointArgs safe to share across threads without additional synchronization, or could concurrent reads during cloning cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Struct: HandshakeArgs] [Atomic timeout updates] If timeout_seconds is modified after construction, are updates atomic, or could torn reads give partial timeout values (e.g., reading modified upper 32 bits but old lower 32 bits)?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Whitespace handling] Does NetworkAddress::from_str() trim whitespace before parsing, or could leading/trailing spaces bypass is_aptosnet_addr() validation while being stripped later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-network-checker/src/args.rs] [Function: validate_address()] [Case sensitivity] Is address parsing case-sensitive for all components (DNS, protocol names), and could mixed-case attacks bypass validation (e.g., '/DNS4/' vs '/dns4/')? (Low)",
