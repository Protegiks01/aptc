  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [All functions] [Field arithmetic] Does the benchmark verify that underlying Fr field arithmetic (addition, multiplication, inversion) is constant-time and side-channel resistant for all field elements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: pairing()] [Miller loop optimization] Does the benchmark test whether multi_miller_loop uses efficient batch formulas, or could individual pairing computations be faster, indicating optimization opportunities or implementation bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: msm()] [Window size] Does the MSM benchmark test different window sizes in the underlying Pippenger algorithm, or could suboptimal window choices cause performance degradation that enables DoS attacks on batch verification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: pairing()] [Final exponentiation cost] Does the benchmark measure final_exponentiation() separately from multi_miller_loop() to detect if it becomes the bottleneck at large batch sizes, potentially causing validator timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [All functions] [Memory pressure] Does the benchmark test operations under memory pressure or with limited stack space, conditions that could occur on resource-constrained validator nodes and cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: pairing()] [Thread pool exhaustion] Does the parallel benchmark (128 iterations) test rayon thread pool behavior under load, or could thread exhaustion in production cause performance degradation or deadlocks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [All functions] [Compiler optimizations] Does the benchmark ensure the compiler doesn't optimize away operations due to unused results (b.iter() black_box semantics), which could mask timing attack vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: msm()] [Cache effects] Does the benchmark reuse the same gs and scalars vectors across iterations, potentially benefiting from CPU cache warming that wouldn't occur in production with fresh inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: pairing()] [Measurement noise] Does running 128 parallel pairings in each benchmark iteration introduce measurement noise that could hide performance regressions in individual pairing operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [All functions] [Setup cost exclusion] Does the benchmark exclude setup costs (rand generation, G2Prepared conversion) from measurements, potentially underestimating real-world performance impact on validator consensus timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: msm()] [Size progression] Does the benchmark's size progression [4, 8, 32, 128, 512] adequately capture performance scaling behavior, or could intermediate sizes (e.g., 64, 256) reveal unexpected performance cliffs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/msm.rs] [Function: pairing()] [Size selection] Why does the pairing benchmark use sizes [1, 3, 128] with large gaps - could sizes like 10, 50, 100 reveal performance characteristics critical for choosing optimal PVSS batch sizes? (Low)"
