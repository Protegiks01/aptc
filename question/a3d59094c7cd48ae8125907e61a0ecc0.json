  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: MinimalAdapter::init()] [Access Control] Can an attacker provide a named_addresses mapping that collides with aptos_framework::named_addresses() to shadow critical framework addresses like @aptos_framework or @std, potentially redirecting module lookups to malicious implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: MinimalAdapter::init()] [Panic DoS] Does the panic at line 88 when a named address already exists create a denial-of-service vector where an attacker can trigger test runner crashes by providing duplicate address names in InitCommand? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: MinimalAdapter::init()] [State Corruption] If verify_and_create_named_address_mapping() at line 79 returns a mapping with case-insensitive duplicate names, can this cause address resolution inconsistencies between modules compiled at different times? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: MinimalAdapter::init()] [Address Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the order of named_address_mapping insertion (lines 86-91) to create timing-dependent address resolution where earlier test operations resolve addresses differently than later ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: MinimalAdapter::init()] [Input Validation] Does the unwrap() at line 79 on verify_and_create_named_address_mapping() properly validate malformed address strings, or can specially crafted input cause panics or undefined behavior in address parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Struct: TransactionalOperation] [Bytecode Injection] Since TransactionalOperation::PublishModule contains a CompiledModule field with Arbitrary derive for fuzzing, can a fuzzer generate malformed bytecode that bypasses Move's verification when later executed, leading to VM crashes or type safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Struct: TransactionalOperation] [Type Confusion] In TransactionalOperation::CallFunction, the _args field stores serialized Vec<Vec<u8>>, but can an attacker provide args that deserialize to incorrect types, bypassing the function signature checks and causing type confusion in the VM? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Struct: TransactionalOperation] [Exec Group Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the _exec_group field in RunScript or CallFunction variants to cause transaction reordering or parallel execution violations, potentially leading to race conditions in state updates? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Struct: TransactionalOperation] [Signer Forgery] Does the _signers Vec<AccountAddress> in RunScript and CallFunction properly validate that provided signers have corresponding signatures, or can an attacker inject arbitrary signer addresses to execute privileged operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Struct: TransactionalOperation] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a TransactionalOperation with extremely large _type_args or _args vectors that consume excessive memory during deserialization, causing OOM conditions in the test runner?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/testing-infra/transactional-test-runner/src/transactional_ops.rs] [Function: tasks_to_transactional_operations()] [Module Tracking] The published_modules vector at line 217 tracks modules for function resolution, but is it properly synchronized if tasks_to_transactional_operations is called concurrently, potentially causing race conditions in module lookups?
