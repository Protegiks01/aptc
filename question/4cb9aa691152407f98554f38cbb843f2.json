  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: init()] [Feature flag race condition] Feature flags are read during init(). Can flags change during block execution, causing inconsistent behavior between transactions in the same block? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: execute_transaction_impl()] [Mixed migration states] Can transactions from before and after migration be included in the same block, causing some to use Coin logic and others FA logic on shared state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: withdraw_coin_apt_from_signer()] [Migration fallback] When CoinStore doesn't exist, code falls back to FA. Can this fallback be exploited to access FA stores that should require explicit migration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: check_or_create_account()] [Migration account creation] The create_account_resource flag is !fa_migration_complete. Can this create accounts in wrong states if migration status changes mid-execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: get_value()] [Generic type parameter T] Can callers pass wrong types for T, causing deserialization to succeed but produce semantically incorrect data (e.g., deserializing a CoinStore as an Account)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: check_and_set_sequence_number()] [BCS serialization bombing] Can an attacker create AccountResources that serialize to extremely large byte arrays, causing memory exhaustion during bcs::to_bytes()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: check_or_create_account()] [BCS deserialization vulnerability] Can malformed BCS data in state cause deserialization to fail silently via map_err(hide_error), allowing invalid accounts to exist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/native_vm.rs] [Function: create_single_resource_in_group_modification()] [Serialization size mismatch] The serialized value size may not match the reported resource group size. Can this cause Merkle tree construction to fail or produce incorrect state roots? (High)"
