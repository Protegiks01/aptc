  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Downstream Backpressure] Can the downstream StateMerkleBatchCommitter apply backpressure that causes this committer to block indefinitely, creating a deadlock in the state commit pipeline? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [StateMerkleBatch Construction] Does constructing StateMerkleBatch with moved batches prevent any validation or can snapshots be corrupted during the transfer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Snapshot Clone Cost] Is cloning snapshot at multiple points (line 107, 182, 188) necessary, or does this create unnecessary overhead that could be exploited for resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Snapshot Immutability] Are StateWithSummary snapshots truly immutable once created, or can internal mutation violate the assumptions that all validators process identical snapshots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Determinism Guarantee] Does the entire pipeline from snapshot receipt to batch generation guarantee determinism across all validators, or can non-determinism cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [State Linearity] Does the code enforce that snapshots are processed in strictly increasing version order, or can out-of-order processing cause state to be committed non-linearly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Snapshot Gap Handling] If there's a gap in snapshot versions (e.g., version 100, 105 instead of 100, 101, 102...), does the delta calculation handle this correctly or produce invalid Merkle updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/state_store/state_snapshot_committer.rs] [Function: run()] [Persistent Safety] After sending StateMerkleBatch downstream, is it guaranteed to be persisted atomically, or can partial persistence cause validators to have different committed states? (Critical)"
