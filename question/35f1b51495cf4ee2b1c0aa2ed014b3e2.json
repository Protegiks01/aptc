(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/validator_txns/dkg.rs] [Function: process_dkg_result_inner()] [Epoch replay] Does the epoch check at line 96 prevent replay attacks where an attacker resubmits a valid DKG transcript from a previous epoch to force a rollback or create conflicting validator sets across nodes? (Critical)",
