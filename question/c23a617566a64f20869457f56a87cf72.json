  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Cow handling] The function accepts Cow<str> but calls into_owned() at line 106 - can this cause unnecessary allocations when Borrowed strings are passed, wasting memory during compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Entry reuse] When an existing entry is found at line 97, the function returns a pointer to it - can this cause issues if the caller expects ownership of a new Entry rather than a shared reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [List ordering] New entries are inserted at the head (line 108 takes existing bucket) - can this affect the determinism of symbol resolution if insertion order matters for Move compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash determinism] DefaultHasher's hash output may vary across Rust versions or compilations - can this cause different validators to produce different symbol pools for the same Move code, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Bucket take()] At line 108, self.0[bucket_index].take() transfers ownership - can this leave the bucket temporarily empty, causing race conditions if another thread accesses it before line 114 reassigns? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Option unwrapping] Lines 88-101 use as_mut() and take() on Option<Box<Entry>> - can these operations panic if bucket state is corrupted, causing validator crashes during Move compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Recursive structure] Entry has a 'next: Bucket' field forming a recursive type - can extremely deep linked lists cause stack overflow when traversing or dropping the structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Entry drop] When buckets are replaced at line 114, old entries may be dropped - can this cause use-after-free if NonNull pointers to those entries are still held by callers? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Constant: INIT] [Initialization] Line 67 uses 'const INIT: Bucket = None' for array initialization - can this pattern fail to properly initialize all 4096 buckets, leaving some in undefined state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Visibility] Entry fields (string, hash, next) are pub(crate) - can code in the same crate directly mutate these fields, bypassing pool consistency checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Return type] Returning NonNull<Entry> requires unsafe code to dereference - can this lead to unsafe usage patterns in calling code that violate memory safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Pool] [No Drop impl] Pool has no explicit Drop implementation - can this cause memory leaks if the pool contains cyclic references or if Entry destructors are not properly called? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Mutable reference] The function takes &mut self - can this prevent concurrent read-only symbol lookups, causing unnecessary serialization in multi-threaded Move compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Module visibility] The entire module uses pub(crate) - can this allow other crates in the workspace to misuse the pool API in unsafe ways? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Integration] [Symbol lifetime] If NonNull<Entry> pointers are stored in Move VM data structures that outlive the Pool, can this cause use-after-free when executing Move bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Integration] [Determinism] If different validator nodes encounter strings in different orders during Move compilation, can hash collision resolution produce different symbol addresses, breaking execution determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Integration] [Gas metering] Does Move gas metering account for the O(n) worst-case insertion time when hash collisions occur, or can attackers craft inputs to exceed gas limits unpredictably? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Integration] [Bytecode generation] Can inconsistent symbol pool states across validators cause different Move bytecode to be generated for the same source, leading to consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Integration] [Module verification] If the pool is used during Move module verification, can hash collisions cause different modules to be incorrectly treated as identical, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Empty string] Can inserting an empty string",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Unicode handling] Does the hash function properly handle all valid UTF-8 sequences including surrogate pairs, zero-width characters, and emoji, or can these cause hash collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Maximum string length] Can extremely long strings (megabytes) cause integer overflow in hash calculation or memory allocation failures during into_boxed_str()? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Null bytes] Can strings containing null bytes '\\0' be properly hashed and compared, or do they cause truncation or comparison errors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Constant: NB_BUCKETS] [Power of two] BUCKET_MASK assumes NB_BUCKETS is a power of two - can changing NB_BUCKETS to a non-power-of-two value cause incorrect bucket indexing via bitwise AND? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash seeding] DefaultHasher may use different seeds across program runs - can this cause non-deterministic symbol pools if validators restart during compilation? (High)"
