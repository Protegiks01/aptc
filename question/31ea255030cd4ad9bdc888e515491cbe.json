  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the MagicHeaderCheckerConfig during deserialization to inject malicious header keys containing control characters, newlines, or NULL bytes that could bypass validation or cause header parsing confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Configuration Validation] Does the config validation ensure magic_header_key and magic_header_value are non-empty strings, or can empty strings be configured allowing all requests to pass validation and drain the faucet? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker configure extremely long magic_header_key or magic_header_value strings (e.g., megabytes) during config loading, causing memory exhaustion or performance degradation when checking every request? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderCheckerConfig] [Case Sensitivity] Is the magic_header_key comparison case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass checks by sending headers with different case variations (e.g., 'X-Magic-Header' vs 'x-magic-header')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Tampering] Can the config be modified at runtime through unsafe operations, allowing an attacker with limited access to disable the magic header check and drain faucet funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Header Validation] Does the header lookup at line 33 handle HTTP header name normalization correctly, or can attackers bypass validation by using non-standard capitalization, Unicode equivalents, or whitespace in header names? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Value Comparison] Is the header value comparison at line 42 vulnerable to timing attacks that could allow attackers to brute-force the magic_header_value byte-by-byte by measuring response times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Unicode Normalization] Can attackers bypass the header value check by using Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., combining characters, homoglyphs, or different Unicode representations of the same visual character)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Whitespace Handling] Does the comparison trim or normalize whitespace, allowing attackers to bypass validation by adding leading/trailing spaces, tabs, or other whitespace characters to the header value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Encoding Attacks] Can attackers bypass validation by URL-encoding, Base64-encoding, or hex-encoding the header value, exploiting potential automatic decoding in the HTTP framework? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [NULL Byte Injection] Can attackers inject NULL bytes in the header value to truncate the comparison string early, making 'secret\\\\x00garbage' match 'secret' in C-style string comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Header Duplication] What happens if multiple headers with the same magic_header_key are sent in a request - does get() return the first, last, or concatenated value, creating a bypass opportunity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Character Encoding] Can attackers exploit different character encoding interpretations (UTF-8, Latin-1, ASCII) between the config parser and header validator to bypass the check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the error message at line 37 leak the exact magic_header_key name to attackers, reducing the search space for brute-force attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Value Leakage] Does the error message at lines 44-47 provide different responses for 'header missing' vs 'header wrong value', enabling attackers to distinguish between these states and narrow their attack? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Timing Side Channel] Can attackers measure timing differences between the 'header not found' path (line 35) and 'header value mismatch' path (line 42) to infer configuration details? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Function: check()] [Race Condition] Is the config access thread-safe when multiple concurrent requests check the magic header, or can race conditions during config updates cause some requests to see partial/inconsistent config data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/magic_header.rs] [Struct: MagicHeaderChecker] [Concurrent Access] Does the struct use proper synchronization primitives for the config field, or can concurrent mutations lead to data races and memory safety violations? (High)",
