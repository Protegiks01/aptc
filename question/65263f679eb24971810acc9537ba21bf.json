  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Validation] [StateKey format] Can malformed StateKey values in RemoteTxnWriteMsg cause deserialization errors or undefined behavior when used as HashMap keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Validation] [WriteOp validity] Does the code validate that WriteOp contents are well-formed and within size limits before sending, or can malicious large WriteOps cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Validation] [None write ops] Can Some(write_op) vs None distinction be exploited, where None should represent deleted state but is handled inconsistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Validation] [Type safety] Can WriteOp type mismatches between what a transaction produces and what dependent transactions expect cause execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Protocol] [Message replay] Can old cross-shard messages from previous blocks be replayed to cause incorrect state updates in current block execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Protocol] [Shard reassignment] If transaction-to-shard assignments change between execution attempts, can stale cross-shard messages target wrong shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Protocol] [Byzantine message injection] Can a compromised validator inject fake RemoteTxnWriteMsg messages into the cross-shard communication channel to corrupt execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Protocol] [Message integrity] Is there any cryptographic verification of cross-shard messages, or can in-transit tampering modify WriteOp contents? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Protocol] [Non-deterministic execution] Can different validators have different shard execution orderings, causing them to generate different cross-shard messages and diverge? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Index Management] [Off-by-one errors] Can index_offset calculations be off-by-one, causing cross-shard messages to reference wrong transaction indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Index Management] [Wraparound] Can TxnIndex wraparound at integer boundaries cause incorrect comparisons or HashMap lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/cross_shard_client.rs] [Index Management] [Mismatch] Can local indices in on_transaction_committed() mismatch with global indices in dependent_edges due to sub-block boundary issues? (High)",
