  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module: entry_point_trait] [Access Control] Are all three exported modules (entry_point_trait, prebuild_packages, publish_util) intended to have public visibility, or could restricting visibility prevent unauthorized access to package publishing functionality that could be exploited to deploy malicious Move modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module: prebuild_packages] [Supply Chain Attack] Does the public export of prebuild_packages module allow external crates to potentially inject malicious prebuilt packages that could bypass compilation security checks and deploy compromised Move bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module: publish_util] [Code Injection] Could the public visibility of publish_util enable attackers to directly access package publishing utilities and bypass intended security boundaries, allowing unauthorized module deployment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Separation of Concerns] Does the flat module structure without access control separation allow transaction generator code to be misused in production environments where it should only be used for testing/benchmarking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module: entry_point_trait] [Type Confusion] Could exporting entry_point_trait publicly allow external code to implement the EntryPointTrait with malicious behavior, potentially bypassing security checks in transaction generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] [Principle of Least Privilege] Should any of the three exported modules (entry_point_trait, prebuild_packages, publish_util) be marked as pub(crate) instead of pub to limit their scope and prevent misuse by external crates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module Dependencies] [Dependency Chain Attack] Does the public export chain allow transitive dependencies to access sensitive publishing functionality that could be exploited to compromise the module deployment process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module: prebuild_packages] [Build-Time Attack] Could the prebuild_packages module export enable build-time manipulation where an attacker replaces prebuilt.mpb files with malicious bytecode that gets deployed to the blockchain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [API Surface] [Attack Surface Minimization] Does exposing all three modules publicly increase the attack surface unnecessarily for a transaction generator library that should primarily be used in test/benchmark contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/publishing/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Environment Isolation] Is there any mechanism preventing this transaction-generator-lib publishing code from being accidentally used in production validator nodes where it could enable unauthorized package deployment? (Medium)"
