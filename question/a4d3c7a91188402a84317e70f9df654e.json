  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: get_translated_v1_event_by_version_and_index()] [Index Reordering] Can the index parameter refer to different events across implementors or versions, breaking the immutability of event ordering and causing inconsistent event history reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [None Handling] When translation returns Ok(None) indicating no V1 equivalent exists, do callers handle this correctly, or can this cause silent event drops where important V2 events disappear in V1-only systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Translation Injection] Can malicious ContractEventV2 inputs exploit the translation logic to produce V1 events with attacker-controlled data, potentially injecting fake events or manipulating event payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Reference Lifetime] The v2 parameter is borrowed as &ContractEventV2 - can implementors unsafely extend this reference's lifetime or create dangling pointers if V2 events are backed by memory-mapped files or external storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Function: translate_event_v2_to_v1()] [Error Masking] Can implementors return Ok(None) to mask translation errors or unsupported event types, hiding implementation bugs and causing silent data loss in event processing pipelines? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Enum: Order] [Enum Exhaustiveness] The Order enum has only Ascending and Descending variants - can unsafe code or FFI boundaries introduce invalid discriminant values causing undefined behavior when pattern matching on Order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Enum: Order] [Semantic Consistency] Do all implementors interpret Ascending/Descending consistently (by sequence number vs. by version vs. by timestamp), or can inconsistent ordering semantics cause the same query to return different results across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait: IndexerReader] [Send+Sync Bounds] The trait requires Send + Sync for concurrent access, but can implementors violate interior mutability safety (e.g., using RefCell instead of Mutex), causing data races and undefined behavior in multi-threaded contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait: IndexerReader] [Implementation Divergence] Can different implementors return semantically different results for identical queries (same parameters), breaking the abstraction and causing non-deterministic behavior when implementations are swapped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait: IndexerReader] [Error Consistency] Do all methods return anyhow::Result with consistent error types, or can implementors return incompatible errors that break error handling in generic code using the trait? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait: IndexerReader] [Default Implementation] Are there dangerous default implementations for any methods that implementors might accidentally rely on instead of providing correct implementations, causing security bugs in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Cross-method: get_events + get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version] [TOCTOU Race] Can an attacker exploit the gap between calling get_latest_internal_indexer_ledger_version() to get a version and then calling get_events() with that version, where indexer progresses between calls causing version inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Cross-method: get_table_info + get_prefixed_state_value_iterator] [Metadata Mismatch] Can get_table_info() return metadata for version V while get_prefixed_state_value_iterator() operates on version V+N, causing queries to use wrong table structure and accessing corrupted or mistyped state values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Cross-method: get_events_by_event_key + translate_event_v2_to_v1] [Translation Consistency] If get_events_by_event_key() returns V2 events mixed with V1 events, can inconsistent translation between these methods cause some events to appear in duplicate (once as V2, once as translated V1)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Cross-method: All query methods] [Version Atomicity] Across multiple query methods called in sequence, can each method observe a different ledger version creating non-serializable reads that violate snapshot isolation and cause inconsistent state views? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Multiple Methods: limit parameters] [Limit Overflow] In get_events(), get_events_by_event_key(), and get_account_ordered_transactions(), can limit parameter being u64::MAX cause arithmetic overflows when implementors multiply limit by entry size to allocate buffers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Multiple Methods: version parameters] [Future Version] Can ledger_version parameters be set to future versions that haven't occurred yet, causing implementors to block indefinitely waiting for those versions or return empty results masking the invalid query? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Multiple Methods: version parameters] [Pruned Version] Can queries for pruned historical versions succeed and return fabricated data instead of proper errors, allowing attackers to claim historical state that has been irreversibly deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Return Type: EventWithVersion] [Version Embedding] Do EventWithVersion entries embed their actual ledger version, and can this embedded version differ from the ledger_version query parameter, causing confusion about when events actually occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Return Type: AccountOrderedTransactionsWithProof] [Proof Verification] Does the API contract require callers to verify proofs in AccountOrderedTransactionsWithProof, or can implementors return unverified data that callers blindly trust leading to acceptance of fabricated transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Return Type: Box<dyn Iterator>] [Iterator Safety] Can the boxed trait object iterator be downcast unsafely to access implementation-specific state, or can implementors return iterators with incorrect lifetimes causing use-after-free bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait Methods: Concurrent Queries] [Read Skew] Can concurrent calls to different query methods observe inconsistent states due to lack of read locking, where one thread sees version V while another sees V+1, violating transactional semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Trait Methods: Concurrent Queries] [Deadlock Risk] If multiple threads call different trait methods that acquire locks in different orders in implementors, can this create deadlock conditions halting all indexer queries and causing API unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Integration: API Layer] [Authentication Bypass] Does the trait definition allow implementors to skip authentication checks, enabling unauthorized API consumers to query any account's transaction history or state without proper access control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/indexer/indexer_db_reader.rs] [Integration: State Sync] [Consensus Impact] If state sync relies on IndexerReader queries and implementors return incorrect data, can this cause new validators to build invalid state diverging from consensus and creating network partitions? (Critical)"
