  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Information Leakage] Does the InternalError(String) variant expose sensitive internal system information (stack traces, memory addresses, validator identities) that could aid an attacker in reconnaissance or fingerprinting validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Information Leakage] Can the SerializationError(String) variant leak details about message structure, encoding schemes, or protocol versions that could help attackers craft malformed messages to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Handling] Are error messages properly sanitized before being logged or returned to remote peers, or could they expose internal state that violates confidentiality in a Byzantine environment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Type Confusion] Since both error variants wrap String, can an attacker trigger type confusion by causing the wrong error type to be generated for a given failure condition, leading to improper error handling downstream? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(SendError<network_controller::Message>)] [Error Recovery] Does the error conversion lose critical information about the failed message content, making it impossible to properly recover or retry the operation, potentially causing consensus message loss?

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(SendError<network_controller::Message>)] [State Inconsistency] When converting SendError to InternalError, can the loss of the original SendError<Message> prevent proper cleanup of associated resources, leading to memory leaks or channel deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(RecvError)] [Channel Security] Can a malicious validator deliberately close channels to trigger RecvError, causing InternalError propagation that disrupts consensus message processing and degrades network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(RecvError)] [Error Amplification] Does the conversion of RecvError to InternalError with to_string() create unnecessarily large error messages that could be exploited for memory exhaustion when errors are logged or propagated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(RecvError)] [Race Condition] Can concurrent RecvError conversions in multiple threads lead to race conditions when accessing shared error logging infrastructure, potentially causing corrupted error logs or panics?

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/error.rs] [Function: from(RecvError)] [Liveness Attack] If RecvError is triggered during critical consensus operations (vote processing, proposal handling), does the InternalError conversion mask the severity of the failure, preventing proper emergency response?
