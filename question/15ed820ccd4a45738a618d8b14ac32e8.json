(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Enum: TransactionChunkFormat] [Mixed version exploit] If a backup contains both V0 and V1 chunks, can an attacker exploit differences in parsing logic between formats to create ambiguous transaction states upon restoration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Function: default_to_v0()] [Legacy vulnerability] Does defaulting to V0 at line 37 for backups missing format field reintroduce security vulnerabilities that were patched in V1, allowing exploitation of old parsing bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Enum: TransactionChunkFormat] [Format probe] Can an attacker probe for format-specific vulnerabilities by providing the same chunk data with different format tags, exploiting parser differences between V0 and V1 handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Enum: TransactionChunkFormat] [Auxiliary data bypass] V1 includes PersistedAuxiliaryInfo (line 15) that V0 lacks - can an attacker craft V0-tagged chunks that omit auxiliary info validation, bypassing security checks on auxiliary data?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Function: verify()] [Early return exploit] Does verify() properly cleanup state if it returns early via ensure! failures, or can repeated failed validation attempts leak resources or leave the validator in inconsistent states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Function: verify()] [Panic conditions] Can any of the arithmetic operations at lines 77, 82 panic on overflow instead of wrapping, and if so, can an attacker use this to DoS validators by providing backups that panic during validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Function: verify()] [Result handling] Does code calling verify() properly handle all Result::Err cases, or could improper error handling allow restoration to proceed despite validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/transaction/manifest.rs] [Function: verify()] [Partial validation] If verify() is called multiple times on the same backup, does it maintain consistent state, or can an attacker exploit idempotency issues to bypass validation on subsequent calls?
