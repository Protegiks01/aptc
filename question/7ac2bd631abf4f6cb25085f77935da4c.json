  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_version()] [Cache Inconsistency] Can cached block responses become stale after chain reorganizations, causing clients to see different block data for the same version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Non-Idempotent GET] Is the GET request truly idempotent, or can side effects in block retrieval cause state changes that violate HTTP semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_height()] [Reorg Handling] During a chain reorganization, can get_block_by_height() return a block from the old chain that's no longer valid, causing client state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_version()] [Reorg Race] If a reorg occurs between getting latest_ledger_info and fetching the block, can version queries return blocks that are no longer on the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Reorg Detection] Does the function provide any indication when a block might be from a reorg'd chain, or can clients incorrectly trust orphaned blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_height()] [Storage Backend Trust] Does the function blindly trust data from context.get_block_by_height(), or is there validation to detect corrupted storage data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_version()] [Storage Corruption Detection] Can corrupted storage return arbitrary block data that passes all checks, enabling attackers with storage access to forge blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [BCS Storage Validation] Does the function validate that BcsBlock from storage is properly formatted, or can storage corruption cause BCS deserialization exploits? (High)"
