  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Epoch validation] Does the DKGTranscriptRequest constructor validate that dealer_epoch is within acceptable bounds, or can a malicious validator send requests with arbitrarily large epoch values (u64::MAX) to cause integer overflow in downstream epoch arithmetic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Epoch manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator create DKGTranscriptRequest messages with dealer_epoch values from past epochs to trigger stale transcript responses, potentially allowing them to collect and replay old DKG data to manipulate validator set transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Future epoch attack] Can an attacker craft DKGTranscriptRequest messages with dealer_epoch values far in the future (current_epoch + large_offset) to prematurely trigger DKG operations or bypass epoch transition safety checks, causing consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: new()] [Input validation] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on the epoch parameter, or can it accept epoch value 0 which might have special meaning in epoch management, potentially causing undefined behavior in epoch comparison logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Epoch underflow] When dealer_epoch is 0 and downstream code performs epoch-1 calculations for previous epoch lookups, can this cause integer underflow leading to wrapping to u64::MAX and accessing invalid epoch state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Type confusion] Can a malicious validator send a DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse when a DKGMessage::TranscriptRequest is expected, exploiting incomplete pattern matching in message handlers to bypass request-response flow controls and inject unauthorized transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] If new variants are added to DKGMessage enum in future updates, will existing match statements with non-exhaustive patterns fail to handle them correctly, potentially causing panics or undefined behavior in message processing paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Metadata access safety] Does the epoch() method safely handle DKGTranscript with missing or malformed metadata, or can accessing response.metadata.epoch cause panics if the metadata struct is corrupted during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch consistency] Can a Byzantine validator send DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse with metadata.epoch that differs from the original DKGTranscriptRequest.dealer_epoch, causing epoch mismatch confusion and allowing injection of transcripts from wrong epochs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: name()] [String lifetime safety] Does the name() method return static string slices safely, or could changes to the DKGMessage variants cause dangling references if the variant names are modified without updating the name() function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Deserialization bomb] Can a malicious validator craft a serialized DKGMessage with deeply nested structures or excessively large dealer_epoch values that consume unbounded memory during deserialization, causing validator nodes to crash or experience DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Integer overflow in serde] During deserialization of DKGTranscriptRequest, can carefully crafted binary data cause the dealer_epoch u64 field to wrap or overflow, resulting in unexpected epoch values that bypass validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Variant tag manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the serialized enum variant tag to cause deserialization into the wrong DKGMessage variant (TranscriptRequest vs TranscriptResponse), bypassing type-based security checks in message handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Deterministic serialization] Is the serialization of DKGTranscriptRequest and DKGMessage guaranteed to be deterministic across different Rust compiler versions and architectures, or could non-determinism cause hash mismatches in CryptoHasher verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [DKGTranscript inclusion] [Transcript size validation] When DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse contains a DKGTranscript, is the transcript_bytes size validated during deserialization, or can a malicious validator send multi-gigabyte transcript_bytes causing memory exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash collision resistance] Does the CryptoHasher derive macro for DKGTranscriptRequest use a collision-resistant hash function, or can an attacker find two different dealer_epoch values that produce the same hash, allowing message replay or substitution attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash domain separation] Does the CryptoHasher implementation for DKGTranscriptRequest include proper domain separation tags, or can hashes of DKGTranscriptRequest collide with hashes of other types in the system, enabling cross-type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Hash malleability] Can a Byzantine validator modify the dealer_epoch field while maintaining the same CryptoHasher output through exploiting weak hash properties, allowing them to replay requests with altered epoch values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Preimage attacks] If the hash of DKGTranscriptRequest is used for authentication or authorization decisions, can an attacker perform preimage attacks to craft requests with specific hash values that bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Replay prevention] Does DKGTranscriptRequest include any nonce, timestamp, or freshness mechanism beyond dealer_epoch, or can a malicious validator replay valid requests from the same epoch multiple times to exhaust resources or trigger redundant DKG operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Cross-epoch replay] Can a Byzantine validator capture DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse messages from epoch N and replay them in epoch N+k where the same validator set is active, causing validators to accept stale transcripts as fresh? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch-only freshness] Since message freshness relies solely on epoch() comparison without additional nonce or timestamp, can attackers replay all messages within the same epoch window indefinitely until epoch transition occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Request flooding] Without rate limiting or request deduplication based on sender identity, can a single Byzantine validator flood the network with identical DKGTranscriptRequest messages to cause honest validators to waste CPU cycles processing duplicate requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Unauthorized request] Does the message handling code verify that DKGTranscriptRequest originators are authorized validators for the specified dealer_epoch, or can non-validator nodes or validators from wrong epochs send spurious requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Malicious response injection] Can a Byzantine validator send unsolicited DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse messages without corresponding requests, potentially injecting malicious DKG transcripts into honest validators' aggregation logic?
