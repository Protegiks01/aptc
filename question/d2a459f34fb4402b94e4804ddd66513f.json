  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: data HashMap] [Unbounded growth] Since the HashMap has no size limits, can an attacker exhaust all available memory by repeatedly calling set() with unique keys, causing OOM crashes on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Large value DoS] Can an attacker store extremely large values (multi-GB Vec<u8>) that consume all heap memory, bringing down the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Repeated deserialization] Can repeatedly calling get() on the same large value cause excessive CPU usage during serde_json deserialization, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemoryStorage] [Memory fragmentation] Can repeated set() and implicit removal operations cause severe heap fragmentation, reducing available memory for consensus operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Time manipulation] Since set() uses time_service.now_secs() for timestamps, can providing a malicious TimeService mock allow backdating or forward-dating of key updates to bypass time-based security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: new_with_time_service()] [Time service injection] Can an attacker inject a malicious TimeService implementation that returns arbitrary timestamps, corrupting the last_update field in GetResponse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Clock skew] If time_service.now_secs() returns a timestamp in the past relative to existing keys, can this cause ordering issues when comparing key update times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Timestamp overflow] Can time_service.now_secs() return u64::MAX, and does this cause any arithmetic overflow in downstream code that compares or calculates with last_update? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Key name leakage] Does Error::KeyNotSet(key.to_string()) expose sensitive key names in error messages that could aid attackers in mapping the storage structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Deserialization error leakage] Can serde_json errors expose partial key material or storage structure details through verbose error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Serialization failure] If serde_json::to_vec() fails, is the storage left in an inconsistent state where the key exists but with corrupted data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Panic on malformed data] Can malformed Vec<u8> data cause serde_json::from_slice() to panic instead of returning an error, crashing the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemoryStorage] [Data loss on crash] Since all data is in-memory only, will a validator crash cause complete loss of safety data (last voted round), leading to potential double-signing when restarted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemoryStorage] [No persistence] Does using InMemoryStorage in production violate consensus safety guarantees by not persisting critical safety state across restarts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Irreversible data loss] Can accidental calls to reset_and_clear() during testing configurations leak into production, causing permanent loss of validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemoryStorage] [No backup] Is there any mechanism to backup or recover InMemoryStorage state, or is all data unrecoverable after process termination? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Comment line 15] [Production misuse] Despite the comment warning 'This should not be used in production', can misconfigurations accidentally deploy validators using InMemoryStorage, violating all security guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemoryStorage] [No warning mechanism] Is there any runtime check or warning when InMemoryStorage is used outside of test environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Default trait] [Dangerous default] Does implementing Default trait make it too easy to accidentally instantiate InMemoryStorage in production code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [CryptoKVStorage impl] [Key rotation vulnerabilities] When CryptoKVStorage::rotate_key() is called, does InMemoryStorage properly handle concurrent access to both current and previous key versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [CryptoKVStorage impl] [Export key security] Can CryptoKVStorage::export_private_key() be called to extract validator keys even when security policies should restrict such operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Previous version confusion] Can the get_previous_version_name() pattern cause key collisions where 'key_previous' conflicts with a legitimately named key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [CryptoKVStorage impl] [Signing key extraction] Can malicious code use InMemoryStorage to extract signing keys and create forged signatures outside the proper safety-rules validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: get()] [Type parameter abuse] Can callers specify incorrect generic type parameters for get<V: DeserializeOwned>(), causing a different type to be deserialized than what was stored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/in_memory.rs] [Function: set()] [Type erasure] Since values are stored as serialized Vec<u8>, is type information lost, allowing get() to deserialize to incompatible types? (High)"
