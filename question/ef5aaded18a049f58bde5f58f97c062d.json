  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Single player edge case] If there's only one player with all the weight, does verification still enforce proper threshold requirements or can single-player transcripts bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Type: DealtSecretKeyShare] [Share vector type] DealtSecretKeyShare is defined as Vec<T::DealtSecretKeyShare> but there's no validation that vector sizes match weights - can size mismatches cause reconstruction to use wrong shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Type: DealtPubKeyShare] [Public/private share correlation] Do the DealtPubKeyShare and DealtSecretKeyShare vectors returned by decrypt_own_share() maintain correct correspondence, or can indices get misaligned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Partial share corruption] If some but not all virtual shares are corrupted, is this detected during reconstruction, or can partial corruption silently produce incorrect secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Share uniqueness] Are all shares in the returned vector guaranteed to be unique, or can duplicate shares reduce the effective weight and break threshold security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Struct: GenericWeighting] [State mutation] The maul_signature() function mutates self.trx - can this create inconsistent states if the transcript was previously verified or aggregated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Aggregation side effects] Does aggregate_with() modify only self or can it have side effects on other, potentially affecting other references to the same transcript? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone verification] The struct derives Clone - does cloning create independent transcripts or can shallow copying cause multiple clones to share mutable state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality semantics] Does PartialEq properly compare all security-relevant fields including weights, or can transcripts that are different for security purposes compare as equal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Player validation] There's no validation that the dealer Player is part of the player set in sc - can any arbitrary player ID be used as dealer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Vector length validation] Are the lengths of spk, eks, and aux validated to match the expected player count, or can length mismatches cause array access violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_public_key_share()] [Player existence check] Is there validation that player exists in sc before calling get_player_weight(), or can invalid players cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: decrypt_own_share()] [Decryption key validation] Is dk validated to correspond to the player before decryption, or can a player use another player's decryption key to steal shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Impl Transcript] [Trait bound assumptions] The implementation assumes T::SecretSharingConfig = ThresholdConfigBlstrs - can this assumption be violated at runtime causing type safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Impl Aggregatable] [Trait coherence] The Aggregatable impl is constrained on T being AggregatableTranscript - can conflicts arise if T implements aggregation differently than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Type aliases] [Alias confusion] Multiple type aliases like DealtPubKeyShare = Vec<T::DealtPubKeyShare> exist - can type confusion between inner and outer types cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Impl MalleableTranscript] [Malleability safety] The MalleableTranscript trait is implemented but does maul_signature() maintain security invariants when called on weighted transcripts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Config parameter mismatch] The function receives WeightedConfigBlstrs but converts it to ThresholdConfigBlstrs - can this conversion lose weight information critical for security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Config version mismatch] If the transcript was created with one weighted config but verified with another, can config changes between dealing and verification cause security bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Type: SecretSharingConfig] [Config type constraint] SecretSharingConfig is set to WeightedConfigBlstrs but inner transcript uses ThresholdConfigBlstrs - is this type mismatch properly handled everywhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: get_virtual_player()] [Config dependency] The virtual player mapping depends on the config - can config manipulation change virtual player assignments maliciously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: deal()] [Signature key validation] The ssk and spk parameters are passed but not validated - can mismatched public/private key pairs cause signature verification to fail incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/weighted/generic_weighting.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature aggregation] When verifying with duplicated keys, are signatures properly checked for each virtual player or can one signature be reused across virtual players? (Critical)",
