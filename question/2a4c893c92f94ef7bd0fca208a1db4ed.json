  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Pack/Unpack] Do Pack and Unpack instructions that might consume local variables appear in the sequence check, or are they only considered as not involving u? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Vector operations] Can VecPack, VecLen, VecImmBorrow, VecMutBorrow operations in the sequence interact with local u indirectly through stack state? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Parallel compilation] If multiple functions are compiled in parallel, can race conditions in the optimizer produce non-deterministic bytecode affecting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Shared state] Although InefficientLoads has no fields, does it access any global state that could be subject to race conditions during concurrent optimization? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Generic types] If local u has a generic type parameter, does the optimization preserve type parameter information, or can type erasure issues cause type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Struct types] If the loaded constant is a struct literal and u has struct type, does the optimization preserve struct type information and field access safety?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/file_format_generator/peephole_optimizer/inefficient_loads.rs] [Function: optimize_window()] [Reference types] If the constant represents a reference type (though constants are typically not references), can reference safety rules be violated by the optimization?
