  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [BCS buffer overflow] Does `bcs::from_bytes()` properly validate buffer lengths to prevent reading beyond the `data` Vec bounds, or can crafted inputs cause out-of-bounds reads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Unicode normalization] Is the `type_name` string normalized (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD), or can attackers use Unicode equivalents (e.g., 'ℓ' vs 'l', '𝐀' vs 'A') to bypass type name equality checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Null byte injection] Can attackers inject null bytes ('\\0') in `type_name` to truncate string comparisons in C FFI or other contexts, bypassing type validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [String length attack] Is there a maximum length for `type_name`? Can attackers provide kilobyte-long type names to slow down string comparisons or cause O(n²) behavior in type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Case sensitivity exploit] Are Move type names case-sensitive? Can attackers use case variations ('aptos_coin' vs 'Aptos_Coin') to create confusion or bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Right-to-left override] Can attackers use Unicode right-to-left override characters in `type_name` to visually spoof type names in logs/UIs while the actual comparison bytes differ? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Module address spoofing] If `move_name` includes module addresses (e.g., '0x1::coin::Coin'), can attackers use similar-looking addresses ('0x01' vs '0x1') to spoof system module types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Struct name collision] Can attackers create custom Move modules with type names that collide with system types, then use `Any` to confuse which module's type is being unpacked? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Trait: AsMoveAny] [Type name constant injection] Can malicious crates provide fake implementations of `AsMoveAny` with `MOVE_TYPE_NAME` constants that impersonate system types, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Phantom type parameter] If the Move type uses phantom type parameters for access control (e.g., capabilities), can `Any` bypass these by unpacking with wrong phantom parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Borrowed data serialization] If type `T` contains borrowed references, can BCS serialization capture dangling pointers or lifetime issues that cause undefined behavior when unpacking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Move semantics violation] The function consumes `x: Any` by value - if unpacking fails, is the `Any` object properly dropped, or can this leak resources or violate Move's linear type system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Drop implementation] Since `Any` doesn't implement custom `Drop`, are there scenarios where dropping large `Any` objects causes performance issues or resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Transaction serialization] When `Any` objects are included in transactions, is the combined size of `type_name` + `data` checked against transaction size limits, or can this exceed limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::unpack()] [Consensus determinism] If unpacking behavior depends on any non-deterministic factors (system time, random numbers, environment variables), can this cause validators to diverge on transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [State synchronization] When new validators sync state containing `Any` objects, can differences in Rust/BCS library versions cause deserialization mismatches that break state sync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Function: Any::pack()] [Parallel execution] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent pack/unpack operations on the same data race in the data cache, causing non-deterministic transaction outcomes? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_any.rs] [Struct: Any] [Empty data field] Can the `data` Vec be empty, and does unpacking zero-length BCS data correctly produce default/empty instances of type `T`, or does this cause deserialization errors? (Low)",
