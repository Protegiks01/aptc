  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::msk_share()] [Side channel] Does returning direct access to the master secret key share enable side-channel attacks through memory access patterns or timing analysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::msk_share()] [Concurrent access] Since SecretSharingConfig is Clone, can multiple clones access msk_share() concurrently, potentially causing race conditions in cryptographic operations? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::get_peer_weight()] [Hardcoded weight] The function always returns 1 regardless of peer - does this TODO comment indicate incomplete weighted secret sharing implementation that could be exploited if validators assume proper weighting?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::get_peer_weight()] [Stake-based attacks] Since get_peer_weight() ignores actual validator stake, can malicious low-stake validators have equal influence in secret sharing, violating stake-weighted security assumptions?
