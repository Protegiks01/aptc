  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Subscription Service Integration] Does the filtering logic correctly integrate with the actual subscription service, or can discrepancies between the benchmark behavior and production behavior cause critical events to be filtered incorrectly in live environments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18] [JWK Update Filtering] If the should_forward_to_subscription_service() function incorrectly filters out QuorumCertifiedUpdate events, what is the impact on validator JWK synchronization, and could this lead to validators using outdated keys and failing to validate signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Event Priority] Does the subscription service respect event priorities when forwarding filtered events, or can low-priority events (like randomness updates) starve high-priority JWK updates, causing validator key desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Filter False Negatives] What is the security impact if should_forward_to_subscription_service() has false negatives (filtering out legitimate system events) - could this cause validators to miss critical reconfiguration, DKG, or epoch transition events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Filter False Positives] What is the security impact if should_forward_to_subscription_service() has false positives (forwarding non-system events) - could this allow attackers to inject fake events into the subscription service and manipulate validator behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18] [Move Type Tag Validation] Does the type tag '0x1::jwks::QuorumCertifiedUpdate' correspond to an actual Move struct definition, or can attackers create events with non-existent type tags that bypass validation because the filtering logic doesn't check for struct existence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18] [Type Tag Module Path] Is the module path '0x1::jwks' properly validated against the actual deployed module address, or can attackers deploy malicious modules at different addresses with the same name and create spoofed events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Type Tag Generics] Does the TypeTag comparison properly handle generic type parameters, or can attackers create events with generic QuorumCertifiedUpdate<T> structs that match the base type but have different semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18] [Struct Field Validation] Does the filtering logic validate the internal structure of JWK events beyond just the type tag, or can attackers create events with the correct type tag but malformed internal data that crashes downstream processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Move Ability Checks] Does the filtering consider Move type abilities (copy, drop, store, key), or can attackers create events with the correct type tag but incorrect abilities that bypass resource safety checks in the subscription service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 19, 31] [Event Data Integrity] Is there any cryptographic verification of the event data (vec![0xFF; 256]) before filtering, or can attackers create events with tampered data that passes filtering but contains malicious payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 17-20] [Event Size Limits] Does the benchmark test realistic event sizes, or are production JWK events larger than 256 bytes, potentially causing issues when the subscription service processes real events after being benchmarked with smaller test data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 19, 31] [BCS Deserialization] After filtering, is the event data properly deserialized and validated by the subscription service, or can malformed BCS data in vec![0xFF; 256] cause panics or incorrect behavior downstream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Event Authenticity] Does the subscription service verify that filtered events originated from authorized validators, or can attackers inject fake JWK update events that pass filtering and cause validators to synchronize to malicious keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Event Sequence Validation] Does the filtering logic check event sequence numbers or ordering, or can attackers replay old JWK update events that pass filtering and cause validators to revert to compromised keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 17-20] [Memory Allocation DoS] Can attackers flood the system with events requiring ContractEvent::new_v2_with_type_tag_str() calls, causing excessive memory allocation during event creation that exhausts node memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Filtering CPU DoS] Can attackers create events with complex type tags that require expensive should_forward_to_subscription_service() comparisons, causing CPU exhaustion and slowing down event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22] [String Conversion DoS] Does the type_tag().to_string() operation in the old implementation have linear complexity with type tag depth, allowing attackers to create deeply nested type tags that cause quadratic time complexity in string conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 11-36] [Benchmark Resource Limits] Does the benchmark enforce resource limits (memory, CPU time) that match production constraints, or can the benchmark pass while production code fails under real-world load due to resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 26-36] [v1 Performance Impact] If the v1 implementation has significantly different performance characteristics than v0, could this create a migration risk where upgrading nodes experience performance degradation that makes them vulnerable to DoS during high event volumes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 13-24] [Feature Flag Security] Can the 'bench' feature flag be accidentally or maliciously enabled in production builds, exposing the vulnerable should_forward_to_subscription_service_old() implementation alongside the secure v1 version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: criterion_group() line 39-43] [Criterion Configuration] Does the Criterion::default() configuration properly isolate benchmark measurements from external factors, or can network latency, disk I/O, or other factors contaminate results and hide security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: criterion_main() line 45] [Main Entry Point] Does criterion_main!() properly handle errors and panics in benchmark code, or can crashes in the filtering logic be masked by the benchmark harness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 11] [Benchmark Naming] Can the benchmark group name conflict with other benchmarks in the codebase, causing incorrect benchmark results to be reported for the subscription service filtering logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 39-43] [Group Configuration] Does the benchmark group configuration properly measure both setup time and execution time, or can expensive setup operations hide the true cost of event filtering in production?
