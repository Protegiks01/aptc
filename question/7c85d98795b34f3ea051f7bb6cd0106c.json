  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Partial failure handling] If some accounts in accounts_to_use succeed in generating transactions but others fail, the function returns partial results at line 56 - can this cause inconsistent test state where some accounts are consumed but expected transaction count is not met? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Transaction ordering] The flat_map() at line 50 collects transactions in iteration order of accounts_to_use - if transaction ordering matters for test correctness (e.g., dependency chains), can the random account selection at line 44-45 break ordering assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [One-way transfer] Accounts taken from source_accounts_pool are never returned to it (only potentially added to destination_accounts_pool at line 54) - is this 'burn' behavior intentional per the comment at line 12, and can it cause source pool depletion in long tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Pool overflow] The add_to_pool() call at line 54 uses unbounded add_to_pool() method (not add_to_pool_bounded()) - if destination pool has no size limit, can this cause unbounded growth when accounts are recycled in workflow stages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Pool lifecycle mismatch] If source_accounts_pool and destination_accounts_pool have different lifetimes (one is dropped while the other persists), can accounts be lost when trying to add to a dropped pool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Account state inconsistency] Accounts added to destination_accounts_pool at line 54 may have modified state (incremented sequence numbers, used signatures) - if the destination pool is used by another generator expecting fresh accounts, will this cause state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization order] The constructor at lines 22-34 accepts pre-initialized pools via Arc - if these pools are shared across multiple generators with different initialization states, can this cause undefined behavior or pool corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Silent failure on exhaustion] When take_from_pool() returns empty Vec at line 44-45 due to pool exhaustion, the function returns Vec::new() at line 47 without error indication - should this panic or return Result to signal pool exhaustion to caller? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Zero request handling] If num_to_create=0 is passed at line 41, take_from_pool() may behave unexpectedly - is this edge case validated, or can it cause unnecessary pool lock acquisition? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Overflow handling] If num_to_create at line 41 is very large (e.g., usize::MAX), can take_from_pool() cause integer overflow or allocation failure when trying to drain the pool? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Iterator panic] The iter() at line 50 assumes accounts_to_use is valid - if accounts_to_use contains corrupted LocalAccount objects (e.g., from pool corruption), can iteration panic or produce invalid transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Panic propagation] If the inner generator.generate_transactions() at line 51 panics, does the panic properly unwind and release pool locks, or can it leave pools in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Trait: TransactionGenerator] [Contract violation] The TransactionGenerator trait at line 37 expects the provided _account parameter to be used, but this implementation ignores it at line 40 - does this violate the trait contract and break composition with other generators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: generate_transactions()] [Semantic mismatch] The function signature implies generating num_to_create transactions for the provided account, but actually generates num_to_create transactions across different accounts from the pool - is this misleading API design? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperGenerator] [Optional semantics unclear] The destination_accounts_pool is Option<Arc<ObjectPool<LocalAccount>>> at line 18 - what is the semantic difference between Some(pool) and None, and is it documented for users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation missing] The constructor at line 22-27 accepts parameters without validation - should it verify that source_accounts_pool is not empty, or that generator is valid? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Function: create_transaction_generator()] [Generator composition] The inner creator.create_transaction_generator() at line 84 is called for each wrapper instance - if the inner creator has side effects (e.g., incrementing global counters), can repeated calls cause unexpected state accumulation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/accounts_pool_wrapper.rs] [Struct: AccountsPoolWrapperCreator] [Pool sharing semantics] Both source and destination pools are Arc-cloned at lines 85-86 - if these pools are intended to be exclusive per generator instance, does sharing via Arc break isolation guarantees?
