  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module()] [Consensus Divergence] Can an attacker submit a malicious module that passes verification on some validators but fails on others due to non-deterministic error handling in the Location::Module wrapper, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module()] [Error Handling Bypass] Does the error finishing logic in verify_module() properly handle all error types from verify_module_impl(), or can certain PartialVMError variants escape without proper location tagging, leading to inconsistent error reporting across validators? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module()] [State Corruption] Can an attacker exploit the PartialVMResult to VMResult conversion to cause validators to accept invalid modules that violate Move's safety guarantees, potentially enabling resource duplication or double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Verification Bypass] Can an attacker craft a module where verify_function_handles() passes but verify_struct_handles() should fail, but the early return allows malicious code through by exploiting the sequential verification order? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Type Safety Violation] Does verify_module_impl() guarantee that all type nodes are verified before verify_definitions(), or can an attacker submit modules with oversized types that pass definition checks but fail type checks inconsistently? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the sequential execution of verify_function_handles, verify_struct_handles, verify_type_nodes, and verify_definitions be exploited to cause asymmetric verification costs where one validator spends significantly more time than others? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_module_impl()] [Incomplete Validation] Are there any module components (like metadata, attributes, or other binary sections) that are not covered by the four verification steps, allowing attackers to inject malicious data that bypasses limits? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_script()] [Script vs Module Bypass] Can an attacker craft a malicious script that passes verify_script() checks but would fail verify_module() checks if converted, exploiting differences in Location::Script vs Location::Module error handling? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_script()] [Transaction DoS] Does verify_script() properly handle scripts with maximum-sized parameters/types, or can attackers submit scripts that pass verification but cause excessive gas consumption during execution, enabling transaction-level DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_script_impl()] [Missing Verification] Does verify_script_impl() skip verify_definitions() unlike verify_module_impl(), and can this be exploited to submit scripts with excessive definitions that would violate module limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_script_impl()] [Script Complexity Attack] Can an attacker submit a script with deeply nested types that pass verify_type_nodes() but cause stack overflow or excessive memory usage during execution, affecting validator performance? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_script_impl()] [BinaryIndexedView Inconsistency] Does BinaryIndexedView::Script provide the same guarantees as BinaryIndexedView::Module, or can script-specific quirks be exploited to bypass limit checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [Generic Instantiation Bypass] Can an attacker craft a struct handle with exactly max_generic_instantiation_length type parameters and then instantiate it with maximum-depth types to exponentially explode the type complexity beyond intended limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [Option Bypass] Does the Option check on line 54 mean that if max_generic_instantiation_length is None, struct handles can have unlimited type parameters, enabling unbounded resource consumption attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [Index Overflow] Can the cast to u16 on line 58 cause integer overflow if there are more than 65535 struct handles, potentially causing incorrect error indices or missing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [TOO_MANY_TYPE_PARAMETERS Error] Does returning TOO_MANY_TYPE_PARAMETERS for struct handles properly distinguish between struct and function type parameter violations, or can this confusion lead to improper error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [Enumeration Order] Can an attacker exploit the enumeration order of struct_handles to cause some validators to fail early while others continue verification, leading to consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_struct_handles()] [Empty Type Parameters] Does the code properly handle struct handles with zero type parameters, or can empty parameter lists cause unexpected behavior in downstream verification? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Multiple Limit Bypass] Can an attacker submit a function that passes each individual limit check (type_parameters, parameters, return_values) but violates the combined complexity, enabling resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Type Parameter Explosion] Can a function with max_generic_instantiation_length type parameters be called with deeply nested generic types to cause exponential type expansion during instantiation? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Parameter Count vs Signature Size] Does checking parameters and return_values count on line 74-89 account for the actual type size, or can attackers submit simple-counted but complex-typed signatures that exceed intended limits? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Signature Resolution Race] Can the resolver.signature_at() calls on lines 75-76 and 86 return different results if called multiple times, enabling TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) attacks? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Error Code Confusion] Why does line 87 return TOO_MANY_PARAMETERS for return values instead of a distinct error code, and can this confusion lead to improper error recovery or bypass attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/limits.rs] [Function: verify_function_handles()] [Attributes Comment] The comment on line 91 states attributes size is limited by deserializer - can attackers exploit deserializer limits that are higher than intended verification limits to inject oversized attributes?
