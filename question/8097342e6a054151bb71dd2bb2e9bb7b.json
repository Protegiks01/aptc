  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 8-11] [Dependency vulnerabilities] Do the dependencies (aptos_sdk, aptos_transaction_generator_lib, once_cell) have known security vulnerabilities that could affect the safety of prebuilt package handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 28-35] [API contract violation] Does the PreBuiltPackages trait implementation guarantee that package_bundle() always returns valid, safe packages, or can trait users make assumptions that lead to vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Upstream assumptions] Does code that calls package_bundle() properly handle all edge cases (empty packages, missing modules, malformed metadata), or does it make unsafe assumptions about package structure? (Medium)",
