  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Memory leak] Does the Box::new(validate) closure properly manage memory, or can repeated calls to configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test leak memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Global state] Since set_validation_hook modifies global state, can test isolation be violated if multiple tests run concurrently expecting different validation behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Native table tampering] Can the returned NativeFunctionTable be modified after creation to inject malicious native functions or remove security-critical natives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Duplicate natives] If natives::aptos_natives returns a table with duplicate native function entries, can this cause non-deterministic execution depending on which duplicate is selected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Missing natives] If critical security natives are missing from the returned table due to build configuration errors, can this cause transaction validation to fail or be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Native ordering] Does the order of natives in the table matter for security, and can reordering expose timing attacks or other vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [SafeNativeBuilder bypass] Since natives::aptos_natives uses SafeNativeBuilder internally, can incorrect parameters passed to aptos_debug_natives() bypass the safety wrappers that enforce gas metering and feature checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Context injection] Can malicious native contexts be injected through the extension hook configured by configure_for_unit_test(), giving test code access to production data or capabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Resolver manipulation] Since unit_test_extensions_hook uses DUMMY_RESOLVER which returns None/unreachable for most operations, can this hide bugs that only appear when real storage is accessed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Chain ID mismatch] The test extensions use ChainId::test(), can this cause tests to behave differently than production networks with different chain IDs, missing chain-specific vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Null parameter] If native_gas_parameters or misc_gas_params contain null/default values, does this cause panics or undefined behavior in native function execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Parameter validation] Are the input gas parameters validated for consistency and sanity, or can arbitrary invalid values be passed causing crashes or security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Type confusion] Can type mismatches in NativeGasParameters or MiscGasParameters cause memory corruption or undefined behavior when passed to unsafe native code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Boundary values] What happens if gas parameters contain maximum or minimum integer values - can this cause overflow in gas calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Build configuration leak] If the 'testing' feature is accidentally enabled in production builds, how can this be detected, and what is the security impact of debug natives being available? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Symbol exposure] Can the public visibility of aptos_debug_natives allow it to be called from production code paths, exposing debug functionality in deployed validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [API surface] Should aptos_debug_natives be marked as unsafe, #[cfg(test)], or doc(hidden) to prevent accidental misuse in production code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Dependency confusion] Can package management issues cause the wrong version of this module to be linked into production builds, exposing debug natives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Thread safety] Is aptos_debug_natives() safe to call from multiple threads concurrently, or can the global side effects cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Static initialization] If natives::configure_for_unit_test uses static/lazy initialization, can TOCTOU races occur during concurrent access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Hook atomicity] Is the validation hook update in set_validation_hook atomic, or can partially updated hooks be observed by concurrent threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Reentrancy] If native functions themselves call back into aptos_debug_natives or related initialization code, can reentrancy cause deadlocks or corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Memory exhaustion] Can extremely large or complex NativeGasParameters structures cause excessive memory allocation when building the native function table? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: aptos_debug_natives()] [Lifetime issues] Does the returned NativeFunctionTable have correct lifetime bounds, or can it contain dangling references to the input parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/aptos_debug_natives.rs] [Function: configure_extended_checks_for_unit_test()] [Closure capture] Does the validate closure properly capture the GlobalEnv parameter, or can use-after-free occur if the environment is deallocated? (Medium)"
