  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Vector capacity] When creating vec_vec at line 92, is the capacity pre-allocated based on value_vec length to avoid repeated reallocations that could be exploited for DoS through memory allocation storms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Type coercion] When $t is a numeric type (u8, u64, u128), does the conversion at line 94 properly prevent integer truncation or sign extension that could cause value corruption in vectors of coin amounts or stake values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Reference in vector] If $t is a reference type, does the macro properly handle reference lifetimes when storing references in vec_vec, or can dangling references survive beyond the vector's lifetime? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Concurrent modification] In parallel execution, can the vector being processed be modified by another thread during iteration at lines 93-99, causing inconsistent state or use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Type confusion in first conversion] At line 81, when converting to Vec<Value>, can attackers pass non-vector types that are miscast, bypassing the vector type check and causing the subsequent loop to process invalid data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Cross-macro] [Composition vulnerability] When native functions chain multiple macro calls (safely_pop_arg! followed by safely_get_struct_field_as!), can partial success of one macro followed by failure of another leave the VM stack in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Cross-macro] [Error handling inconsistency] All macros return SafeNativeError::InvariantViolation with UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR - does this uniform error handling prevent proper diagnosis of security issues and allow attackers to hide exploit attempts in generic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Cross-macro] [Gas calculation] Do the gas costs for macro operations (argument popping, field access, assertions, vector processing) properly accumulate across multiple macro invocations in a single native function call? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Move VM state corruption] Can repeated macro failures with InvariantViolation errors accumulate to corrupt the Move VM's internal state, eventually requiring validator restart and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Transaction replay] When macro errors cause transaction failure, are the error conditions properly recorded to prevent replay attacks where attackers retry the same malicious transaction with slight modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Deterministic execution] Do all macro operations (especially error paths) execute deterministically across all validators to ensure consistent state roots, or can non-deterministic error handling cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Parallel execution] In Block-STM parallel execution, can race conditions between macro operations on shared data structures (argument stacks, struct fields) violate optimistic concurrency control and cause incorrect state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Error recovery] When macros return SafeNativeError, does the VM properly clean up partially-executed operations (unreleased locks, incomplete state modifications) to prevent resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [System-level] [Type system bypass] Can attackers exploit macro type conversions to bridge between Move's safe type system and Rust's unsafe operations, potentially accessing raw memory or executing arbitrary code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_arg!] [Generic type parameters] When $t contains generic type parameters (e.g., Coin<T>), does the macro properly validate the concrete type parameter, or can attackers substitute incompatible types causing type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_arg!] [Ability constraints] Does the macro enforce Move ability constraints (copy, drop, store, key) when popping values, or can attackers pop values with incorrect abilities violating Move's safety guarantees?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_get_struct_field_as!] [Drop semantics] When read_ref() at line 49-50 reads a field value, does this properly trigger drop semantics for types with custom drop behavior, or can it leak resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_assert_eq!] [Hash collision] If $left and $right are hash values used in consensus or cryptographic operations, can hash collisions cause the assertion to pass incorrectly, allowing block proposal with invalid hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_assert_eq!] [Short-circuit evaluation] Does the macro's pattern matching at line 62 ensure both $left and $right are evaluated even if one fails, or can short-circuit evaluation skip side effects leading to state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/helpers.rs] [Macro: safely_pop_vec_arg!] [Vector reallocation] During the push operation at line 98, if vec_vec needs to reallocate, can this trigger out-of-memory in resource-constrained environments causing validator crashes? (Medium)",
