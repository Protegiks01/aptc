  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: has_write_in_range()] [Large range spans] For ranges spanning multiple shards, can the two-part range query miss writes at shard boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: mark_txn_ordered()] [Remove vs insert ordering] Can the order of operations (remove from pending, then insert into finalized) create a window where the transaction appears in neither set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: mark_txn_ordered()] [Write-only transactions] The logic assumes transactions are either read or write, but what about transactions that do both - are they tracked correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: mark_txn_ordered()] [Idempotency] Is mark_txn_ordered idempotent, or can calling it twice with same parameters corrupt tracker state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: mark_txn_ordered()] [Validation missing] There's no validation that round_id is >= previous round_ids for this tracker - can out-of-order rounds break assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Threshold bypass] If cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold is manipulated, can this cause the partitioner to accept conflicting transactions in the same round? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Round limit] If max_partitioning_rounds is exceeded, remaining transactions go to last round - can this bypass tracker-based conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Discarding logic] In PartitionerV2::discarding_round, transactions are moved between rounds - can this cause tracker state to become stale with respect to actual transaction positions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Tentative acceptance] Transactions move from tentatively_accepted to finally_accepted based on sender ordering - can tracker state diverge from this flow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct field: storage_location] [Location aliasing] Can different StorageLocation values refer to the same underlying state, causing multiple trackers for the same location? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct field: storage_location] [Location manipulation] Can an attacker craft StorageLocation values that cause hash collisions or key confusion, bypassing conflict tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct field: storage_location] [Wildcard locations] Does StorageLocation support wildcards or ranges that could match multiple keys, and can this bypass per-key tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct field: storage_location] [Location comparison] Are StorageLocation equality comparisons consistent with how actual storage access is checked during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct field: anchor_shard_id] [Selection bias] How is anchor_shard_id chosen - if it's based on key hash, can an attacker mine storage locations to control which shard owns them? (Medium)"
