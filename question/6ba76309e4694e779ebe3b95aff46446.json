  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker manipulate `options.output_directory` to write documentation files outside the intended directory via path traversal sequences like '../../../etc/passwd', potentially overwriting critical system files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: parse_root_template()] [Path Traversal] Does the template file path validation check for absolute paths or parent directory traversal, or can an attacker provide a malicious path in `options.root_doc_templates` to read arbitrary files from the filesystem? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [File Overwrite] When `options.references_file` is specified, does the code validate the file path before reading, or can an attacker specify paths to sensitive files like '/etc/shadow' or '~/.ssh/id_rsa' to leak their contents into generated documentation?

(Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: compute_output_file()] [Path Traversal] Does the function properly validate paths constructed from `module_env.get_source_path()` before using them, or can malicious module paths containing '../' sequences escape the output directory?

(Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen()] [Symlink Following] When writing to `self.output`, does the code follow symlinks, allowing an attacker who can create symlinks in the output directory to redirect writes to arbitrary files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: path_to_string()] [Path Handling] On Windows with `ensure_unix_paths` enabled, does the path conversion from backslash to forward slash properly handle edge cases like UNC paths, potentially causing incorrect file access? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_svg_file()] [Command Injection] Does the DOT source string `dot_src` get properly sanitized before being written to the dot process stdin, or can malicious module/function names containing shell metacharacters lead to command injection? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_call_diagram()] [Injection] Are function and module names properly escaped before being included in DOT graph syntax, or can names with special DOT characters cause syntax errors or potential code injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_svg_file()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely complex module dependency graphs that cause the 'dot' process to consume excessive CPU/memory, leading to denial of service during documentation generation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_text()] [XSS] Does the code properly escape HTML entities in documentation text before outputting to HTML, or can an attacker inject malicious JavaScript via crafted doc comments like '<script>alert(1)</script>'? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: doc_text_general()] [XSS] When user-provided headers starting with '#' are converted to HTML headings, are angle brackets and quotes properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks in the generated documentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: decorate_code()] [XSS] The regex REGEX_CODE captures identifiers and creates hyperlinks - can an attacker craft identifier names containing javascript: URLs or onclick handlers to inject XSS payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: encode_html_entities_in_text()] [XSS Bypass] In MDX mode, does the HTML entity encoding cover all dangerous characters, or can an attacker bypass it using alternative encodings like HTML entity references or unicode escapes? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: gen_html_table()] [XSS] When generating HTML tables from spec block content, are user-controlled values in table cells properly escaped, or can malicious content inject script tags? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/move-docgen/src/docgen.rs] [Function: convert_to_anchor()] [XSS] The regex converts markdown links to HTML anchors - can an attacker inject javascript: or data: URLs in the link target to achieve XSS? (Medium)",
