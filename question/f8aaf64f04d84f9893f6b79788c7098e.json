  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Field: jwk_observers] [Observer Lifecycle] Can observers be restarted or modified during runtime, and if so, are there race conditions with concurrent observation processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Type: ConsensusState] [State Transition] Can the state machine transition from Finished back to InProgress, and if so, does this properly clean up old vtxn_guard and quorum_certified data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Type: ConsensusState] [Abort Handle] When ConsensusState transitions away from InProgress, is the abort_handle_wrapper properly dropped to cancel ongoing consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Type: ConsensusState] [Proposal Consistency] Can my_proposal in InProgress differ from my_proposal in Finished for the same issuer, indicating state corruption or message reordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Type: ConsensusState] [Guard Lifecycle] Does the vtxn_guard in Finished state get dropped when the state is replaced, properly removing the transaction from the pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Signature Scheme] Does the BLS12-381 signature scheme used by consensus_key.sign() provide non-malleability, or can an attacker modify signatures to bypass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Serialization] Is the ProviderJWKs structure serialized deterministically before signing, or can different byte representations of the same logical data cause signature verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Nonce/Timestamp] Does the signed ObservedUpdate include any nonce or timestamp to prevent replay attacks across different consensus sessions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Struct: IssuerLevelConsensusManager] [Key Rotation] If consensus_key needs rotation during runtime, is there a mechanism to update it without losing in-progress consensus sessions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Pool Overflow] Can repeated calls to vtxn_pool.put() with different issuers exhaust pool capacity, preventing legitimate transactions from being added? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Topic Collision] Can Topic::JWK_CONSENSUS(issuer) collide with other topic types if issuer bytes are crafted maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Guard Semantics] If vtxn_guard is dropped before the transaction is processed, can this cause premature removal from the pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_quorum_certified_update()] [Transaction Priority] Does the None parameter in vtxn_pool.put() mean no priority, and can this cause important JWK updates to be delayed behind less important transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Field: qc_update_tx/rx] [Buffer Size] With QueueStyle::KLAST and buffer size 1, can rapid updates cause the channel to drop quorum certificates for some issuers while keeping only the latest? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Field: qc_update_tx/rx] [Back Pressure] If update_certifier.start_produce() completes faster than process_quorum_certified_update() consumes, can this cause deadlock or message loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Channel Ordering] Can messages from different channels (rpc_req_rx, qc_update_rx, local_observation_rx) arrive out of order, violating consensus invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Channel Closure] If any channel sender is dropped unexpectedly, does select_next_some() handle this gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Version Overflow] Can state.on_chain_version() + 1 overflow if version reaches u64::MAX, wrapping to 0 and causing version confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Version Monotonicity] Is there validation that new versions are strictly greater than old versions, or can version numbers decrease or stay the same? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Struct: PerProviderState] [Version Default] When on_chain is None, on_chain_version() returns 0 - can this conflict with an actual on-chain version of 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: run()] [Epoch Mismatch] If observers fetch JWKs using epoch from initialization but the actual epoch has changed, can stale epoch data corrupt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: process_new_observation()] [Epoch Validation] Does the function verify that self.epoch_state.epoch matches the current network epoch before starting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/jwk_manager/mod.rs] [Function: reset_with_on_chain_state()] [Epoch Stale State] Can reset be called with on-chain state from a previous epoch, causing rollback of consensus progress? (Critical)",
