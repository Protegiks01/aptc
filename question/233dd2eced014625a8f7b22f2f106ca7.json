  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: next_number() - error handling] [Suffix Error Handling] When an invalid suffix is provided, does the error handling properly reject the input without revealing valid suffix options? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/parser.rs] [Function: parse_type_tag() - error handling] [Depth Limit Error] When the nesting limit is exceeded, does the error message leak the exact limit value that attackers could use to craft maximal exploits? (Low)",
