  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_folded_stack_lines()] [Gas Scaling Consistency] ExecutionAndIOCosts uses gas_scaling_factor but StorageFees doesn't - can this inconsistency cause flamegraphs to misrepresent relative costs between execution and storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: Rec::visit()] [Cost Attribution] At line 161, frame_cost is pushed after visiting children - does this correctly attribute costs to parent vs child frames, or can it double-count? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Unit Mismatch] ExecutionAndIOCosts displays 'gas units' (line 235) while StorageFees displays 'Octa' (line 92) - can this unit inconsistency confuse users or hide gas accounting bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Optional Return] Both methods return Option<Vec<u8>> - under what conditions does None get returned, and could this hide gas profiling data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Flamegraph Generation DoS] Can attackers submit transactions specifically designed to maximize flamegraph generation time, causing profiling to become a DoS vector against validators? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: LineBuffer::push()] [Generic Type Bounds] Does the generic impl AsRef<str> at line 20 properly constrain types to prevent unexpected implementations from being passed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Anyhow Error Type] Both methods return anyhow::Result - does the use of anyhow::Error hide specific error types that should be handled differently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: Rec::visit()] [Match Exhaustiveness] At line 130-158, is the match on ExecutionGasEvent exhaustive, or could adding new enum variants cause compilation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Struct: Rec] [Self-Referential Struct] At lines 111-114, Rec holds mutable references to its own fields - could this create soundness issues with Rust's borrowing rules? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Import: inferno::flamegraph] [External Dependency] Are there known vulnerabilities in the inferno crate version used that could be exploited through flamegraph generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Empty Input] At lines 64 and 204, empty lines return Ok(None) - can this cause inconsistent behavior if some gas profiling data is legitimately empty? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_folded_stack_lines()] [Zero Costs] If all gas costs are zero, does the flamegraph generation handle this gracefully or produce confusing output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: Rec::visit()] [Empty Events] At line 129, if frame.events is empty, is an entry still created for the frame, and could this cause visual artifacts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-profiling/src/flamegraph.rs] [Function: to_flamegraph()] [Maximum Values] How does flamegraph generation handle maximum u64 costs or f64::MAX scaled values - could this cause rendering issues? (Low)",
