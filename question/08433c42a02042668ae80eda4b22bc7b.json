(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Gas manipulation] In the closure at lines 98-167, if a native function sets context.legacy_gas_used to 0 before returning, can it bypass gas charging entirely while the assertion at line 123 passes due to has_direct_gas_meter_access_in_native_context() returning true? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Integer overflow] Can the legacy_gas_used accumulator overflow when summing gas costs across multiple native function calls, wrapping to a small value and allowing transactions to execute with insufficient gas payment?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Double charging] Can the combination of legacy_gas_used and direct gas meter access cause double gas charging in edge cases, leading to unfair gas costs and potential transaction failures? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/builder.rs] [Function: make_native()] [Out of gas bypass] At line 138-140, when LegacyOutOfGas is detected, the assertion checks !has_direct_gas_meter_access_in_native_context().
