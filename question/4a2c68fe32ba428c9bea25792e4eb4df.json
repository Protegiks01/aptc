  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Cross-field consistency] [Limit flag mismatch] Can block_gas_limit_reached be true while block_effective_block_gas_units is zero, or vice versa, creating inconsistent block state that validators interpret differently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Cross-field consistency] [Output limit mismatch] Can block_output_limit_reached be true while block_approx_output_size is zero, allowing conflicting interpretations of block validity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Cross-field consistency] [BlockEndInfo vs FeeDistribution] In V1 variant, can BlockEndInfo indicate zero gas consumption while FeeDistribution allocates fees, creating economic inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Memory safety] [Stack overflow] Can deeply nested enum variants or recursive structures in BlockEpiloguePayload cause stack overflow during processing or pattern matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Memory safety] [Heap exhaustion] Can a malicious proposer create BlockEpiloguePayload with extremely large BTreeMap/BTreeSet that exhausts heap memory during allocation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Resource leak] [Clone amplification] If BlockEpiloguePayload is cloned repeatedly in hot paths, can this cause memory amplification attacks where the same large payload is cloned thousands of times? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Determinism] [BTreeMap iteration order] Does BTreeMap iteration order in FeeDistribution::amount affect fee distribution determinism, or can different validators process entries in different orders? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Determinism] [BTreeSet iteration] Can BTreeSet ordering of to_make_hot StateKeys affect hot state loading order, causing non-deterministic cache behavior across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Determinism] [Serialization non-determinism] Can different serialization of the same BlockEpiloguePayload produce different byte representations, breaking consensus hash verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Type safety] [Generic parameter confusion] Can TBlockEndInfoExt be instantiated with incorrect Key types that don't match StateKey, causing type confusion in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Type safety] [Enum exhaustiveness] If new variants are added to BlockEpiloguePayload in the future, will all match statements fail to compile, or can some silently succeed with wrong behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Unsafe code] [No unsafe blocks] The file contains no unsafe code blocks - but can unsafe code in dependencies (BTreeMap/BTreeSet) be triggered by malformed input? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Access control] [StateKey privilege] Can to_make_hot BTreeSet include StateKeys for privileged system resources that regular users shouldn't access, bypassing access control? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Access control] [Validator index bounds] Is there validation that validator indices in FeeDistribution::amount correspond to active validators with permission to receive fees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Concurrency] [Shared mutable state] Although the file defines immutable data structures, can concurrent access to BlockEpiloguePayload during consensus cause race conditions if not properly synchronized? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Edge case] [Zero gas block] Can BlockEndInfo be created with zero block_effective_block_gas_units and all limit flags false, representing an empty block, and is this handled correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/block_epilogue.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum gas] Can block_effective_block_gas_units be set to u64::MAX, and does this cause overflow when compared against configured gas limits? (High)",
