  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: add_certified_aug_data()] [Early return inconsistency] Returning early when data exists prevents re-augmentation - can this allow Byzantine validators to permanently corrupt RandConfig by getting first write? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore] [Epoch comparison] All epoch comparisons use != instead of >= or <= - can this cause issues with epoch ordering or time-based attacks? (Medium)",
