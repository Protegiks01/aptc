  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Local] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker craft a malicious CanonicalPath containing directory traversal sequences (../, symlinks) that bypass canonicalization, allowing them to reference packages outside intended directories and potentially load malicious Move code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Local] [Path Injection] Does the Local variant properly validate that the CanonicalPath points to an actual directory and not a file, socket, or device, preventing attackers from causing package resolver crashes or reading sensitive system files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Local] [Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race condition where the CanonicalPath is validated but then modified via symlink manipulation before package loading, allowing malicious code substitution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Local] [Canonicalization Bypass] Does the CanonicalPath implementation properly handle Unicode normalization attacks, Windows alternate data streams, or case-insensitive filesystem tricks that could cause two semantically different paths to hash/compare as equal? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Local] [Access Control] Can the Local variant reference paths with insufficient read permissions, causing runtime errors during package resolution that could be exploited for DoS or information disclosure about filesystem structure? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Node Identity Validation] Can an attacker craft a malicious CanonicalNodeIdentity pointing to a compromised or attacker-controlled node, causing the package resolver to fetch and execute malicious Move packages from an unauthorized blockchain node? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Address Spoofing] Does the OnChain variant properly validate that the package_addr AccountAddress corresponds to a legitimate deployed package, or can attackers reference arbitrary addresses to cause package resolution failures or fetch unintended code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Node URL Manipulation] Can the CanonicalNodeIdentity be manipulated to point to localhost, internal network addresses, or cloud metadata endpoints (SSRF), allowing attackers to probe internal infrastructure during package resolution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Package Replacement Attack] If a package at package_addr is upgraded on-chain, does the identity remain stable, or can attackers exploit package replacement to inject malicious code into dependency resolution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Network Partition] Can an attacker manipulate the node field to point to a forked or partitioned network, causing validators to resolve different package versions and break consensus determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Account Address Validation] Does the AccountAddress validation prevent use of reserved system addresses (0x0, 0x1) that could cause privilege escalation if package resolution treats them specially? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::OnChain] [Canonicalization Consistency] Does the CanonicalNodeIdentity guarantee that two URLs pointing to the same node (via IP vs domain, with/without trailing slash, different ports) are canonicalized identically to prevent cache poisoning? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Commit ID Validation] Does the Git variant validate that the commit_id Oid corresponds to an actual commit in the repository, or can attackers specify arbitrary/invalid OIDs causing git operation failures or fetching unintended refs? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Git Repository URL Injection] Can the CanonicalGitIdentity repo field be manipulated to inject git protocol commands, submodule paths, or malicious URLs (git://attacker.com) that compromise the build system during package fetching? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Subdirectory Traversal] Does the NormalizedPath subdir validation prevent directory traversal (../) outside the git repository root, potentially allowing access to sensitive files in the cloning directory? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Branch vs Commit Confusion] Can an attacker specify a branch name instead of a commit ID in the commit_id field, allowing mutable references where immutable commits are expected, leading to supply chain attacks via branch updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Short OID Collision] Does commit_id require full 40-character SHA-1 OIDs, or can attackers exploit short OID notation to create hash collisions and reference different commits than intended? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Git Clone Exploits] Can the repo field contain git URLs with embedded credentials, SSH keys, or hooks that execute arbitrary code during git clone operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Submodule Exploitation] If the subdir points to a git submodule, can attackers exploit recursive submodule fetching to cause resource exhaustion or fetch from unintended repositories? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Repository Substitution] Can attackers exploit repository mirrors or forks by using a CanonicalGitIdentity that differs by only minor URL variations (github.com vs github.io), causing dependency confusion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: SourceLocation::Git] [Oid Type Safety] Is the git2::Oid type guaranteed to be immutable and validated, or can unsafe operations or serialization/deserialization corrupt the commit reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: PackageIdentity] [Name Collision] Can attackers create two packages with identical names but different locations, exploiting package name resolution to cause dependency confusion or supply chain attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: PackageIdentity] [Name Validation] Does the name field validate package name format to prevent injection of special characters, Unicode homoglyphs, or zero-width characters that could cause display spoofing or parsing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: PackageIdentity] [Case Sensitivity] Is package name comparison case-sensitive, or can attackers exploit case variations (MyPackage vs mypackage) to bypass dependency pinning or create shadow packages? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/identity.rs] [Struct: PackageIdentity] [Name Length Limits] Does the name field enforce maximum length constraints, or can extremely long names cause buffer overflows, memory exhaustion, or filesystem path length issues? (Low)"
