  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Functions: encode_key/decode_key] [Round-trip inconsistency] Can certain (Version, Index) tuples fail the encode-decode round-trip test, causing events to become permanently inaccessible after storage due to key corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Functions: encode_value/decode_value] [Value mutation] Can decode_value() followed by encode_value() produce different byte sequences than the original, causing Merkle tree hash mismatches during state verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Functions: encode_key/encode_seek_key] [Key prefix collision] Can Version values encoded by encode_seek_key() collide with full (Version, Index) keys from encode_key(), causing seek operations to accidentally match and return non-existent events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Iterator safety] When iterating over EventSchema, can decode_key() or decode_value() errors cause the iterator to skip events silently instead of failing, leading to incomplete event queries that miss critical transaction logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Snapshot isolation] Can read queries using EventSchema observe partial writes from uncommitted transactions, violating ACID properties and enabling validators to query non-finalized events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Delete operation] If EventSchema supports deletion (via pruning), can malicious deletion of event entries cause subsequent decode operations to fail, breaking validators that rely on historical event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Compaction corruption] During RocksDB compaction, can merge operators or compaction filters inadvertently modify event keys or values, causing silent data corruption that propagates across validator backups? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Type: Version] [Version rollback] Can an attacker manipulate the Version field during backup restoration to overwrite events from newer transactions with older events, enabling historical revision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Type: Version] [Version gap exploitation] If events are stored with non-consecutive Version values due to transaction failures, can attackers craft queries that exploit these gaps to infer information about failed transactions? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Type: Index] [Index ordering violation] If events are emitted out of order during parallel execution, can Index values become non-monotonic, breaking assumptions in downstream event processing logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Version downgrade] Can an attacker store a ContractEventV2 (without key/sequence) in the database, then later query it as ContractEventV1 to inject fake EventKey and sequence_number fields? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Version upgrade] Can decoding a ContractEventV1 (with key/sequence) as ContractEventV2 bypass sequence number validation, enabling replay attacks on event-driven logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Mixed version storage] If a transaction emits both V1 and V2 events, can inconsistent handling of event versions cause API queries to return events in ambiguous formats that break client parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Sync corruption] During state sync, can validators receive events with mismatched (Version, Index) keys and ContractEvent values, causing them to store incorrect events that diverge from the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Merkle proof bypass] Does EventSchema integrate with the event accumulator Merkle tree, or can events be inserted without updating the accumulator, enabling undetectable event injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Schema: EventSchema] [Checkpoint inconsistency] If events are checkpointed separately from transaction data, can validators restore from a checkpoint with mismatched event-transaction bindings, causing execution replay to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/event/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Write error handling] If write_u64 operations fail due to I/O errors, does encode_key() return a proper error or can it return a partial key that causes silent corruption? (High)",
