  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Type Tag Equality] Does the should_forward_to_subscription_service() function use pointer equality or structural equality when comparing TypeTags, and can this difference be exploited to create duplicate TypeTag instances that compare unequal despite being semantically identical? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Lazy Static Initialization] Are the OBSERVED_JWK_UPDATED_MOVE_TYPE_TAG and other type tag constants properly initialized before first use, or can race conditions during lazy initialization cause type tag comparisons to fail intermittently, dropping critical events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Version Skew] Can nodes running different versions of the filtering code (v0 string-based vs v1 TypeTag-based) produce inconsistent results when filtering the same events, leading to some validators receiving JWK updates while others don't? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18, 30] [Type Tag Canonicalization] Does TypeTag::from_str() canonicalize the input string (removing extra whitespace, normalizing separators), or can functionally equivalent but textually different type tags ('0x1::jwks::QuorumCertifiedUpdate' vs '0x1 :: jwks :: QuorumCertifiedUpdate') bypass filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Type Tag Hash Collision] Does the TypeTag comparison rely on hash values that could collide, allowing attackers to create non-JWK events whose type tags hash to the same value as legitimate JWK events, causing incorrect forwarding? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 15] [Benchmark Timing Accuracy] Does the iter_with_setup() benchmark accurately measure the filtering performance, or can JIT compilation, cache warming, or other factors cause the benchmark to report faster times than real-world performance, masking DoS vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 26] [Performance Regression] If the v1 implementation is significantly slower than v0 (as benchmarked), could this performance difference be exploited by attackers flooding the system with events that require filtering, causing validator slowdowns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 17-20] [Setup Cost] Does the benchmark properly account for the cost of event creation in iter_with_setup(), or is the actual production filtering cost underestimated because event creation happens outside the timed section? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 11] [Benchmark Group Overhead] Does the benchmark_group configuration introduce overhead that affects measurement accuracy, potentially masking performance issues in the filtering logic that could be exploited for DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Filtering Throughput] Can the subscription service filtering handle the maximum expected event rate during high-load scenarios (e.g., rapid epoch changes, frequent JWK rotations), or will performance degradation cause critical events to be delayed or dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22] [String Comparison Vulnerability] Does the should_forward_to_subscription_service_old() function using string comparison (type_tag().to_string()) have substring matching vulnerabilities where partial matches ('0x1::reconfiguration::NewEpoch' matching 'NewEpochEvent') incorrectly filter events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 14-24] [Pattern Matching Bypass] Does the matches! macro in the old implementation check all relevant event types, or are there critical events (like the missing NewEpochV2 and RANDOMNESS_GENERATED_EVENT) that were not filtered by the old version, creating security gaps? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22] [String Allocation DoS] Does the type_tag().to_string() conversion in the old implementation allocate memory for each event check, creating a DoS vector where attackers can flood the system with events requiring string allocations, exhausting memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [TypeTag Deref Safety] Does the .deref() operation in the new implementation properly handle null or invalid pointers in the lazy static type tag constants, or can memory corruption cause comparison failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Filter Completeness] Does the migration from string-based to TypeTag-based filtering maintain the same security guarantees, or are there edge cases where the old implementation filtered events that the new one doesn't, creating security regressions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 17-20] [Event Creation Failure] What happens if ContractEvent::new_v2_with_type_tag_str() fails during benchmark setup - does the benchmark silently skip the test, potentially masking critical validation failures in production code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 18] [Type Tag Parse Error] Does TypeTag::from_str() properly handle parse errors for invalid type tag strings, or can malformed input cause panics that crash the node when processing malicious events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Null Event Handling] How does should_forward_to_subscription_service() handle null or empty events - does it safely return false, or can null events cause dereferencing errors that crash the filtering service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [V1 vs V2 Event Handling] Does the filtering function properly handle both V1 and V2 contract events, or does it only check V2 events, potentially missing critical system events emitted in V1 format? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 11-36] [Panic Handling] If the filtering logic panics during benchmark execution (e.g., due to malformed events), does Criterion properly catch and report the panic, or does it silently fail and report incorrect performance metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 15, 27] [Benchmark Isolation] Does iter_with_setup() provide proper thread isolation between benchmark iterations, or can concurrent execution cause race conditions in shared state (like the lazy static type tag constants) that affect filtering correctness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 17-20, 29-32] [Event Creation Races] Is ContractEvent::new_v2_with_type_tag_str() thread-safe when called concurrently during parallel benchmark execution, or can race conditions in TypeTag parsing cause data corruption or incorrect event classification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 34] [Lazy Static Races] Are the OBSERVED_JWK_UPDATED_MOVE_TYPE_TAG and other lazy static constants properly synchronized during concurrent initialization, or can race conditions cause some filtering calls to see uninitialized type tags and incorrectly drop events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: default_targets() line 22, 34] [Filtering Concurrency] When multiple threads call should_forward_to_subscription_service() concurrently (as would happen in production with high event throughput), are there race conditions in the type tag comparison logic that could cause non-deterministic filtering results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/benches/default.rs] [Function: criterion_main() line 45] [Benchmark Parallelism] Does Criterion run benchmarks in parallel by default, and if so, can this parallel execution expose concurrency bugs in the event filtering logic that wouldn't be caught by single-threaded tests? (Medium)"
