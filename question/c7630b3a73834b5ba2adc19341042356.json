  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [State view poisoning] Can an attacker provide a malicious StateView implementation that returns crafted module bytecode, allowing them to bypass Move's type safety and execute arbitrary operations when the annotator loads modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Does the constructor validate StateView size limits, or can an attacker provide an unbounded StateView that causes memory exhaustion when ModuleView caches are populated during annotation operations?
