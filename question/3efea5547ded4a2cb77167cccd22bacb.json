  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal_header()] [Framework dependency] Line 18 always imports aptos_governance, but can this import be hijacked if a malicious module named 'aptos_framework::aptos_governance' exists in the module path, causing proposals to use attacker-controlled governance logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_testnet_header()] [Import order] Dependencies are imported after aptos_governance at lines 42-45, can import order affect symbol resolution allowing later imports to shadow critical governance functions with malicious implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal_header()] [Wildcard imports] If deps_names contains wildcard imports like 'std::*' at line 20, can this import unexpected symbols that conflict with governance functions or introduce vulnerabilities through unintended name collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_testnet_header()] [Circular imports] If deps_names contains circular dependency chains at line 38, can this cause Move compiler errors, infinite loops during compilation, or create ambiguous import resolution that attackers can exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal_header()] [Version confusion] Are the imported modules at lines 18-21 versioned, or can attackers exploit version mismatches where different nodes use different module versions causing consensus failures during proposal execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: finish_with_footer()] [Compilation bypass] After generating the script string at line 66, is there mandatory compilation and validation before deployment, or can syntactically invalid scripts be deployed that fail at runtime causing governance disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal()] [Script caching] Are generated scripts cached based on parameters at lines 70-76, and if so, can cache poisoning attacks inject malicious cached scripts that get reused for different proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_testnet_header()] [Testnet script leakage] If testnet scripts generated at lines 38-57 are accidentally deployed to mainnet, can the get_signer_testnet_only function fail gracefully, or will it grant elevated privileges breaking mainnet security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal()] [Gas limits] Do the generated scripts respect gas limits, or can extremely complex body closures at line 93 create scripts that exceed gas limits causing governance execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: finish_with_footer()] [Output validation] Is the final script string at line 66 validated for size limits, syntax correctness, and security properties before being returned, or can malformed output propagate to deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal_header()] [Memory exhaustion] If deps_names at line 11 contains millions of dependencies, can the emitln! loop at lines 19-21 exhaust memory creating a DoS condition during proposal generation? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: finish_with_footer()] [Writer buffer overflow] If the CodeWriter accumulates extremely large script output before process_result at line 66, can buffer overflow or memory exhaustion occur causing crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_testnet_header()] [Indentation abuse] Can repeatedly calling generate_testnet_header then finish_with_footer without proper cleanup cause indentation stack growth leading to memory leaks or stack overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/utils.rs] [Function: generate_governance_proposal()] [String allocation] The to_string() conversion at line 66 allocates new strings, can rapid proposal generation cause memory fragmentation or allocation failures in resource-constrained validator environments?
