  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Struct: TimeoutConfig] [Method: add_node()] [Default timeout state] Does adding a node with empty timeout set mean no timeouts, and can this create a window where Byzantine RPCs succeed when they should fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Struct: DropConfigRound] [Method: is_message_dropped()] [Round lookup] Can a Byzantine validator manipulate message round values to avoid matching any round in the HashMap, bypassing all round-based partitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Struct: DropConfigRound] [Method: is_message_dropped()] [Chained is_some_and] Does chaining is_some_and() create short-circuit behavior that allows messages through when round config is missing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Struct: DropConfigRound] [Method: drop_message_for_round()] [Round collision] If the same round is configured twice with different partitions, which partition takes effect, and can attackers exploit this inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Struct: DropConfigRound] [Method: drop_message_for_round()] [or_default semantics] Does or_default() preserve existing round config or overwrite it, and can this cause partition configuration races? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_split_network_round()] [Partition verification] Do the test assertions fully verify bidirectional partition isolation, or can unidirectional message leaks exist? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_split_network_round()] [Round boundary testing] Does the test verify behavior at round transitions (round N-1 to N), or can Byzantine validators exploit round transition windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_split_network_round()] [Node coverage] Do the test cases cover all node pairs, or are some node-to-node paths untested, potentially hiding routing bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_split_network_round()] [Single network ID] Does testing only NetworkId::Validator miss cross-network attack vectors in multi-network configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: add_peer_to_storage()] [Protocol ID injection] Can an attacker add peers with custom protocol sets that bypass consensus protocol checks, enabling unauthorized message types? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: add_peer_to_storage()] [Connection metadata mocking] Does ConnectionMetadata::mock() skip validation that would occur in production, allowing invalid peer configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: add_peer_to_storage()] [Duplicate peer insertion] Does insert_connection_metadata() overwrite existing peers, potentially causing message routing to change mid-test and hide race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Function: add_peer_to_storage()] [Protocol set mutation] Can ProtocolIdSet::from_iter() be manipulated to add protocols that bypass consensus message validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Validator set size] Does testing with only 5 nodes miss Byzantine fault scenarios that require larger validator sets to manifest? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Vote recipient selection] Does send_vote(peers[2..5]) miss testing vote delivery to peers[0] and peers[1], potentially hiding equivocation detection bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Message counting] Does wait_for_messages(3) assume all messages are delivered, or can dropped messages cause this to hang, hiding network partition bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Vote message validation] Does the test verify vote signatures and VoteData integrity, or does it only check message equality, missing Byzantine vote attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Broadcast semantics] Does broadcast_proposal() deliver to all validators including the sender, and can self-delivery create consensus double-processing bugs? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Proposal validation] Does comparing proposal equality verify the proposal signature, quorum certificate, and round number, or just structural equality? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Runtime blocking] Does timed_block_on() properly timeout if consensus deadlocks, or can Byzantine validators cause indefinite hangs? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Channel capacity] Are the 8-message channel capacities sufficient for Byzantine flood attacks, or do they mask backpressure behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Random block info] Does BlockInfo::random() create valid test data, or can it generate edge cases that hide consensus validation bugs? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/network_tests.rs] [Test: test_network_api()] [Sync info validity] Does placeholder_sync_info() create valid SyncInfo, or does it skip validation that would catch Byzantine sync attacks? (High)",
