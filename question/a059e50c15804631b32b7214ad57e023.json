  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker set max_network_channel_size to u64::MAX causing integer overflow when allocating network channels, leading to memory exhaustion and node crash causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Resource Exhaustion] Can max_parallel_serialization_tasks be set to an extremely large value (e.g., 10000) exhausting system threads and causing validator nodes to become unresponsive, breaking consensus participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Timeout Manipulation] Can network_request_timeout_ms be set to 0 or 1 causing all network requests to timeout immediately, preventing consensus observers from receiving blocks and forcing perpetual fallback mode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Memory DoS] Can max_num_pending_blocks be set to u64::MAX causing unbounded memory allocation as the observer accumulates blocks, eventually causing OOM crashes and validator downtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Deadlock Risk] Can garbage_collection_interval_ms be set to 0 causing continuous GC operations that block other critical operations, leading to consensus timeouts and validator exclusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Progress Monitoring Bypass] Can progress_check_interval_ms be set to u64::MAX (years) preventing progress monitoring from detecting stuck states, allowing validators to remain in broken states indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Subscription Exhaustion] Can max_concurrent_subscriptions be set to 0 preventing any subscriptions from being established, forcing all observers into permanent fallback mode and degrading network synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Subscription Timeout Attack] Can max_subscription_timeout_ms be set to 1ms causing subscriptions to timeout immediately upon any network delay, forcing constant subscription churn and fallback mode cycling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Sync Timeout Bypass] Can max_subscription_sync_timeout_ms be set to u64::MAX preventing detection of stalled synchronization, allowing observers to remain stuck without triggering fallback recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Peer Change Detection] Can subscription_peer_change_interval_ms be set to 1ms causing excessive peer change checks that consume CPU and trigger unnecessary subscription resets disrupting consensus observation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Subscription Refresh Attack] Can subscription_refresh_interval_ms be set to 0 forcing continuous subscription refreshes that overwhelm the network layer with reconnection attempts causing network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Fallback Duration Exploit] Can observer_fallback_duration_ms be set to 0 causing immediate exits from fallback mode before state sync completes, resulting in incomplete synchronization and state inconsistencies?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Progress Threshold Manipulation] Can observer_fallback_progress_threshold_ms be set to 0 causing fallback mode triggers on any minor delay, creating constant mode switching and preventing stable consensus observation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Struct: ConsensusObserverConfig] [Sync Lag Attack] Can observer_fallback_sync_lag_threshold_ms be set to u64::MAX preventing fallback mode from ever triggering even when severely out of sync, causing validators to operate on stale state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: default()] [CPU Exhaustion] Does num_cpus::get() properly validate CPU count, or can it return extreme values on unusual systems causing max_parallel_serialization_tasks to exhaust thread pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Production Mismatch] Is the default max_num_pending_blocks value of 150 sufficient for high-throughput networks, or can rapid block production cause buffer overflow forcing unnecessary fallback mode transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Conservative Defaults] Do the 5-second default timeouts (network_request_timeout_ms, progress_check_interval_ms) create vulnerability windows where attacks can occur before detection triggers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Subscription Limits] Is max_concurrent_subscriptions=2 sufficient for Byzantine environments, or can this low limit be exploited by malicious peers to monopolize observer connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Disabled Security] Does observer_enabled=false and publisher_enabled=false by default create security gaps during deployment where nodes operate without consensus observer protections? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/consensus_observer_config.rs] [Function: is_observer_or_publisher_enabled()] [Logic Error] Does the OR condition properly handle cases where only publisher is enabled on validators, ensuring that network resources are allocated even without observer active?
