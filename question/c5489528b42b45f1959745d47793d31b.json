  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Request Tampering] Can an attacker intercept and modify the funding request between the CLI and faucet to change the recipient address or amount? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Response Tampering] Can an attacker manipulate the faucet's response to make the CLI believe funding succeeded when it actually failed or went to a different address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Transaction Validation] Does fund_account properly validate that the returned transaction from the faucet is correctly formed and targets the intended address before waiting for it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Transaction Confirmation] Can fund_account return success before the transaction is actually confirmed on-chain, leading to race conditions where subsequent operations fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Gas Manipulation] Can an attacker cause the faucet transaction to fail by manipulating gas parameters, resulting in the account being created but not funded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 52-54] [Nonce/Sequence Conflict] If fund_account is called multiple times rapidly, can sequence number conflicts cause some transactions to fail silently? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Struct: FundWithFaucet, Field: amount] [Zero Amount] Can an attacker specify amount=0 to create accounts without funding them, potentially bypassing faucet rate limits while exhausting blockchain state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Struct: FundWithFaucet, Field: amount] [Negative Amount Interpretation] Even though amount is u64, can type confusion or unsafe casts in downstream code interpret large amounts as negative values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 28] [Unit Confusion] Does the code properly distinguish between Octas and APT units throughout the funding flow, or can unit confusion lead to funding amounts being off by 10^8? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 56-57] [Display Precision] Can large amount values cause integer overflow in the format string, potentially displaying incorrect funding amounts to users? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 46-50] [Account Ownership] Does the code verify that the caller has authorization to fund the specified account, or can any user fund any account address? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Struct: FundWithFaucet, Field: account] [System Address Attack] Can an attacker attempt to fund system addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.) to corrupt system state or cause blockchain consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 46-50] [Address Format] Does load_account_arg properly validate AccountAddress format, or can malformed addresses cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Struct: FundWithFaucet, Field: account] [Checksum Validation] If AccountAddress uses checksums, are they validated in load_account_arg to prevent typos that could send funds to wrong addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute(), Line 55-58] [Output Injection] Can an attacker craft an account address containing special characters that inject malicious content into the success message output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/fund.rs] [Function: execute()] [Rate Limit Bypass] Can an attacker rapidly create new profile configurations to bypass faucet rate limiting by appearing as different users? (Medium)",
