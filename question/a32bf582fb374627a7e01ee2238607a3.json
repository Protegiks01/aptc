  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [State slot API] The get_state_slot() API at line 224 returns versioned state - can this version be out of sync with the actual module version if state updates are buffered or batched? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Runtime environment coupling] The environment at line 97 stores runtime configs - can changes to the environment after module caching cause cached modules to have stale assumptions about VM capabilities or gas costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Module metadata integrity] CompiledModule contains metadata like dependencies and friends - can cache corruption cause this metadata to become inconsistent with actual module relationships, breaking Move linker assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Transitive dependency caching] When loading a module, its dependencies must also be cached - can dependency resolution bugs cause incomplete or incorrect transitive closures to be cached, leading to linker errors or wrong function calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Override mechanism abuse] The get_module_bytes_override() at line 148 is intended for mainnet framework - can this mechanism be abused post-deployment to inject unauthorized module updates that bypass governance? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [StateValue bytes mutation] The set_bytes() call at line 151 mutates the StateValue - can this cause the state_value's hash or metadata to become inconsistent with its bytes, breaking Merkle tree integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Version type compatibility] Version uses usize which varies by architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit) - can version numbers that fit in 64-bit storage be truncated on 32-bit validators, causing version mismatch and cache inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Concurrent modification] The UnsyncModuleCache is not thread-safe - if CachedModuleView is shared across threads via Arc or similar, can concurrent access cause data races despite Rust's safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Cache eviction policy] There's no cache eviction or LRU policy - can this cause memory to grow unbounded over time as new modules are deployed, eventually causing validators to run out of memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Module uniqueness] Multiple modules can have the same bytecode but different versions - can this cause cache key collisions if the cache uses only module_id without considering version, leading to version confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Verification state persistence] insert_verified_module() at line 188 caches verified modules - can this verification state become stale if the verifier rules change via governance, causing previously-safe modules to become unsafe? (High)"
