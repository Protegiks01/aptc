  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Panic Recovery] Are panics in setup_network() properly caught and recovered, or do they crash the entire process including potentially other running networks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Constants: TEST_RPC_PROTOCOL] [Protocol Overlap] Does ProtocolId::ConsensusRpcBcs used as TEST_RPC_PROTOCOL conflict with actual consensus RPC, allowing test traffic to interfere with real consensus operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Constants: TEST_DIRECT_SEND_PROTOCOL] [Protocol Overlap] Does ProtocolId::ConsensusDirectSendBcs used as TEST_DIRECT_SEND_PROTOCOL conflict with actual consensus direct send, enabling protocol confusion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: dummy_network_config()] [Protocol Validation] Are protocol IDs validated to ensure they're appropriate for test environments, or can arbitrary protocol IDs be injected compromising protocol segregation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: dummy_network_config()] [Protocol Duplication] What happens if the same protocol ID appears in both direct_send_protocols and rpc_protocols vectors, causing protocol handler confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Peer ID Collision] Can PeerId::random() generate duplicate peer IDs across different network instances, causing peer confusion and message routing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Public Key Collection] Is the dialer_pubkeys HashSet properly validated for duplicates or empty sets before use, or can invalid key sets bypass authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Empty Address Vector] Can Peer::new() or Peer::from_addrs() be called with empty address vectors, creating unreachable peers that cause connection timeouts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Struct: DummyNetwork] [Resource Cleanup] Does DummyNetwork properly clean up runtime, network clients, and event streams when dropped, or can resource leaks accumulate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: setup_network()] [Listen Address Exposure] Can network_builder.listen_address() expose the actual bound address to untrusted code, allowing attackers to learn validator network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/dummy.rs] [Function: dummy_network_config()] [Config Clone] Is the Config::new(NETWORK_CHANNEL_SIZE) properly validated, or can extremely small values cause channel exhaustion and extremely large values cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)"
