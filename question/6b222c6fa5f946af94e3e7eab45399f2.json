  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Chain ID spoofing] If an attacker controls both buckets and sets matching but wrong chain_ids, can they cause verification of incorrect chain data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Symlink/redirect attacks] Can an attacker use bucket redirects or symlinks to cause the checker to compare wrong files while thinking they're verifying the correct versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_raw_file()] [Cloud storage API version] Does the cloud_storage::Client API have version skew issues that could cause different download results across checker instances? (Low)",
