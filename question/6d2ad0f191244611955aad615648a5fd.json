  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [Empty CFG] If cfg.num_blocks() returns 0, do the pre-allocated vectors at lines 77-80 work correctly, or can empty vectors cause panics when entry block is processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [Single Block CFG] If CFG has only entry block with no successors, does DFS complete correctly with all vectors properly initialized? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [Shared CFG Access] If the input CFG is shared across threads and modified during DFS, can this cause inconsistent reads of successors() leading to corrupted loop analysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopPartition::containing_loop()] [Concurrent Path Compression] If multiple threads call containing_loop() simultaneously on the same LoopPartition, can concurrent mutations of parents vector cause data races despite Rust's borrow checker? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopPartition::collapse_loop()] [Concurrent Collapse] If two threads collapse different loops simultaneously, can concurrent writes to parents and depths cause corruption of the disjoint-set structure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [Vector Capacity] Vectors at lines 77-80 are initialized with capacity num_blocks. If num_blocks is u16::MAX (65535), can this cause excessive memory allocation even for small CFGs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [BTreeMap Growth] The exploration BTreeMap at line 87 grows during DFS. For very large CFGs, can BTreeMap rebalancing operations cause verification to slow down significantly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopPartition::containing_loop()] [Descendants Vector] At line 207, descendants vector is allocated. Can malicious CFG structures force this to grow to num_blocks size, causing redundant memory allocation on every containing_loop() call? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [DFS Completeness] Does the iterative DFS guarantee to visit all reachable blocks, or can certain CFG shapes (e.g., with specific successor orderings) cause blocks to be skipped? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopSummary::new()] [Edge Classification Correctness] Are the three edge classes (tree, back, cross/forward) correctly identified according to standard DFS theory, or can implementation details cause misclassification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: is_descendant()] [Descendant Relation Correctness] Does the range-based check at line 162 correctly implement the ancestor-descendant relation in a DFST, or can edge cases (e.g., NodeId(0), NodeId(u16::MAX)) cause false positives/negatives? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: LoopPartition::containing_loop()] [Union-Find Correctness] Does the path compression algorithm correctly implement the union-find find operation, or can certain parent structures cause incorrect representative nodes to be returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: back_edges()] [Tarjan Algorithm Input] Back edges returned by this function are used in Tarjan's reducibility check.

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: pred_edges()] [Non-Back Edges] Pred edges include both tree and cross/forward edges. If downstream algorithms assume preds only contains tree edges, can this cause incorrect loop body calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/loop_summary.rs] [Function: preorder()] [Tarjan Traversal Order] Tarjan's algorithm requires specific traversal order. If preorder() doesn't match expected order, can this cause the algorithm to fail in detecting irreducible CFGs? (Critical)"
