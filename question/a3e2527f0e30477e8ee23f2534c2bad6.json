  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::Success] [Gas metering bypass] Can a malicious native function return NativeResult::Success with a zero or artificially low cost value to avoid gas charges while performing expensive operations, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::Success] [Integer overflow] Can the InternalGas cost field overflow when accumulating gas costs across multiple native calls, causing gas metering to wrap around and execute transactions with negative effective cost? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::Abort] [Gas manipulation] Can an attacker craft a native function that performs expensive computation before returning NativeResult::Abort, causing the VM to charge the abort cost while having already consumed significantly more resources? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::OutOfGas] [Partial cost manipulation] Can a malicious native function return NativeResult::OutOfGas with a partial_cost of zero after consuming significant resources, effectively getting free computation before the out-of-gas condition? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::OutOfGas] [DoS via repeated out-of-gas] Can an attacker craft transactions that repeatedly trigger OutOfGas in native functions with high partial costs, causing validators to waste resources on partially executed operations that never complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Gas cost inconsistency] When CallFunction transfers control to another function, can the cost field be manipulated to not account for the full execution cost of the target function, causing under-charging? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::LoadModule] [Missing gas charge] Does LoadModule return without a cost field, potentially allowing free module loading operations that should be charged for dependency loading and verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::Abort] [Abort code forgery] Can a native function return arbitrary abort codes that mimic system-level errors (e.g., OUT_OF_GAS, ARITHMETIC_ERROR) to hide malicious behavior or cause incorrect error handling in the VM? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::Abort] [Abort code collision] Are abort codes from native functions properly namespaced to prevent collisions with Move bytecode abort codes, or can attackers craft abort codes that override critical error conditions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: err()] [Special abort code handling] Can the abort_code parameter accept StatusCode values that should only be used for VM invariant violations, allowing native functions to trigger incorrect error recovery paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Type signature mismatch] The documentation states the native function must have the same type signature as the dispatch target plus an extra argument - can an attacker craft a CallFunction that violates this convention to cause type confusion or stack corruption in the VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Recursive dispatch] Can a malicious native function use CallFunction to recursively call itself or create circular call chains, bypassing stack depth limits and causing stack overflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Module/function validation] Are the module_name and func_name fields properly validated to prevent dispatching to non-existent functions, private functions, or system-internal functions that should not be callable via this mechanism? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Type argument injection] Can an attacker manipulate the ty_args vector to inject arbitrary type arguments when dispatching to the target function, potentially violating type safety or accessing unauthorized resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Argument tampering] Can the args SmallVec be crafted with incorrect number or types of arguments for the target function, causing the VM to execute with corrupted stack state? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Cross-module privilege escalation] Can CallFunction be used to jump to privileged functions in system modules (e.g., 0x1::aptos_governance) that should only be callable through proper access control checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Paranoid mode bypass] The comment mentions 'errors in paranoid mode' - can attackers craft CallFunction payloads that pass normal validation but fail only in paranoid mode, allowing production exploits while evading testing? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::CallFunction] [Gas metering evasion] When control transfers to the dispatched function, is gas metering properly maintained across the boundary, or can attackers jump to expensive functions while having only paid for the native function cost? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::LoadModule] [Arbitrary module loading] Can a malicious native function use LoadModule to load any module without proper access control, potentially loading unverified or malicious modules into the VM?

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::LoadModule] [Dependency charging bypass] The comment mentions 'charge dependency for such operation' - is this charging actually enforced, or can LoadModule return without proper gas accounting for expensive module loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::LoadModule] [Module verification bypass] When LoadModule loads a module, does it bypass bytecode verification that normal module loading requires, potentially allowing execution of invalid bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Enum: NativeResult::LoadModule] [Circular dependency attack] Can LoadModule be used to create circular module dependencies that cause infinite loops or excessive resource consumption during module loading? (Medium)",
