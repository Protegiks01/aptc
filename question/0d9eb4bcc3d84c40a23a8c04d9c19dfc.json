(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result()] [Iterator reuse] Can the iterator returned by unpack_with_tag() be reused across multiple unwrap operations, potentially allowing the same Result value to be unwrapped multiple times and violating move semantics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Tag position validation] Do these functions validate that the variant tag is actually the first element in the Struct, or can malformed Structs with the tag in a different position cause incorrect unpacking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result()] [Invariant violation handling] When unwrap_result() line 34-35 returns PartialVMError with invariant_violation, does this error propagate correctly through the VM's error handling, or can it be caught and suppressed by malicious native functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_err_result()] [Error message injection] In unwrap_err_result() line 45-46, the error message 'invalid result value: expected Err(_)' is static - can this message be exploited for information disclosure about internal VM state or contract logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: is_ok_result_ref()] [Error propagation] Does is_ok_result_ref() properly propagate errors from value_as::<StructRef>() and test_variant(), or can certain error conditions be silently swallowed causing incorrect boolean results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Panic safety] Can unwrap_result() or unwrap_err_result() panic instead of returning PartialVMError under certain edge cases, causing transaction abort and potential DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: is_ok_result_ref()] [Boolean return validation] Does is_ok_result_ref() guarantee it returns exactly Value::bool(true) or Value::bool(false), or can corrupted PartialVMResult propagation cause it to return other Value types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result()] [Match arm safety] In the match statement at line 32, the '_' wildcard catches both None and Some(x) where tag != OK_VARIANT - can this conflation hide bugs where None should be handled differently than wrong-tag cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_err_result()] [Error code consistency] Does unwrap_err_result() use the same error code (UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR) as unwrap_result(), and could this make it difficult to distinguish between different error sources during debugging or exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result(), unwrap_err_result()] [Error context loss] When these functions return PartialVMError, is sufficient context preserved about the failed unwrap operation (e.g., which Result type, from which contract) to prevent confusion in multi-contract scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: ok_result()] [Memory allocation] Does ok_result() properly handle memory allocation failures when calling Struct::pack_variant(), or can OOM conditions during Result creation cause undefined behavior or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/src/natives/result.rs] [Function: unwrap_result()] [Value lifetime] When unwrap_result() extracts value x from the Struct and returns it, are there any dangling references or use-after-free risks if the original Struct is still referenced elsewhere?
