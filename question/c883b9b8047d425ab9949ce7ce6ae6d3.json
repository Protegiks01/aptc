  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Economic: Deposit arbitrage] Can attackers front-run governance proposals that lower RequiredGasDeposit::gas_amount to submit high-cost randomness transactions under old high-deposit rules, then claim refunds at new lower rates for profit? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Economic: Free randomness] If gas_amount is set to Some(0), can attackers spam free randomness API calls to generate unlimited random values for off-chain gambling exploitation without paying gas fees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Economic: Gas price manipulation] Can RequiredGasDeposit be exploited in combination with gas price manipulation to make randomness artificially expensive during high-demand periods, enabling economic attacks on DApps dependent on randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Economic: Deposit griefing] Can malicious actors submit transactions with exactly RequiredGasDeposit::gas_amount as balance, causing their transactions to pass prologue but fail during execution, wasting validator resources and degrading network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Type safety: OnChainConfig trait line 23-26, 49-52] [Trait implementation] Can the OnChainConfig trait be implemented for types other than RequiredGasDeposit/AllowCustomMaxGasFlag with same MODULE_IDENTIFIER, causing config fetch operations to return wrong types leading to deserialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Type safety: AsMoveValue trait line 28-32, 54-57] [Trait bounds] Are there trait bound constraints preventing malicious implementations of AsMoveValue that could inject arbitrary MoveValue during config serialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Type safety: Struct derivations line 8, 34] [Macro safety] Can the Deserialize/Serialize derive macros be exploited via malicious attributes or conditional compilation flags to generate unsafe deserialization code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Type safety: Option<u64> handling line 10] [Null pointer] Can None values in Option<u64> cause null pointer dereferences if the Option is unsafely unwrapped in Rust code paths that don't expect missing configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Concurrency: Parallel execution] During Block-STM parallel transaction execution, can concurrent reads of RequiredGasDeposit by multiple threads cause race conditions where some transactions see old gas_amount while others see new values within the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Concurrency: Config fetch] Is OnChainConfig::fetch_config() thread-safe when called concurrently by multiple validator threads, or can data races corrupt the returned RequiredGasDeposit values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Concurrency: Epoch boundary] At exact epoch boundaries when on_new_epoch() updates configs, can transactions in-flight see partially updated state where RequiredGasDeposit is new but AllowCustomMaxGasFlag is old? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Concurrency: Mempool interaction] Can transactions validated in mempool with old RequiredGasDeposit values become invalid after config update but before block inclusion, causing repeated validation failures and mempool thrashing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Randomness: Biasability bypass] Can attackers exploit RequiredGasDeposit deposit requirements to make test-and-abort attacks economically viable by setting gas_amount low enough that biasing randomness through transaction abortion is profitable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-labs/aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/randomness_api_v0_config.rs] [Randomness: VRF manipulation] Does RequiredGasDeposit affect VRF-based leader election randomness, and can manipulation of gas_amount values influence which validators are selected as leaders, enabling validator set manipulation?
