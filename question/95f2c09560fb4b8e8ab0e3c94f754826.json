  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: new()] [Token storage] How is the token parameter securely passed to new() - can it leak through logs, core dumps, or process listings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Export restrictions] Should export_private_key() be restricted to specific operational contexts (backup only), or is unrestricted export acceptable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Production safeguards] Does reset_and_clear() have sufficient safeguards (confirmation, auth checks) to prevent accidental production data deletion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Version tracking] After rotate_key(), does secret_versions need updating for the new key version, or can version mismatches break subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: create_key()] [State consistency] If create_key() succeeds but returns Err from get_public_key(), is the created key leaked in Vault without tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: set()] [Consistency guarantee] Does the use_cas mechanism provide linearizable consistency, or can concurrent operations violate consistency guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Trait: KVStorage] [Type requirements] Are DeserializeOwned and Serialize bounds sufficient to prevent dangerous types (like raw pointers) from being stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Trait: CryptoStorage] [Key name validation] Should crypto operation functions validate key name format to prevent accidental access to system keys or invalid names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: sign_using_version()] [Version safety] Can sign_using_version() be misused to sign with intentionally old/compromised keys, bypassing key rotation security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Overall architecture] [Vault failure] If Vault becomes permanently unavailable, can validators recover access to their keys through any backup mechanism, or are funds permanently lost? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Backup strategy] Is there a documented and tested backup/restore procedure using export/import functions that ensures validator continuity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/vault.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Key migration] Can validators migrate between different Vault instances or back to on-disk storage without downtime or security risks? (Medium)"
