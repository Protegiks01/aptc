  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Timestamp Payload Size] Does the check at line 434 for payload.len() != TIMESTAMP_SIZE properly reject all invalid timestamp sizes, or can an attacker send a payload with extra padding that passes this check?

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Replay Window] Between checking is_replay() and calling store_timestamp(), can two concurrent connections from the same public key both pass the replay check, allowing a replay attack during this race window? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [RWLock Poisoning] If the anti_replay_timestamps RwLock is poisoned due to a panic in another thread, does the code properly handle this error, or can it lead to a denial of service? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read()] [EOF Handling] Is there a difference between ReadState::Eof(Ok(())) and ReadState::Eof(Err(())), and can an attacker exploit this distinction to cause inconsistent connection termination behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Constant: MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_LENGTH] [Size Validation] Is MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_LENGTH correctly calculated as noise::decrypted_len(noise::MAX_SIZE_NOISE_MSG), or could size mismatches lead to buffer overflows? (High)",
