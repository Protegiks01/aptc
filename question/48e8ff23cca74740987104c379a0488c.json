  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Function: dial()] [Outbound limits] Does dial() enforce limits on concurrent outbound connections per peer or globally, or can validators exhaust resources by initiating excessive dial attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Lines 564-569] [Dial amplification] Each dial() call creates an upgrade_fut future - can an attacker cause validators to create millions of dial futures exhausting memory before any timeout occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Lines 280-293] [Security logging] When should_security_log() returns true for Noise handshake errors, does the sampled logging leak information about peer authentication attempts that helps attackers refine attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Lines 312-317] [Error detail leakage] The error message for handshake negotiation failure includes peer_id.short_str() - does this help attackers map network topology by correlating connection attempts? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Function: dial() and listen_on()] [Bidirectional race] Can validators have simultaneous inbound and outbound connections to the same peer in progress, and does this cause race conditions in connection deduplication or metadata tracking? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Constant: APTOS_TCP_TRANSPORT] [Buffer configuration] The tcp_buff_cfg uses default values - can these defaults be inadequate for high-throughput validators leading to packet loss and consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Lines 564, 611] [Base transport] The base_transport.dial() and base_transport.listen_on() are called without additional validation - can vulnerabilities in base transport implementations bypass Aptos security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [State transition] The upgrade sequence: socket -> proxy protocol -> noise handshake -> exchange handshake - can attackers inject state between these steps to corrupt the upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/transport/mod.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [Upgrade ordering] Lines 345-407 show noise handshake happens before protocol negotiation - can attackers exploit this ordering to establish authenticated but misconfigured connections? (Medium)",
