  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Test: test_normalize_path()] [No Unicode Tests] Are there test cases for Unicode paths, homoglyph attacks, or various Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Test: test_normalize_path()] [No Symlink Tests] The test function doesn't test actual symlink resolution or canonicalization - can this lead to undiscovered bugs in real-world symlink handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Test: test_normalize_path()] [No Edge Case Tests] Are there tests for extremely long paths, paths with thousands of components, or paths near system limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Test: test_normalize_path()] [No Malicious Input Tests] Does the test suite include deliberately malicious paths designed to exploit normalization logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Supply Chain] Can an attacker publish a malicious Move package with crafted paths in its manifest that, when resolved by other packages depending on it, cause unintended file access or code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Validator Compromise] If an attacker gains partial access to a validator filesystem, can path manipulation be used to escalate privileges by accessing validator keys or consensus state that should be protected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Governance Manipulation] Can malicious governance proposals include Move packages with exploited paths that, when verified by validators, access or modify governance-related files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Determinism Break] Can platform-specific path handling differences cause the same Move package to compile differently on different validator nodes, breaking deterministic execution and causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Timing Side Channel] Can path resolution timing be used as a side channel to determine file existence or directory structure on validator nodes, leaking sensitive information about node configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Attack: Storage Exhaustion] Can an attacker create a package with circular symlinks or deeply nested path structures that cause excessive storage consumption when cached or logged by validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Safety] Can any inputs cause normalize_path() to panic rather than returning an error, potentially crashing validator nodes during package resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Error Handling] [Result Unwrapping] How are errors from CanonicalPath::new() handled by callers - are there any unsafe unwraps that could cause panics on invalid paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Component Handling] What happens if path components contain empty strings or unusual Unicode characters - does normalize_path() handle these correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Edge Case] [Root Directory Edge Cases] How does normalize_path() handle edge cases like '/' vs '/.' vs '/..' - are they all normalized to '/' consistently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Edge Case] [Mixed Separators] On Windows, are both forward slashes and backslashes handled correctly, or can mixing them bypass normalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Memory Safety] [No Unsafe Blocks] While the file contains no unsafe blocks, does it correctly interface with std::path which may use unsafe internally, especially in canonicalize()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Memory Safety] [OsStr Handling] Does the conversion from Path components to OsStr at line 69 handle non-UTF8 paths correctly on all platforms, or can this cause data loss or corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/path.rs] [Memory Safety] [Lifetime Safety] Are the lifetime relationships between CanonicalPath/NormalizedPath and the underlying PathBuf safe when used in complex scenarios with references? (Low)"
