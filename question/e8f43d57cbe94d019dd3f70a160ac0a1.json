  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker cause the internal usize value to overflow by creating billions of symbols, leading to symbol collision where Symbol(usize::MAX + 1) wraps to Symbol(0) and returns wrong string data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Type confusion] Can symbols from different SymbolPool instances be mixed, where Symbol(5) from pool A accidentally retrieves string at index 5 from pool B, causing incorrect Move type resolution or identifier confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: display()] [Lifetime violation] Could improper lifetime handling in SymbolDisplay allow dangling references if the SymbolPool is dropped before the display object is used, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to make() from multiple threads cause race conditions in RefCell::borrow_mut(), where simultaneous insertions lead to inconsistent lookup table state or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker exhaust validator memory by repeatedly calling make() with unique strings during Move compilation, causing OOM crashes and validator unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Hash collision] Does the HashMap lookup rely on String hash collisions, where crafted strings with identical hashes could cause symbol confusion and incorrect Move bytecode generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Vector length overflow] Can pushing strings to pool.strings cause Vec::len() to overflow usize::MAX, leading to incorrect symbol index assignment where new_sym wraps to 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Rc cycle] Could repeated calls with the same string cause Rc reference count overflow, or create reference cycles that prevent memory deallocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Panic on borrow_mut] If make() is called while another mutable borrow of inner is active, will RefCell panic and crash the Move compiler/verifier, causing validator DoS during module publication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [String clone cost] Can an attacker submit Move modules with extremely long identifier names (e.g., 1GB strings) to exploit the Rc::new(s.to_string()) allocation, causing memory exhaustion during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: make()] [Unicode edge cases] Does make() properly handle Unicode strings with combining characters, null bytes, or invalid UTF-8, potentially causing symbol lookup failures or security bypasses in Move identifier validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Out-of-bounds access] Can passing a Symbol with invalid usize index (e.g., from corrupted data or different pool) cause out-of-bounds panic in strings[sym.0], crashing the validator during Move verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Cross-pool attack] If a Symbol from pool A is passed to string() of pool B, will it return wrong string or panic, potentially causing type confusion in Move bytecode where 'Coin' resolves to 'Account'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Borrow panic] Can calling string() while a mutable borrow from make() is active cause RefCell borrow panic, making validators crash during parallel Move module processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Rc clone overhead] If string() is called in hot paths with massive Rc::clone() operations, can this cause performance degradation affecting consensus timing or gas metering accuracy? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: string()] [Memory leak potential] Does the Rc::clone() in string() prevent proper deallocation if symbols are stored in long-lived data structures, causing gradual memory leaks in validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: name_already_taken()] [Inefficient lookup] Does name_already_taken() create a new Rc<String> for every check via Rc::new(s.to_string()), allowing attackers to trigger excessive allocations during Move module name validation? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: name_already_taken()] [HashMap lookup cost] Can attackers submit Move modules with names designed to cause worst-case HashMap lookup performance, degrading validator responsiveness during module publication? (Low)",
