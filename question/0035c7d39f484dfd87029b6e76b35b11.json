  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct relationships] [Key binding] Is there a cryptographic binding between DecryptPrivKey, EncryptPubKey, and DealtPubKey that prevents key substitution attacks in multi-party DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Type system] [Lack of newtype pattern] Do the simple type aliases and minimal wrapper structs allow protocol-level confusion between different key types (encryption vs dealt vs secret)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Overall design] [Replay protection] Does the key structure include any mechanism to prevent replay attacks where old DKG transcripts are resubmitted in new epochs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Network serialization] When EncryptPubKey is transmitted over the network, can bit flips or partial writes create invalid keys that cause validator nodes to crash or diverge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Byzantine validator attack] Can a Byzantine validator broadcast multiple different EncryptPubKey deserializations from the same byte array, causing honest validators to have inconsistent views of the DKG state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Empty input] What happens if try_from() receives an empty byte slice - does it fail gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Oversized input] Can an attacker provide a byte array much larger than needed, causing excessive processing or memory allocation during deserialization? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Maximum value] What happens if generate() produces a scalar equal to the field modulus minus one - are there any edge cases in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Generic bounds] [Future-proofing] If Aptos needs to migrate to a different elliptic curve pairing in the future, does the generic Pairing bound allow smooth transition, or will there be security gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [Version handling] Does the empty AIP_80_PREFIX (line 25) prevent protocol versioning, making it impossible to upgrade the key format without a hard fork? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/keys.rs] [Struct: DecryptPrivKey] [Memory layout] Does the compiler optimize away zeroization of the secret key dk, or can the SilentDebug/SilentDisplay macros inadvertently expose key material? (Medium)",
