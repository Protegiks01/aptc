  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Edge case] [Zero timeout] Can timeout configurations be set to zero causing immediate TimedOut errors for all RPCs, effectively disabling RPC functionality and halting consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Edge case] [Max pending = 0] If max_concurrent_rpcs is configured to 0, will TooManyPending reject all requests immediately, creating a denial of service condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Edge case] [Invalid PeerId] When NotConnected(PeerId) contains an invalid or corrupted PeerId, can this cause panics or undefined behavior when the error is handled, logged, or used for peer management? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Edge case] [Error in error handler] If error handling code itself encounters errors (e.g., logging failures, metrics update failures), can this cause recursive error scenarios or error handling deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Monitoring] [Error rate threshold] Are there monitoring alerts for abnormal RpcError rates (e.g., spike in TimedOut or TooManyPending), or can sustained error conditions go unnoticed until consensus fails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Monitoring] [Error correlation] Can error patterns be correlated across validators to detect coordinated Byzantine attacks (e.g., multiple validators simultaneously reporting NotConnected for the same honest peer)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/rpc/error.rs] [Monitoring] [Error budgets] Are there error budgets per peer/protocol that trigger automatic mitigation (rate limiting, temporary bans) when exceeded, or will misbehaving peers continue disrupting the network indefinitely? (Medium)"
