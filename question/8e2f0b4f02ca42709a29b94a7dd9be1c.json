  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_view_functions()] [Transaction args bypass] Line 694 calls check_transaction_args but view functions shouldn't accept some transaction argument types - is there a more restrictive check needed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_view_functions()] [Return count validation] Line 695 requires return_count > 0, but can attackers create view functions that return empty vectors or unit-like values that provide no actual data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_view_functions()] [Mutable reference bypass] Line 718 only checks immutable references to signer - are mutable references to other types properly validated, or can they cause state modifications in view functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_view_functions()] [Reference mutability confusion] The check distinguishes between mutable and immutable at line 718 - can attackers cast references or use unsafe code to convert immutable to mutable within the function body? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_events()] [Inline function bypass] Line 768 skips inline and native functions - can attackers mark event-emitting functions as inline to bypass event validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_events()] [Bytecode manipulation] The code generates stackless bytecode at line 772 - can attackers manipulate bytecode between compilation stages to inject emit calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_emit_event_call()] [Module ID spoofing] Line 810 checks if the event struct is defined in the current module - can attackers use module re-exports or type aliases to emit events from other modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_emit_event_call()] [Type parameter injection] Line 804 extracts type_inst[0] assuming a single type parameter - what if emit is called with multiple type parameters or zero type parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_emit_event_call()] [Function name spoofing] The is_function check at line 800 compares full names - can attackers create a function with bytecode name '0x1::event::emit' in a different module? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_emit_event_call()] [Attribute requirement bypass] Line 812 checks for EVENT_STRUCT_ATTRIBUTE - can attackers emit events for structs where the attribute was added after module validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_events()] [Operation pattern matching] Line 777 specifically matches Operation::Function - can attackers use Operation::Pack, Operation::Unpack, or other operations to indirectly trigger event emissions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Error category module bypass] The check at line 833 skips the error category module - can attackers deploy the error module to override error mappings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Prefix collision] Line 839 checks for ERROR_PREFIX 'E' - can attackers define constants starting with 'E' that aren't error codes to pollute the error map? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Duplicate error code] The add_module_error call at line 842 may return errors that are ignored - can attackers define duplicate error codes to cause confusion in error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_abort_code()] [Integer conversion overflow] Line 862 uses u64::try_from on a BigInt - can attackers define error constants larger than u64::MAX that fail conversion and are silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: build_error_map()] [Documentation injection] Line 847 includes get_doc() in error descriptions - can attackers inject malicious HTML/JavaScript in documentation comments that execute when error messages are displayed?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: has_attribute()] [Iterator exhaustion] Lines 881-887 use an iterator that could be exhausted by prior calls - can state from previous attribute checks affect subsequent checks? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: is_function()] [Name collision vulnerability] Line 909 compares full names with addresses - can two functions with identical names at different addresses cause confusion in validation logic? (Medium)",
