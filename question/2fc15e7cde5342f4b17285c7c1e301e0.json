  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Formal Verification] [Invariant Proof] Has it been formally verified that code_invariant_error() is only called in truly impossible states, or could some call sites be reachable through adversarial inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Operations] [Log Monitoring] Do validators have alerting configured for println! output from code_invariant_error(), or can invariant violations go unnoticed until they cause consensus failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Operations] [Incident Response] When code_invariant_error() is triggered in production, is there a runbook for determining if it's an exploit versus a bug, and responding appropriately? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Operations] [Telemetry] Are metrics collected on the frequency of code_invariant_error() occurrences to detect anomalous patterns indicating an ongoing attack? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Operations] [Version Skew] If different validator versions have different conditions that trigger code_invariant_error(), can this cause consensus splits during rolling upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Feature Flags] [AGGREGATOR_V2_DELAYED_FIELDS] When the delayed fields feature flag is disabled, are code_invariant_error() calls removed or can they still be triggered, causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Feature Flags] [Flag Transition] During the transition period when delayed fields are being enabled, can inconsistent flag states cause some validators to trigger code_invariant_error() while others don't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Configuration] [Debug vs Release] Does the println! in code_invariant_error() behave differently in debug vs release builds, potentially hiding issues during development? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Upgrades] [Status Code Evolution] If the DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR status code meaning changes in a protocol upgrade, can old transactions be replayed with different outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Upgrades] [Error Message Format] Are there any on-chain contracts or systems that parse the error message format from code_invariant_error()? Could message format changes break them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Upgrades] [Migration] When migrating from old error handling to code_invariant_error(), were all call sites properly audited to ensure they represent true invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Dependencies] [PartialVMError] Does the PartialVMError struct properly handle the specific characteristics of DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR, or can type confusion occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Dependencies] [StatusCode Range] Is DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR in the correct StatusCode range (2000-2999 for invariant violations), and are all range checks in other code correct? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Dependencies] [Location Undefined] When code_invariant_error() is converted to VMError, it uses Location::Undefined - can this hide the true source of the error and make exploitation harder to detect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Message] What happens if code_invariant_error() is called with an empty or whitespace-only message? Can this bypass logging or monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Nested Errors] Can expect_ok() be called on a Result containing an error that itself wraps a code_invariant_error, creating confusing double-wrapped errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Recursive Debug] Can an attacker create a type with a recursive Debug implementation that causes stack overflow when code_invariant_error() formats it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Very Long Messages] What is the maximum length of error messages that code_invariant_error() can handle? Can extremely long messages cause buffer overflows or truncation that loses critical information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Lifecycle] [Pre-Execution] If code_invariant_error() is triggered before transaction execution begins, is the transaction properly rejected or can it affect validator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Lifecycle] [Mid-Execution] When code_invariant_error() occurs mid-execution after some state changes, are all changes atomically rolled back or can partial updates persist? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Lifecycle] [Post-Execution] If code_invariant_error() happens during post-execution cleanup (e.g., event emission), can this cause events to be lost or duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Lifecycle] [Commit Phase] When code_invariant_error() occurs during the commit phase, can this leave the database in an inconsistent state requiring manual recovery? (Critical)",
