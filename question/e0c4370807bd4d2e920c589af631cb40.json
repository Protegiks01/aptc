  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::err()] [Cold Path Exploitation] The err() function is marked with #[cold] optimization hint - can this cause non-deterministic behavior in timing-sensitive consensus operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::err()] [u64 Abort Code Limits] Can the full u64 range of abort_code values be safely handled by all error handling code paths, or can extreme values cause integer overflow or parsing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::out_of_gas()] [Partial Cost Manipulation] Can a native return out_of_gas() with partial_cost values that don't accurately reflect actual work performed, enabling gas estimation attacks or accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::out_of_gas()] [Premature OOG] Can malicious natives call out_of_gas() prematurely (before exhausting gas) to cause transaction failures and deny service to legitimate users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::out_of_gas()] [State Rollback Inconsistency] When out_of_gas() is returned, is there a guarantee that all state modifications are properly rolled back, or can partial state changes persist causing corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::out_of_gas()] [Zero Partial Cost] Can natives return out_of_gas() with zero partial_cost, effectively getting free computation before the OOG condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::out_of_gas()] [Gas Balance Probing] The documentation mentions natives can get gas balance from context - can this be exploited to probe exact gas values and optimize attacks based on remaining gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Error Code Extraction] When extracting abort_code from err.all_data(), can the unwrap_or() fallback to UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR be exploited to mask actual error conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Status Code Check Bypass] The function only checks if major_status() == StatusCode::ABORTED - can other error status codes bypass this check and propagate as Err, causing incorrect error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::map_partial_vm_result_one()] [all_data() Tuple Destructuring] The function destructures 6 values from all_data() but only uses abort_code - can the ignored values contain important context that leads to incorrect error interpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Cost Charging on Abort] When converting aborted results, is the cost parameter always charged correctly, or can aborts bypass gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Function: NativeResult::map_partial_vm_result_one()] [Error Propagation] When the function returns Err(err), is the original error properly propagated with all context, or can critical information be lost causing security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Stack Underflow] Can the pop_arg! macro be called more times than arguments available, causing stack underflow and UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR that should have been caught by verifier? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Type Confusion] Can pop_arg! be used to cast arguments to incorrect types (e.g., treating a u64 as a reference), bypassing Move's type safety and causing memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Invariant Violation Masking] When pop_arg! returns UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR on None, can this mask actual verifier bugs that allowed invalid argument counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [value_as Conversion] The macro calls value_as::<$t>() - can this conversion fail in unexpected ways for complex types, causing panics or incorrect values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Argument Order Confusion] Since pop_back() reverses argument order, can native functions incorrectly use arguments, especially in functions with many similar-typed parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/natives/function.rs] [Macro: pop_arg!] [Error Handling Early Return] The macro uses early return on errors - can this leave the arguments VecDeque in an inconsistent state if multiple pop_arg! calls fail? (Low)",
