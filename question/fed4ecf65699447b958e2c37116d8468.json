  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Name Length] Are package names with excessive length (e.g., thousands of characters) rejected, or can they cause buffer overflows, path length limits, or filesystem errors that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Whitespace Handling] Can leading or trailing whitespace in the `name` parameter cause the package to be created in unexpected locations or with names that don't match developer expectations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Display Implementation] The generic `impl Display` bounds at lines 45-46 allow any type implementing Display to be passed as deps and addrs. Can an attacker pass a type with a malicious Display implementation that injects arbitrary content when formatted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker pass types to `deps` or `addrs` iterators that, when displayed, produce valid TOML syntax but represent different values than intended, causing type confusion in the manifest? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Format Trait Abuse] Can types implementing Display use their fmt() method to access global state, perform I/O operations, or trigger side effects when written to the manifest file, potentially causing unexpected security-relevant behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Lines: 51-58] [Pattern Matching] The pattern matching on `path` parameter that either uses provided path or defaults to `name` - can this logic be exploited if Some(path) is provided but `path` is an empty PathBuf, causing undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Line: 59] [SourcePackageLayout::Sources] Does `SourcePackageLayout::Sources.path()` return a validated relative path, or could it be manipulated through environment variables or other means to point to unexpected locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Line: 60] [SourcePackageLayout::Manifest] Similarly, does `SourcePackageLayout::Manifest.path()` return 'Move.toml', and is this constant string immune to manipulation or path traversal? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Lines: 69-71] [Dependency Loop] Can the `deps` iterator be infinite or circular, causing the writeln! loop to write endlessly and fill up disk space or exhaust system resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Lines: 78-80] [Address Loop] Similarly, can the `addrs` iterator be infinite, causing excessive disk writes or resource exhaustion when writing address mappings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Lines: 81-83] [Custom Section] The `custom` parameter is written with no validation or size limits. Can an extremely large custom string (gigabytes) cause disk space exhaustion or memory exhaustion when the file is later read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Line: 82] [Empty Check] The check `if !custom.is_empty()` prevents writing empty custom strings, but can whitespace-only strings pass through and create unnecessary blank sections in the manifest? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Sources Directory] Only the sources directory is created at line 59. Can an attacker exploit the fact that no .move files are created, causing developers to unknowingly work with incomplete package structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Build Directory] No build/ or scripts/ directories are created. Can this cause issues where malicious packages include pre-existing build artifacts or scripts that get executed unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Hidden Files] Can an attacker pre-create hidden files (e.g., .git/, .cargo/) in the target directory before running `move new`, causing the command to appear successful but actually create a package with malicious hidden content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Struct: New] [Clap Parser] The struct derives Parser from clap at line 23. Are the clap parsing rules secure against command injection or argument smuggling attacks through the `name` field? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Struct: New] [Public Field] The `name` field is public at line 27. Can external code modify this field after construction but before execute() is called, bypassing any validation that might exist at construction time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [TOML Bomb] Can an attacker craft inputs that, when written to Move.toml, create a 'TOML bomb' (deeply nested structures or circular references) that causes excessive CPU or memory usage when the manifest is parsed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [TOML Parser Exploit] Can injected TOML content exploit vulnerabilities in downstream TOML parsers (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows) when the created Move.toml file is later parsed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Section Duplication] Can an attacker inject duplicate [package], [dependencies], or [addresses] sections through the custom parameter, causing ambiguity or allowing later sections to override earlier secure values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Table Injection] Can TOML table syntax ([[table]]) be injected to create arrays of tables that confuse the package manager or cause unexpected dependency resolution behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Build Hook Injection] Can injected TOML content through the `custom` parameter add build hooks, pre-build scripts, or post-build commands that execute arbitrary code during package compilation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Compiler Flag Injection] Can malicious custom TOML sections inject compiler flags or linker options that disable security features (e.g., stack canaries, ASLR) in the compiled Move bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Workspace Confusion] Can an attacker inject workspace-related TOML sections that cause the newly created package to be treated as part of a malicious workspace, inheriting dangerous dependencies or configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Windows Path Separator] Can an attacker use Windows-style path separators (\\\\) in `name` on Unix systems or vice versa to create packages in unexpected locations due to path interpretation differences? (Medium)"
