  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Orphaned event attack] Can events be emitted without corresponding on-chain state changes, creating ghost cancellations that confuse off-chain applications about actual offer status? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [State rollback vulnerability] During transaction aborts or block reorganizations, are events properly rolled back, or could finalized events reference reverted state leading to double-cancellations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Concurrent cancel exploit] Can multiple cancellation events for the same offer be emitted in parallel transactions within Block-STM parallel execution, bypassing single-cancellation invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Event-state divergence] If the event claims cancellation of amount X but on-chain state only removes amount Y (Y<X), could this discrepancy enable partial cancellation exploits or accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Module: token_transfers] [Unauthorized emission] Can contracts other than the official token_transfers module at TOKEN_ADDRESS emit TokenCancelOfferEvents that appear legitimate but represent fake cancellations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Module: token_transfers] [Event handle hijacking] If event handles can be moved or copied between accounts, could an attacker emit cancel events from a victim's event handle, making it appear the victim cancelled offers they still want active? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Module: token_transfers] [Emission order manipulation] Can the order of event emissions be manipulated within a transaction to create a different narrative than what actually occurred (e.g., claim cancellation before offer creation)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Reentrancy via events] If event emission triggers callbacks to other contracts that can re-enter the token_transfers module, could recursive cancellations exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Cross-contract event forgery] Can a malicious contract create a fake token_transfers module and emit events with identical structure but different security guarantees, confusing applications that trust events by type alone? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Delegate call attack] If TokenCancelOfferEvent is processed in the context of delegate calls or module upgrades, could the execution context be manipulated to emit events with incorrect permissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Import: TokenId] [Type re-export vulnerability] Since TokenId is imported from account_config which re-exports from events modules, could circular dependencies or stale imports cause type confusion between different versions of TokenId? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Import: MoveEventV1Type] [Version mixing attack] Can events implementing both MoveEventV1Type and MoveEventV2Type coexist, and if so, could processing path confusion allow events to bypass version-specific security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Constant: MODULE_NAME] [Identifier injection] Does the ident_str! macro properly sanitize 'token_transfers', or could macro expansion bugs allow identifier injection that breaks module resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Constant: STRUCT_NAME] [Name collision with framework] If the Aptos framework reserves certain struct names, could 'TokenCancelOfferEvent' conflict with future framework types causing upgrade failures or event routing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Fee bypass] Can cancel offer events be emitted without paying appropriate cancellation fees by manipulating the amount field or exploiting gas refund mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [MEV extraction] Could validators or MEV bots front-run cancel offer events by observing mempool transactions and cancelling offers themselves to capture arbitrage opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Batch cancellation exploit] Can emitting multiple cancel events in a single transaction reduce per-event costs compared to individual transactions, enabling spam or creating unfair economic advantages? (Low)"
