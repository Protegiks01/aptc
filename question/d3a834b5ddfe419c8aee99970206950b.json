  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Function: extra_config()] [Config inconsistency] Can different validators see different extra_config values for the same payload due to serialization/deserialization inconsistencies, causing execution divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Function: extra_config()] [Reference lifetime] Since extra_config() returns a reference, can modifications through mutable access elsewhere invalidate this reference and cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Function: is_encrypted()] [Logic error] Does is_encrypted() only check for Encrypted variant but not FailedDecryption, potentially allowing failed decryptions to be treated as still encrypted and reprocessed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Function: is_encrypted()] [State confusion] Can transaction processing logic rely on is_encrypted() incorrectly, treating FailedDecryption as successfully decrypted, leading to invalid transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Deserialization bomb] Can a crafted serialized payload cause exponential memory allocation during deserialization, leading to DoS attacks on validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Type confusion] Can deserializing untrusted data create EncryptedPayload instances with invalid internal state that violate type invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Attribute: serde_bytes] [Byte vector attack] Does serde_bytes deserialization validate that ciphertext and eval_proof contain valid bytes, or can malformed data cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Version compatibility] Can deserialization fail when validators run different versions, causing consensus failures or chain splits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Canonical encoding] Is there a unique canonical serialization for each EncryptedPayload, or can multiple serializations of the same logical payload cause hash mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Hash] [Hash consistency] Can the derived Hash implementation produce different hashes for semantically equal payloads across different Rust compiler versions or platforms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Eq, PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Can two EncryptedPayload instances be unequal according to PartialEq but have the same hash, breaking HashMap/HashSet invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Hash] [Hash collision] Does hashing large ciphertext or eval_proof fields increase collision probability, potentially allowing attackers to substitute transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Eq] [NaN floating point] If TransactionExecutable contains floating point values, can NaN comparisons break equality checks and cause consensus divergence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone verification] Does Clone properly deep-copy all nested structures in TransactionExecutable, or can shared references lead to unintended mutations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Clone cost] Can cloning large EncryptedPayload instances (with megabyte ciphertexts) cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion in consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [State: Encrypted -> Decrypted] [Transition validation] Is there atomic validation when transitioning from Encrypted to Decrypted state, or can partial state changes cause inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [State: Encrypted -> FailedDecryption] [Failure verification] Can a validator maliciously claim decryption failed (FailedDecryption) for a valid encrypted transaction to censor it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [State: Decrypted] [State immutability] Once in Decrypted state, can the payload be reverted to Encrypted state, potentially allowing re-encryption attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Field: decryption_nonce] [Nonce overflow] Can decryption_nonce (u64) overflow if a single transaction is decrypted multiple times, wrapping around and enabling replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/encrypted_payload.rs] [Field: decryption_nonce] [Nonce uniqueness] Is decryption_nonce guaranteed to be unique across all transactions, or can nonce collisions allow transaction substitution? (Critical)",
