  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker exploit the path handling to load arbitrary files outside the intended config directory by passing paths with '../' sequences, potentially exposing sensitive validator keys or system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: load_config()] [Symlink Attack] Does load_config() follow symbolic links without validation, allowing an attacker to create symlinks pointing to sensitive files (like private keys in safety rules storage) and read them through config loading? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Symlink Race] Is there a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerability where an attacker replaces the target file with a symlink between path validation and file write, causing configs to overwrite unintended files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: read_config_file()] [Path Injection] Does the unwrap() call on to_str() at line 33 allow attackers to cause validator crashes by providing paths with non-UTF8 characters, leading to loss of liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Path Injection] Can the unwrap() on to_str() at lines 45 and 47 be exploited to crash validators during config save operations, causing service disruption during critical epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Directory Traversal] Does File::create() at line 44 create parent directories if they don't exist, and can this be exploited to create malicious directory structures or overwrite existing directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to save_config() for SafetyRulesConfig from multiple threads cause data corruption or partial writes, leading to invalid safety data that breaks consensus safety guarantees?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [Missing Fsync] Does write_file() call fsync() after write_all() to ensure data is persisted to disk, or can power failures cause loss of recently saved SafetyRulesConfig data leading to safety rule violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: write_file()] [No Temp File Pattern] Does write_file() use a temporary file with atomic rename pattern, or does it write directly to the target allowing crashes mid-write to corrupt critical NodeConfig/SafetyRulesConfig files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/persistable_config.rs] [Function: save_config()] [No Checksum Validation] Does save_config() write checksums or use any integrity verification, or can bit flips or storage corruption cause validators to load invalid configs leading to consensus failures?
