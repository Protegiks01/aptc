  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: failure_rate()] [Division by zero] Can an attacker craft a scenario where both proposal_failures and proposal_successes are zero, causing division by zero (0/0) which produces NaN, potentially breaking downstream logic that relies on numeric comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: failure_rate()] [Integer overflow] Can proposal_failures + proposal_successes overflow u32::MAX when cast to f32, causing incorrect failure rate calculations that misclassify malicious validators as reliable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: failure_rate()] [Type conversion] Does the f32 cast lose precision for large proposal counts, potentially causing a validator with exactly 10% failure rate to be misclassified due to floating point rounding errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: failure_rate()] [NaN propagation] If failure_rate() returns NaN due to 0/0, does this NaN value propagate through is_reliable() and downstream analysis, potentially causing silent failures or incorrect validator state categorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_reliable()] [Logic error] Can a validator with exactly proposal_successes=1 and proposal_failures=0 be marked as reliable even if they only participated in a single round, potentially allowing gaming of validator selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_reliable()] [Threshold manipulation] Is the 0.1 (10%) failure threshold hardcoded without governance control, allowing validators to consistently fail 9.9% of proposals without penalty? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_reliable()] [Comparison with NaN] If failure_rate() returns NaN, does the comparison 'failure_rate() < 0.1' always return false, incorrectly marking all validators with zero proposals as unreliable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_voting_enough()] [Integer overflow] Can rounds parameter overflow when multiplied by 0.3 and cast to f32, causing incorrect vote threshold calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_voting_enough()] [Threshold gaming] Can a validator vote in exactly 30% of rounds to pass the threshold while minimizing participation, effectively freeloading on rewards without contributing to consensus security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: is_voting_enough()] [Zero rounds edge case] If rounds=0, does the comparison 'votes > 0.0' always succeed regardless of actual votes, incorrectly marking validators as voting enough? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: to_order_weight()] [Logic inconsistency] Why does NodeState::Absent have weight=1 (best) while NodeState::Reliable has weight=0, creating counterintuitive ordering where absent validators sort better than unreliable ones? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: to_order_weight()] [Weight manipulation] Can the large gaps between weight values (0, 100, 10000, 1000000, 100000000) cause integer overflow in aggregate calculations used for sorting validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Impl: Add for ValidatorStats] [Integer overflow] Can proposal_successes overflow u32::MAX when adding two ValidatorStats, silently wrapping and producing incorrect aggregate statistics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Impl: Add for ValidatorStats] [Integer overflow] Can proposal_failures overflow u32::MAX during addition, causing a malicious validator's failure count to wrap around and appear successful? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Impl: Add for ValidatorStats] [Integer overflow] Can votes overflow u32::MAX when aggregating across epochs, losing vote count data and affecting validator reputation tracking? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Impl: Add for ValidatorStats] [Data loss] Why is voting_power set to 0 in Add implementation instead of being aggregated, causing loss of critical staking information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: to_state()] [Logic error] Can a validator with zero proposals but non-zero votes be incorrectly classified as OnlyVoting instead of NotParticipatingInConsensus if proposal data is missing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: to_state()] [Default state] Does returning NodeState::Absent when validator_stats doesn't contain a validator hide potential data corruption where validators should be present? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/analyze/analyze_validators.rs] [Function: to_state()] [State inconsistency] Can race conditions cause a validator to have proposal_successes > 0 but is_reliable() = false simultaneously, leading to inconsistent AliveUnreliable classification? (Low)",
