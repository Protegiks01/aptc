  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: length()] [Length tampering] Can the table.length field be modified through direct storage manipulation outside the Move VM, causing it to diverge from the actual table size and making consensus read wrong number of events during recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [Table deletion] Can the entire table referenced by table_handle be deleted from storage while CommitHistoryResource metadata remains, causing all consensus recovery attempts to fail with 'Resource doesn't exist' errors and permanent liveness loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [BCS compatibility] Does the Rust struct definition exactly match the Move struct layout, or can field ordering/padding differences cause BCS deserialization to swap max_capacity and next_idx values, breaking circular buffer logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [Nested deserialization] When deserializing TableWithLength, can malformed BCS encoding cause the handle and length fields to be misaligned, resulting in handle containing part of length data and vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Backwards compatibility] If the Move-side struct adds new fields in future upgrades, will old Rust code fail to deserialize the resource, or will it silently ignore new fields potentially missing critical security-related information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [Field ordering] Are the struct fields in the same order as the Move definition (max_capacity, next_idx, table), and can BCS deserialization succeed even with different ordering, leading to fields being assigned wrong values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [U64 endianness] Does BCS handle table.length (u64) consistently across different architectures, or can big-endian vs little-endian differences cause validators on different platforms to read different length values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [OnChainConfig trait] [Type safety] Can the OnChainConfig trait's from_bytes() implementation be tricked into deserializing arbitrary binary data as CommitHistoryResource by crafting BCS bytes that pass basic validation but contain malicious values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Shallow copy] Does Clone create a deep copy of the TableHandle, or is it a shallow copy that allows multiple CommitHistoryResource instances to share the same underlying table, enabling one to modify data visible to all others? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Derive: PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Can the PartialEq implementation be exploited where two CommitHistoryResource instances compare as equal despite having different table_handles pointing to different tables with different events, causing consensus to treat distinct histories as identical? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leak] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information (e.g., TableHandle internal structure, next_idx patterns) that could help attackers predict future state and craft targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Derive: Eq] [Hash collisions] If CommitHistoryResource is used in HashMaps/HashSets, can hash collisions cause different resources to be treated as identical, leading to consensus using wrong commit history during recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [Zero capacity] If max_capacity is initialized to 0 through malicious genesis or initialize_commit_history bypass, will all subsequent block commits fail when attempting modulo by zero, permanently halting the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: next_idx()] [Maximum value] When next_idx reaches u32::MAX, does the modulo operation in Move (idx + 1) % max_capacity correctly wrap around, or can overflow occur if max_capacity is u32::MAX causing next_idx to remain stuck at u32::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [Empty table] Can table.length be 0 while next_idx > 0, indicating all events were deleted but next_idx wasn't reset, causing consensus to calculate indices for non-existent events and fail during recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: length()] [Maximum length] If table.length reaches u64::MAX, can it overflow on the next increment, wrapping to 0 and making consensus think the table is empty when it's actually full, skipping recovery from historical events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [Single capacity] If max_capacity=1, does the circular buffer logic work correctly, or will it continuously overwrite the same slot making it impossible to store any commit history and breaking all consensus recovery scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: max_capacity()] [Type boundary] At exactly u32::MAX max_capacity, can the modulo calculation '(idx + 1) % max_capacity' overflow before the modulo is applied, causing next_idx to become 0 unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [Length overflow] Can table.length exceed the actual storage capacity, causing validators with limited storage to fail when consensus attempts to read all 'resource.length()' events during recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [Concurrent reads] When multiple consensus threads simultaneously call get_latest_k_committed_events(), can they read inconsistent values of next_idx and length if a block commit happens between reading these fields, causing different validators to fetch different event sets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: next_idx()] [Read-modify-write race] Is there a race condition where consensus reads next_idx, then a new block is committed incrementing next_idx, and consensus calculates indices based on the stale value, reading one event ahead or behind the intended position? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: TableWithLength] [Length race] Can table.length be incremented by one block commit while consensus is iterating through events, causing the loop 'for i in 1..=std::cmp::min(k, resource.length())' to fetch one extra event that wasn't intended? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Method: table_handle()] [Handle invalidation] If CommitHistoryResource is replaced entirely during a governance upgrade, can consensus hold a reference to the old table_handle and continue reading stale events while new blocks write to a different table? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [OnChainConfig trait] [Identifier mismatch] If MODULE_IDENTIFIER or TYPE_IDENTIFIER don't exactly match the Move module path, will get_state_value_by_version fail to find the resource, or will it find a different resource with malicious data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/commit_history.rs] [Struct: CommitHistoryResource] [Move assumption violation] Does the Rust code assume the Move emit_new_block_event() always increments next_idx atomically with table writes, and can this assumption be violated through direct state manipulation causing permanent desync? (Critical)"
