  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: CompilationEnv::add_diag()] [Diagnostic flooding] Can an attacker cause the compiler to generate millions of diagnostics by providing intentionally broken code, causing memory exhaustion and validator DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: CompilationEnv::has_errors()] [Severity threshold bypass] Does has_errors() correctly classify all error severities, or can NonblockingError be exploited to allow compilation of invalid code that should fail? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: CompilationEnv::check_diags_at_or_above_severity()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to this function combined with std::mem::take() cause diagnostics to be lost or duplicated across parallel compilation threads? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: CompilationEnv::take_final_warning_diags()] [Debug assertion bypass] The debug_assert can be disabled in release builds - can this allow critical errors to be misclassified as warnings and ignored in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Struct: CompilationEnv] [State inconsistency] Can the flags, diags, and known_attributes get out of sync during multi-phase compilation causing non-deterministic behavior across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: CompilationEnv::get_known_attributes()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Can the known_attributes set be modified between check and use, allowing time-of-check-time-of-use attacks where unknown attributes pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Counter::next()] [Overflow wrap-around] When COUNTER_NEXT reaches usize::MAX, does fetch_add wrap to 0, potentially causing counter collisions that break unique identifier guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Counter::next()] [Return type truncation] The function returns u64 but uses AtomicUsize internally - on 128-bit systems, can this truncate high bits causing counter collisions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Counter::next()] [Ordering vulnerabilities] Does AcqRel ordering provide sufficient synchronization, or can weaker orderings in other code cause counter reordering leading to duplicate IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Static: COUNTER_NEXT] [Global state pollution] Since this is a static global counter, can malicious compilation requests intentionally consume counter space to cause exhaustion for legitimate transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Counter::next()] [Race condition exploitation] Can extremely high-frequency parallel calls to Counter::next() exploit cache coherency issues in fetch_add to produce duplicate values? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Struct: Flags] [Test mode privilege escalation] Can an attacker set the test flag to true in production builds, enabling #[test_only] functions that should not be accessible? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Flags::verification()] [Shadow flag security bypass] Does setting shadow=true in verification mode allow malicious code to override framework code with identically-named modules? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/shared/mod.rs] [Function: Flags::skip_attribute_checks()] [Attribute validation bypass] Can setting skip_attribute_checks=true disable all attribute validation, allowing malicious attributes that enable privilege escalation?
