  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/observer_message.rs] [Function: verify_ordered_blocks()] [Consensus bypass] Can an attacker send an empty blocks vector to bypass block validation checks, causing the observer to accept invalid consensus state without any blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/observer_message.rs] [Function: verify_ordered_blocks()] [Safety violation] Can an attacker craft an OrderedBlock where the last block ID doesn't match the ordered proof ID by exploiting hash collision vulnerabilities, allowing acceptance of malicious blocks that don't match the proof?
