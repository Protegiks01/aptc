(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/public_parameters.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Parameter tampering] Are the skipped fields 'table' and 'powers_of_radix' vulnerable to desync attacks where an attacker provides valid serialized parameters but the rebuilt computed fields differ from the original, causing inconsistent discrete log computations across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/public_parameters.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a PublicParameters instance with an extremely large 'ell' value (up to 255) that causes the 'table' HashMap to allocate excessive memory (2^(ell/2) entries), leading to OOM crashes during deserialization and DoS on validator nodes?
