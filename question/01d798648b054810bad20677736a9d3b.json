  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Error propagation] All error handling uses the ? operator - if an error occurs deep in iteration, does the cleanup properly occur, or could partial validation state be left that affects subsequent runs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Result unwrapping] The res? at line 38 propagates errors from the iterator - but are these errors distinguishing between real corruption, missing data, and transient database issues, or could transient errors be misinterpreted as corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Arc safety] The ledger_db is wrapped in Arc at line 26 - if multiple validation tasks run concurrently using the same Arc reference, could database connection pooling or lock contention cause race conditions in validation results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Shared state] Does the Arc<LedgerDB> at line 26 properly isolate read operations from concurrent writes by other processes, or could write locks be acquired during iteration causing deadlocks or stale reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Ensure condition] The ensure! macro at line 45-51 checks hash equality - is this the correct way to handle mismatches, or should it collect all mismatches first before failing, potentially missing multiple corruption points in one run? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Ensure failure] When ensure! fails at line 45, does it return an AptosDbError that properly indicates validation failure, or could the error type be confused with database access errors leading to incorrect diagnosis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Version count ensure] The ensure! at line 59-63 checks if all versions were validated - but the error message includes 'version' which might not be set correctly if the loop exited early, potentially causing confusing error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Hash calculation] The txn_info.hash() at line 43 computes the hash on-the-fly - if the hash calculation logic has changed between when the transaction was committed and when validation runs, could this cause false mismatch reports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Hash determinism] Is the hash() function at line 43 guaranteed to be deterministic across different Rust compiler versions, optimization levels, or CPU architectures - could non-deterministic hashing cause false positives?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Hash caching] Does txn_info.hash() at line 43 use cached hashes or recompute them - if recomputing, could this expose bugs where stored hashes differ from computed hashes due to hash function changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [DB initialization] The open_ledger_db() at line 26 may fail - is error handling adequate if the database is locked, corrupted, or in an inconsistent state from a previous crash? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Multiple DB instances] Can multiple instances of this validation tool run concurrently against the same database - if so, could this cause lock contention, resource exhaustion, or inconsistent validation results?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Metadata DB access] The metadata_db() call at line 29 accesses a sub-database - is this sub-database guaranteed to be consistent with transaction_info_db() and transaction_accumulator_db_raw(), or could they be at different commit points?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: run()] [Genesis handling] Does the validation correctly handle version 0 (genesis transaction) - could special genesis handling in either transaction_info or accumulator storage cause false mismatches?
