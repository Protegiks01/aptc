  "[File: storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/restore.rs] [Function: StateSnapshotRestoreController::run_impl()] [Add_chunk failure propagation] If add_chunk fails, does the restore properly rollback or can partial state be committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/restore.rs] [Function: StateSnapshotRestoreController::run_impl()] [Finish without all chunks] Can finish() be called before all chunks are added, creating incomplete state that appears valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/restore.rs] [Function: StateSnapshotRestoreController::run_impl()] [Run mode verification bypass] The is_verify() check affects metrics but not validation - can verify mode be bypassed allowing unvalidated restores? (High)",
  "[File: storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/restore.rs] [Function: StateSnapshotRestoreController::run_impl()] [Proof deserialization attack] The load_bcs_file for chunk proof deserializes SparseMerkleRangeProof - can malicious BCS data cause crashes or bypass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/restore.rs] [Function: StateSnapshotRestoreController::run_impl()] [Proof-data mismatch] The proof is loaded separately from blobs - can these be from different versions or chunks causing verification to pass with wrong data?
