  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Module: bulletproofs] [Range proof forgery] The bulletproofs module is exposed - can malicious actors forge range proofs that appear valid but actually hide values outside the claimed range, potentially enabling inflation attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Module: arkworks] [Serialization] The arkworks module likely provides elliptic curve operations - does the serialization of curve points properly validate canonical encoding to prevent point malleability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Module: arkworks] [Polynomial evaluation] If arkworks includes polynomial operations for ZK proofs, are there timing side-channels in polynomial evaluation that could leak secret witness values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Module: blstrs] [BLS implementation choice] The crate exposes both bls12381 and blstrs modules - could confusion between these two BLS implementations lead to using incompatible signature formats causing signature verification failures? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: traits] [Trait implementation] The traits module is re-exported with 'pub use self::traits::*' - could incorrect trait implementations in consuming code lead to cryptographic misuse, such as custom serialization breaking signature verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: once_cell] [Hidden dependency] The once_cell crate is re-exported as #[doc(hidden)] - is this used for lazy static initialization of cryptographic constants, and could race conditions in initialization lead to use of uninitialized crypto state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/lib.rs] [Re-export: serde_name] [Serialization confusion] The serde_name crate is re-exported as #[doc(hidden)] for CryptoHasher derive - could malicious serde rename attributes cause hash domain confusion enabling collision attacks? (Medium)",
