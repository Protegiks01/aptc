  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource Struct] [Type-Data Mismatch] Can the resource_type field indicate one Move type (e.g., Coin) while data contains fields from a different type, bypassing Move's type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account Struct] [Stale State] Does the REST client validate that deserialized Account data matches current blockchain state, or can attackers replay old API responses with outdated sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandle Struct] [Counter-GUID Mismatch] Can the counter field be inconsistent with the GUID's creation history, causing event stream corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [ID Struct] [Address-CreationNum Binding] Is the binding between addr and creation_num validated, or can attackers create IDs claiming creation numbers belonging to different accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Empty String] How does the function handle empty strings after trimming '0x' prefix - does it return an error or parse as zero? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_resource_type] [Empty Type String] Can parse_struct_tag handle empty strings, or does it cause panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account Struct] [Missing Fields] If JSON is missing authentication_key or sequence_number fields, does deserialization fail gracefully or accept partial data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Structs] [Extra Fields] If JSON contains unexpected extra fields, does serde silently ignore them or can they cause deserialization confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Types] [Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker serving a compromised REST API provide valid-looking but malicious data through these types to downgrade security of client applications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource Struct] [Resource Exhaustion via API] Can an attacker query endpoints that return millions of Resource objects with large data fields, exhausting memory on REST API servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account Struct] [Sequence Number Prediction] By repeatedly querying Account data, can an attacker predict sequence numbers and front-run transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandle Struct] [Event Stream Poisoning] Can manipulated EventHandle data cause clients to subscribe to wrong event streams, missing critical notifications? (High)"
