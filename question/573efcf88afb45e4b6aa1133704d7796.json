  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Struct: Context] [Uninitialized database access] Since Context uses Default trait (line 34) with Option-wrapped databases (lines 38-41), can requests access endpoints before set_aptos_db() or set_consensus_dbs() are called, causing None-dereference panics?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Trailing slash bypass] Can endpoints be accessed with trailing slashes like /debug/consensus/consensusdb/ or /debug/consensus/consensusdb// to bypass authentication or trigger different handler logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Default route exposure] Does the catch-all route at line 242 properly sanitize error messages, or can it leak information about internal routes, authentication requirements, or server configuration?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Query parameter explosion] Can an attacker send requests with thousands of query parameters to req.uri().query() at line 161, causing CPU exhaustion in url::form_urlencoded::parse or hash map operations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Async task exhaustion] Can concurrent requests spawn unbounded async tasks in the tokio runtime, exhausting the thread pool and causing the validator's admin service to become unresponsive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Request body handling] Does the function properly limit Request<Body> size, or can attackers send gigabyte-sized request bodies to exhaust memory even though most endpoints only check GET requests?
