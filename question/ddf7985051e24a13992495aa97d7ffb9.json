  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious `path` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../etc') to create directories and files outside the intended project root, potentially overwriting system files or configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] When `path` is None and defaults to `name` (line 57), can an attacker provide a `name` containing path traversal sequences like '../../../malicious/path' to escape the current directory and write files to arbitrary locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/new.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] Does `create_dir_all` at line 59 follow symbolic links, allowing an attacker to create a symlink at the target path pointing to a sensitive directory (e.g., /etc or ~/.ssh), causing the Move.toml manifest to be written to that sensitive location? (High)",
