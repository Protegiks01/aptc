  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Memory Safety] [Unwrap Chains] Do the multiple .unwrap() calls throughout the file (lines 32, 43, 54, 66, 77, 82, 92, 103, 115, 126, 137, 148, 158, 172, 182, 192, 202, 207, 217, 226, 236, 246, 255) create panic conditions that could crash validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Histogram Observation] [Floating Point] Can observe_with() calls with size as f64 (lines 284, 430) cause precision loss or floating point issues affecting metric accuracy for very large values? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Determinism] [Consensus Impact] If metric collection timing or side effects introduce non-determinism in transaction processing, could this cause validators to produce different state roots breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Error Counter] [Monotonicity] Does EXECUTOR_ERRORS counter (line 80-82) monotonically increase, or can counter resets hide cumulative error patterns from long-term monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Timing Metrics] [Side Channel] Can timing histograms (EXECUTE_CHUNK, APPLY_CHUNK, COMMIT_CHUNK, etc.) leak information about transaction content or execution paths that could be exploited for side-channel attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Label Values] [Sanitization] Are label values sanitized before being passed to Prometheus metrics to prevent injection attacks or metric namespace pollution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [Exponential Buckets] [Configuration] Can the exponential bucket configuration (start=1e-3, factor=2.0, count=20-25) cause histogram memory usage to grow unexpectedly under specific transaction patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [String Formatting] [DoS] Can format! macro calls (lines 310, 341, 401, 411) with untrusted input cause excessive string allocation or formatting panics affecting validator stability? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/metrics.rs] [CORE_CODE_ADDRESS Constant] [Hard-coded Value] Is CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (lines 20, 460, 492) properly validated and immutable, or can it be modified through configuration attacks to misclassify core vs user transactions? (Medium)",
