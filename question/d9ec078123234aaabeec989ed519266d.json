  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Constant: INITIAL_SIZE] [Inadequate capacity] The initial buffer size of 1024 may be too small for real-world workloads - can an attacker force immediate reallocation on the first intern operation by submitting large Move modules, causing performance degradation during consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Memory retention] The flush() function clears containers but doesn't shrink their capacity - can repeated flush/intern cycles cause memory fragmentation or prevent memory from being returned to the OS, gradually degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Clone amplification] If T has an expensive Clone implementation, can an attacker exploit the clone operation at line 148 to amplify resource consumption, especially during the period when the value must be converted from Cow::Borrowed to Cow::Owned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: ConcurrentBTreeInterner] [BTreeMap overhead] BTreeMap has O(log n) insert/lookup complexity - can an attacker deliberately create worst-case BTreeMap behavior patterns (unbalanced tree) by interning values in specific orders, causing transaction validation slowdowns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Lock contention amplification] The expensive clone operation outside the lock at line 148 followed by reacquisition of the write lock can cause lock contention - can this be exploited to create a thundering herd problem during parallel execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Trait bound: Ord] [Ord implementation attack] If T implements Ord maliciously or inconsistently, can this cause BTreeMap operations to violate internal invariants, leading to incorrect lookup results that break Move type resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Trait bound: Clone] [Panicking Clone] Can a type with a panicking Clone implementation be used with the interner, and would such panics during intern_deferred() at line 148 poison the write lock or leave the interner in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Type alignment] Does the unsafe code properly account for type alignment requirements? Can unaligned access to T values stored in the buffer cause undefined behavior on certain architectures running validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Lifetime: 'static] [Lifetime extension] The 'static lifetime on interned values is a lie - can this be exploited through type system tricks or lifetime extension to access freed memory, especially in generic contexts where T might contain references? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Cow pattern safety] The Cow::Borrowed to Cow::Owned conversion assumes the borrowed reference is valid during the conversion - can the borrowed reference be invalidated if it points to memory owned by another interner that gets flushed concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Map-vec sync] If the map.insert at line 161 fails (e.g., OOM), but vec.push at line 159 succeeded, can this leave map and vec in inconsistent states causing subsequent lookups to return incorrect indices or None? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Partial flush] If flush() panics midway through (e.g., during map.clear()), can some data structures be cleared while others remain populated, causing state inconsistency that breaks Move VM identifier resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Duplicate detection failure] If two equal values have different memory representations or hash differently due to padding, can they both be interned with different indices, violating the uniqueness invariant and causing type confusion in Move bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Struct: InternerPool] [next_size invariant] After flush(), next_size is not reset - can this cause unexpected behavior where a flushed interner immediately allocates huge buffers on the first intern, wasting memory and affecting validator resource management? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Inconsistent empty state] Can is_empty() return true while the pool still contains allocated buffers, or vice versa, causing incorrect assumptions in calling code about resource usage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Index stability] If vec is reallocated during push operation, are all previously returned indices still valid, or can reallocation cause index invalidation that breaks cached references in Move VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern()] [Module identifier pollution] Can an attacker submit Move transactions with maliciously crafted module names designed to maximize interner memory usage (e.g., many unique long identifiers), causing validator OOM during transaction validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern()] [Type name collision] If the Move VM uses this interner for type names, can an attacker craft types that hash to the same BTreeMap position but are different, causing one type to be returned for another and violating Move's type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: lookup()] [Bytecode verification bypass] Can stale indices from a previous VM session be used after flush() to access different values, allowing bytecode to reference wrong types or functions and bypass Move's verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Gas accounting bypass] If interning is not properly gas-metered, can an attacker submit transactions that intern many values for free, exhausting validator resources without paying gas costs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: flush()] [Epoch transition corruption] If flush() is called during an epoch transition while transactions are still being validated using old indices, can this cause validators to disagree on transaction validity, leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern()] [Struct name injection] Can an attacker intern malicious struct names that match system structs (e.g., 'Coin', 'Account') to cause confusion during Move bytecode interpretation, potentially allowing unauthorized resource access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: intern_deferred()] [Determinism violation] Are BTreeMap operations deterministic across all validator implementations and compiler versions? Can subtle differences in Ord implementation or BTreeMap internals cause different validators to assign different indices to the same value? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: lookup()] [Cache timing attack] Can the time taken for lookup() operations leak information about previously interned values through timing side channels, allowing attackers to infer private transaction data from validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/interner.rs] [Function: alloc()] [Expect panic] The expect() call on self.buffer.last() at line 92 will panic if the buffer is somehow empty after push - can this panic condition be triggered through race conditions or memory corruption, causing validator crashes? (Medium)"
