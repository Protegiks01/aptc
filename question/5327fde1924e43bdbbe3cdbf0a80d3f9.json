  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_metadata_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Iterator Drop] When the function returns (lines 72), are the iterators properly dropped and their resources released, or can iterator leaks accumulate over many pruning cycles causing resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_metadata_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Batch Drop] If the function returns early due to error (via '?' operator), is the SchemaBatch properly dropped without side effects, or can partial batches cause resource leaks or database inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_metadata_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Comparison Direction] The condition 'index.stale_since_version > target_version' (lines 46, 59) breaks the loop for entries newer than target. Is this correct, or should it be '>=' to ensure entries at exactly target_version are also skipped? What is the semantic meaning of stale_since_version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/state_kv_pruner/state_kv_metadata_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Inclusive/Exclusive Range] Based on the break condition (lines 47, 60), the pruning range appears to be [current_progress, target_version]. Is this the intended range, or should it be exclusive on one or both ends to avoid off-by-one errors? (Medium)"
