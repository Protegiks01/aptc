  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Git URL Injection] For SourceLocation::Git (line 210), the git_url is expected from user_provided_url - can an attacker inject command arguments or special characters in the URL that get executed during git operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Commit ID Validation] Is the commit_id properly validated as a valid git SHA, or can an attacker provide arbitrary strings that cause git command injection or checkout of unintended refs? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Subdir Path Traversal] After checking out a git repo, the function joins checkout_path with subdir (line 213) - can an attacker use path traversal in subdir (e.g., '../../../etc/passwd') to access files outside the repo? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Local Path Cloning] For SourceLocation::Local, the path is cloned directly (line 204) - are there TOCTOU vulnerabilities where the directory contents change between path resolution and actual usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Async Race Condition] Can concurrent async calls to get_package_local_path() for the same remote package cause race conditions in package_cache operations, leading to corrupted or incomplete package downloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Infinite Recursion] Although cyclic dependencies are checked later, can an attacker craft complex dependency patterns that cause infinite recursion in the resolve_package function before the cycle check occurs, leading to stack overflow? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Early Return Bypass] If a package is already in the resolved map (line 228-230), it returns immediately - can an attacker exploit this to cache a malicious package identity early and have it reused without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [OnChain TODO] The TODO comment on line 243 states 'fetch transitive deps' is not implemented - does this mean on-chain packages don't have their dependencies resolved, allowing missing or malicious transitive dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Manifest Path Validation] When reading the manifest at line 249, is there validation that manifest_path is actually within the expected directory, or can symbolic links redirect to arbitrary files? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Name Mismatch Attack] The check on line 258-264 verifies package name matches - but does this check occur after the package is added to the graph, allowing a brief window where the mismatched package is considered valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Graph Node Reuse] After adding a package to the graph (line 267-271), is the node_idx properly validated before inserting into the resolved map, or could integer overflow in NodeIndex cause aliasing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Dev Dependencies Ordering] When dev_mode is true, dev_dependencies are chained after regular dependencies (line 275-283) - can an attacker exploit this ordering to have dev dependencies override or shadow regular dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Box::pin Recursion] The recursive call to resolve_dependency uses Box::pin (line 286) - is there potential for stack exhaustion despite pinning if the dependency tree is extremely deep? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Edge Addition Atomicity] After resolving each dependency, an edge is added to the graph (line 298) - are these operations atomic, or can concurrent modifications corrupt the graph structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_package()] [Error Handling] If resolve_dependency fails partway through the dependency list (line 286-297), is the graph left in a partially constructed state that could be reused incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [URL Lifetime] The remote_url variable is declared outside the match block to extend its lifetime (line 322) - could this lead to use-after-free or dangling reference issues in async contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Absolute Path in Local Dep] For local dependencies of local parents (line 329-332), if local_path is absolute, it's used directly - can an attacker use absolute paths to escape the package directory hierarchy and reference system files?

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Git Local Dependency] For git parent with local child (line 351-384), the subdir is joined with local_path - but is there validation that the resulting path doesn't use '..' to escape the repo root despite the check on line 368-372? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Absolute Path Rejection] Line 359-364 rejects absolute paths for local dependencies in git repos - but does this check handle Windows-style absolute paths (C:\\\\) or UNC paths (\\\\\\\\server\\\\share) correctly?

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve_dependency()] [Parent Dir Component Check] The check for ParentDir component (line 368-372) only looks at the first component - can an attacker use paths like 'a/b/../../../etc' that have parent dir components later?
