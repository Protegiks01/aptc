  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [All Weight Functions] [Underflow Risk] Are there any scenarios where weight subtraction could underflow (weights are usize, so no negative values, but could cause wrap-around)? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Concurrent Reconstruction] Can multiple threads call reconstruct() simultaneously on the same WeightedConfig? Could this cause race conditions in share processing or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [All Functions] [Interior Mutability] Does any interior mutability pattern (Cell, RefCell, etc.) exist that could bypass Rust's borrowing rules and allow concurrent mutation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Threshold Security] Can threshold_weight be set to 1 in a large validator set (e.g., 100 validators), completely eliminating Byzantine fault tolerance and allowing any single validator to reconstruct secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Weight Distribution] If one player has weight = W-1 and threshold = W-1, can that single player reconstruct the secret alone, centralizing trust and violating distributed security assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Byzantine Threshold] Does the code enforce that threshold_weight > (total_weight / 3) to maintain Byzantine fault tolerance, or can attackers create vulnerable configurations? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_batch_evaluation_domain()] [Reference Lifetime] Are the returned references to evaluation domains safe to use across async operations? Could they be invalidated causing use-after-free? (Medium)",
