  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Error Handling] [Type Conversion Failure] If type_to_type_tag() fails, does it return a proper error or can it panic, and are all failure modes handled correctly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Error Handling] [Abort Code Consistency] The abort code NFE_EXPECTED_STRUCT_TYPE_TAG - is this abort code unique and correctly handled by the Move VM, or can it conflict with other errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Error Handling] [Extension Missing] If NativeTransactionContext extension is missing, does extensions().get() panic, return None, or handle it gracefully? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Empty Type Arguments] What happens if struct_tag.type_args is empty - does the function correctly handle structs with no generic parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Special Characters in Names] Can struct or module names contain characters that require escaping in to_canonical_string(), and are they handled correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Zero-Length Strings] Can zero-length module or struct names cause issues in vector_u8() construction or Move string handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Maximum Type Nesting] Is there a maximum nesting depth for type parameters enforced, or can arbitrary nesting cause stack overflow or exponential complexity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Primitive Types] What happens if someone calls type_of<u64>() or other primitive types - is the abort code correctly triggered? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Edge Cases] [Vector Types] If type_of<vector<T>>() is called, does it abort correctly since vector is not a struct, or can it cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Test Type Diversity] The test at line 154-181 only tests with vector<u8> as type argument - can other type argument combinations reveal bugs not caught by this test? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Random Address Testing] The test uses AccountAddress::random() - can this cause non-deterministic test failures if address handling has edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Gas Cost Testing] No tests verify gas charging behavior - can gas undercharging or overcharging bugs go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Error Path Testing] No tests verify error conditions (non-struct types, charge failures) - can error handling bugs remain undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Concurrent Call Testing] No tests verify behavior under concurrent native function calls - can race conditions remain undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Chain ID Testing] No tests verify native_chain_id() behavior - can chain ID handling bugs go undetected in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Testing] [Large Type Testing] No tests verify behavior with extremely large or deeply nested types - can performance or correctness issues remain hidden? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Line 24] [Write Macro First Element] The write! at line 24 handles the first type argument - can empty type_args cause this to behave unexpectedly despite the first() check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Line 25-26] [Loop Type Iteration] The skip(1) iterator - can malformed iterators or concurrent modifications cause incorrect type argument processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/type_info.rs] [Line 31-35] [Vector Order] The Struct::pack uses specific field order [address, module, name] - can field reordering in the Move struct definition cause deserialization failures? (High)",
