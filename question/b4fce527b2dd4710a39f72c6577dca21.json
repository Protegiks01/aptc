  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: into_error()] [Field extraction order] The into_error() function extracts message, code, retriable, and details in sequence - can this ordering cause issues if details() panics or if there are side effects in these calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<ApiError> for types::Error] [Move semantics] The From implementation moves self to extract details - can this prevent error reuse or cause issues in error handling chains where the same error needs to be referenced multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: From<ApiError> for types::Error] [types::Error construction] The types::Error is constructed with separate fields - is there validation to ensure all required fields are present and consistent, or can invalid Error objects be created? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Cross-function] [Error code uniqueness] Are error codes guaranteed to be unique across all variants, or could refactoring cause code collisions where different errors map to the same code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Cross-function] [Match exhaustiveness] Do all match statements on ApiError cover all variants, or can new variants be added without compiler errors in incomplete matches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Cross-function] [Error message consistency] Are error messages consistent with error codes and details, or can inconsistent error information confuse clients and cause incorrect error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Cross-function] [Retriable consistency] Is the retriable flag consistent with the error semantics, or are there errors marked retriable that should never succeed on retry? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Rosetta compliance] [Error format validation] Does the types::Error format match the Rosetta API specification exactly, or could format mismatches break Rosetta client compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Rosetta compliance] [Required fields] Does the Rosetta spec require certain fields in Error objects, and could missing or incorrect fields cause compliance violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Rosetta compliance] [Error code range] Does the Rosetta spec impose restrictions on error code ranges or values, and could the current numbering scheme violate those restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Clone implementation] ApiError derives Clone - are all fields safe to clone, or could cloning cause issues with shared state or resource handles? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Thread safety] Is ApiError Send + Sync safe, or could error instances be shared across threads in unsafe ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Error propagation] When errors are propagated across async boundaries, can error context be lost or corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Memory safety] [String allocation] Error details use String which requires heap allocation - can creating many errors with large detail strings cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Memory safety] [Static string lifetimes] InvalidTransferOperations uses Option<&'static str> - is this lifetime correct, or could the static reference outlive the actual string data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Memory safety] [Drop implementation] Is there a Drop implementation for ApiError, and if so, does it properly clean up resources in all error variants? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: deserialization_failed()] [Helper function safety] The deserialization_failed() helper allocates a new String - can this be called repeatedly to cause memory exhaustion in error handling paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Function: all()] [Vector allocation] The all() function creates a new Vec each time it's called - can this be called in a tight loop to cause performance degradation or memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Display implementation] [Debug formatting] The Display trait uses Debug formatting - can malicious error data cause formatting panics or expose sensitive debug information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Transaction errors] [SequenceNumberTooOld handling] SequenceNumberTooOld is not retriable - can this cause legitimate transactions to fail permanently during network congestion when sequence numbers advance quickly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Transaction errors] [VmError details] VmError includes error details from VM execution - can these details leak information about contract state or logic that helps attackers craft exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Transaction errors] [InvalidTransactionUpdate message] The message 'Can only update gas unit price' is very specific - does this reveal internal transaction update limitations that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Transaction errors] [TransactionParseError propagation] Can malformed transactions cause TransactionParseError with details that help attackers understand transaction format requirements for crafting attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Gas errors] [MaxGasFeeTooLow exploitation] Can attackers deliberately cause MaxGasFeeTooLow errors to probe for minimum gas prices and front-run transactions by setting just-sufficient gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/error.rs] [Gas errors] [InvalidGasMultiplier validation] Is there validation on what makes a gas multiplier invalid, or can this error be triggered to learn about internal gas calculation logic? (Low)"
