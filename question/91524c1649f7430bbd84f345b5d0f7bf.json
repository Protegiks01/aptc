  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: build()] [State transition bypass] Can an attacker call build() multiple times by exploiting race conditions between the state check and state update, potentially creating duplicate PeerManager instances and causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [State validation bypass] Can start() be called before build() by exploiting the assert_eq! check, allowing uninitialized network components to be started and causing validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Concurrent state corruption] Are state transitions from CREATED to BUILT atomic, or can concurrent build() calls from multiple threads cause state corruption leading to network component duplication? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Race condition] Can the state transition from BUILT to STARTED be exploited via race conditions when multiple executors attempt to start the same network simultaneously, causing duplicate connectivity managers? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Struct: NetworkBuilder] [State validation] Does the state field use proper synchronization primitives (Arc<Mutex>), or can concurrent access lead to TOCTOU vulnerabilities where state checks pass but state changes before action? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Authentication downgrade] Can an attacker manipulate the mutual_authentication flag in NetworkConfig to downgrade from Mutual to MaybeMutual authentication mode, allowing unauthenticated validators to join consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Identity key bypass] Can a malicious node provide a forged identity_key in AuthenticationMode::Mutual without proper validation, allowing validator impersonation and Byzantine attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Authentication mode mismatch] If mutual_authentication is false but the network is validator network, can attackers exploit the AuthenticationMode::MaybeMutual path to inject malicious peers into validator consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new_for_test()] [Test code in production] Can the new_for_test() function be accidentally used in production deployments, bypassing proper authentication checks and allowing test keys to authenticate on mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Config manipulation] Can config.identity_key() be manipulated through configuration file injection to return a controlled key, allowing attacker-controlled validators to join the network? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Outbound limit bypass] Can attackers exploit the conditional outbound_connection_limit logic (None for validator networks) to create unlimited outbound connections from validator nodes, exhausting network resources? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Inbound limit manipulation] Can max_outbound_connections be set to MAX_VALUE through config manipulation, allowing a single malicious node to monopolize all network connections and partition the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Inbound connection exhaustion] Can inbound_connection_limit be bypassed by rapidly opening and closing connections below the limit threshold, causing memory exhaustion through unclosed socket descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Channel size overflow] Can channel_size parameter be set to an extremely large value causing memory allocation failure or integer overflow when multiplying by number of peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Network channel exhaustion] Can network_channel_size be exploited by sending rapid messages to fill all channels simultaneously, blocking consensus message delivery and causing liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Seed collision attack] Can an attacker provide malicious seeds with the same peer_id but different public keys in config.seeds vs config.seed_addrs, causing the extend() operation to fail or accept invalid keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Public key injection] In the seeds.values_mut().for_each() loop extracting keys from NetworkAddress, can malicious network addresses contain forged noise protocol keys that get inserted into the trusted key set? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Key set manipulation] Can the keys.insert(pubkey) operation be exploited to insert unlimited keys for a single peer, bypassing validator set size limits and causing consensus to accept votes from phantom validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Role confusion] Can seed_addrs entries with PeerRole::ValidatorFullNode be merged with seeds entries that have PeerRole::Validator, creating role confusion that allows full nodes to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Extend panic] Can the peer.extend(peer.clone()).unwrap() call panic if keys are incompatible, causing validator startup failure and network liveness issues during reconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Seed validation bypass] Does verify_seeds() properly validate all seed addresses, or can malformed addresses bypass validation and cause panics later when parsing NetworkAddress? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Empty seed set] Can both config.seeds and config.seed_addrs be empty, returning an empty PeerSet that causes validators to have no peers and creating network partition? (High)",
