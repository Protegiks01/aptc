  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [Atomic file operations] When saving the identity key, is the write atomic (e.g., write to temp file then rename), or can partial writes during crashes lead to corrupted key files that prevent node startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [File permissions] After creating IDENTITY_KEY_FILE, are file permissions immediately set to restrict access, or is there a window where the file is world-readable before permissions are applied? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [Symbolic link attacks] Can an attacker create a symbolic link at IDENTITY_KEY_FILE pointing to a system file, causing the node to overwrite critical files when saving the identity key? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 226-231] [Disk space exhaustion] Is there checking for available disk space before writing the identity key, or can disk exhaustion cause partial writes that corrupt the key file? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 67-73] [Precedence documentation] The precedence order is documented but not enforced in code - can bugs in .is_null() checking cause the optimizer to override user-provided values against the stated precedence rules? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 203] [Null check bypass] The .is_null() check might not catch all cases of unset values (e.g., empty strings, default values) - can attackers provide subtle non-null values that pass the check but don't actually configure seeds properly? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 252, 258] [Multiple null checks] Two separate null checks for network_id and mutual_authentication - can the checks have inconsistent behavior if the YAML structure is malformed, causing one to pass and one to fail unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Cascade effects] If a user provides partial config (e.g., only network_id but not mutual_authentication), does the optimizer create a secure configuration or an inconsistent mix of user and default values? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 344-387] [Test disable_optimizer] The test verifies skip_config_optimizer works, but does it test that all security-critical settings are left at secure defaults when optimization is skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 389-433] [Test mainnet seeds] The test validates seed peers are added, but does it verify the network actually connects to them, or just that the config contains them? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 481-517] [Test no_override] The test checks that user-provided seeds aren't overridden, but does it validate those user-provided seeds are actually valid and secure? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 519-553] [Test no_modifications] The test for validators not getting public seeds is good, but does it test what happens if a validator has public networks configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 555-581] [Test validator network] The test sets incorrect defaults, but are there tests for validators that start with correct defaults? Does the optimizer incorrectly modify already-secure configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 621-652] [Test partial override] The test shows mutual_auth can be enabled even if network_id is overridden, but is this actually the desired behavior or a potential security issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/config_optimizer.rs] [Lines: 655-672] [Test identity loading] Tests load existing identity, but does it test what happens if the file is corrupted, partially written, or contains an invalid key? (Medium)",
