  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Deterministic execution guarantee] Do ModelBuilderOptions affect the determinism of Move VM execution, and can option differences cause validators to produce different state roots from the same transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Missing validation] Does ModelBuilderOptions perform any validation on construction or deserialization to reject invalid combinations like compile_for_testing=true with language_version < V2_2, or can invalid configurations pass through silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Fields: ignore_pragma_opaque_*] [Conflicting flags validation] Are there any checks to prevent contradictory configurations where both opaque ignore flags are set along with other incompatible options, or can this create undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Version compatibility check] Does the system validate that the specified language_version is compatible with the bytecode version produced by the compiler, or can version mismatches cause runtime errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Error propagation] When ModelBuilderOptions contains invalid values, are errors properly propagated and compilation fails safely, or can compilation continue with undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: ignore_pragma_opaque_internal_only] [Documentation ambiguity] Is the definition of 'internal function' and 'unknown callers' clearly specified and consistently enforced, or can attackers exploit documentation ambiguities to misclassify security-critical functions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Fields: ignore_pragma_opaque_*] [Concrete/abstract property definition] Are the [concrete] and [abstract] property semantics precisely defined, and can attackers exploit specification loopholes to ignore opaque pragma even when these properties are present? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Testing mode scope] Does the documentation clearly specify which security checks are disabled or modified when compile_for_testing=true, or can attackers discover undocumented testing bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Field addition attack] If new fields are added to ModelBuilderOptions in future versions, does serde's deny_unknown_fields prevent deserializing old configurations, and can this be exploited to force use of insecure defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Backward compatibility] When upgrading from older ModelBuilderOptions schemas, are migration paths secure, or can attackers exploit migration logic to inject malicious configuration during upgrade? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Language version downgrade] During network upgrades, can validators temporarily downgrade their language_version to maintain compatibility, and does this create a window for exploiting deprecated security features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Timing side channel] Can attackers infer the values of ModelBuilderOptions fields by measuring compilation time differences caused by opaque pragma ignoring or testing mode compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: compile_for_testing] [Feature detection] Can attackers probe whether a deployed module was compiled with compile_for_testing=true by testing for presence of test-only behavior, revealing potential vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Configuration inference] Can attackers infer ModelBuilderOptions values used during compilation by analyzing verification reports, error messages, or bytecode characteristics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Concurrent modification] If ModelBuilderOptions stored in GlobalEnv is accessed by multiple compilation threads without proper synchronization, can race conditions cause options to be partially read/written leading to undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Clone during concurrent access] When ModelBuilderOptions is cloned during parallel compilation, are there any data races in accessing the underlying LanguageVersion enum or boolean fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Struct: ModelBuilderOptions] [Build-time injection] Can attackers compromise the build process to inject malicious default values into the Default trait implementation for ModelBuilderOptions, affecting all downstream users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Dependencies: serde] [Dependency vulnerability] Are there known vulnerabilities in the specific serde version used for ModelBuilderOptions serialization that could be exploited through crafted configuration payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/options.rs] [Field: language_version] [Metadata crate dependency] Does the LanguageVersion type from metadata crate have any vulnerabilities in its FromStr or Display implementations that could cause parsing errors or buffer overflows? (Medium)"
