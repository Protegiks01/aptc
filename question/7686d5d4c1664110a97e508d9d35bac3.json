  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Builder Pattern] [Cloning Side Effects] Since PartitionerV1Config implements Clone, can cloning a partially-initialized builder create multiple configs with inconsistent states if some builder methods modify internal references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Builder Pattern] [Method Chaining] Can incorrect method chaining (e.g., num_shards(0).max_partitioning_rounds(100)) create internally inconsistent configurations that pass compilation but fail at runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: default()] [Invalid Defaults] The Default implementation calls new() which sets num_shards=0 - can code using PartitionerV1Config::default().build() inadvertently create a broken partitioner, causing validator initialization failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: default()] [Semantic Confusion] Does the default configuration with num_shards=0 serve any valid purpose, or is it a latent bug that could be triggered by automatic Default trait usage in deserialization or configuration loading? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Shallow Copy Issues] PartitionerV1Config derives Copy - if the struct is later modified to contain heap-allocated data (Box, Vec, etc.), will removing Copy cause widespread compilation failures across the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Derive: Clone, Copy] [Concurrent Modification] Since the struct implements Copy, can it be trivially copied and modified concurrently, creating race conditions where different code paths use different configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Derive: Parser] [CLI Injection] The struct derives clap::Parser - can command-line arguments be injected to set malicious values for num_shards, max_partitioning_rounds, or threshold, bypassing any validation in application code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Derive: Parser] [Type Coercion] Can clap's automatic type parsing cause unexpected coercion, such as parsing negative numbers as large unsigned values due to two's complement wrapping, creating invalid configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Derive: Parser] [Missing Validation] Since clap::Parser automatically parses command-line arguments, are there any validation attributes (like #[clap(value_parser = ...)]) that enforce valid ranges, or can any value be passed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [Type Alias Confusion] max_partitioning_rounds uses RoundId (type alias for usize) - can confusion between RoundId, ShardId, and TxnIndex (all usize aliases) cause incorrect values to be passed to different fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Type Conversion] When build() passes config fields to ShardedBlockPartitioner::new(), are there any implicit type conversions (usize to u64, f32 to f64) that could lose precision or overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Struct: PartitionerV1Config] [Consensus Requirement] Is PartitionerV1Config guaranteed to be identical across all validators in the network, or can nodes use different configurations leading to divergent block partitioning and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Struct: PartitionerV1Config] [Configuration Drift] Can validators update their PartitionerV1Config at runtime without coordination, causing mid-epoch configuration divergence that breaks parallel execution assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Float Serialization] When serializing/deserializing the f32 threshold across network messages or storage, can different float representations cause validators to use slightly different threshold values, breaking determinism? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Heap Allocation] Does build() return Box<dyn BlockPartitioner>, and can repeated calls to build() on the same config cause memory leaks if the returned boxes are not properly dropped? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Array Allocation] Can large num_shards values cause ShardedBlockPartitioner to allocate enormous arrays for per-shard data structures, leading to out-of-memory errors on validators with limited RAM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Modulo Operation] Since num_shards is used in modulo operations (hash % num_shards) in get_anchor_shard_id(), can num_shards=0 cause a panic, or can num_shards=1 degenerate partitioning to sequential execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: max_partitioning_rounds] [Loop Bounds] If max_partitioning_rounds is used as a loop bound, can setting it to 0 cause loops to never execute, skipping critical partitioning logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: num_shards] [Multiplication Overflow] Can num_shards * max_partitioning_rounds overflow when computing total round-shard combinations, causing incorrect buffer allocations or index calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Float Comparison] Since f32 does not implement Eq (only PartialEq), can comparing two configs with NaN thresholds cause unexpected inequality, breaking caching or memoization logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Struct: PartitionerV1Config] [Struct Comparison] Does PartitionerV1Config implement PartialEq/Eq, or can two semantically equivalent configs (same field values) be treated as different due to float precision issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Trait: PartitionerConfig] [build() Panic] If ShardedBlockPartitioner::new() panics due to invalid parameters, can this propagate through build() without being caught, crashing the validator during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Trait: PartitionerConfig] [Trait Object Safety] Is Box<dyn BlockPartitioner> used safely across FFI boundaries or async contexts, or can vtable issues cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Struct: PartitionerV1Config] [Send/Sync] Does PartitionerV1Config implement Send+Sync, and can it be safely shared across threads without additional synchronization, or can concurrent reads/writes cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: build()] [Thread Safety] Can build() be called concurrently on the same config from multiple threads, and if so, does it create independent BlockPartitioner instances or share mutable state? (Medium)"
