  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: generate_module_payload()] [Metadata Injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious BuiltPackage with corrupted metadata that passes extract_metadata().expect() but causes state corruption when published, potentially allowing unauthorized module upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: generate_module_payload()] [Code Extraction Bypass] Does extract_code() properly validate bytecode integrity, or can an attacker inject malicious bytecode that bypasses Move VM safety checks during module publication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: generate_module_payload()] [BCS Serialization Attack] Can malformed package metadata cause bcs::to_bytes().expect() to panic or produce non-deterministic output, leading to state divergence across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: generate_module_payload()] [Package Size DoS] Does the function enforce limits on package code size, or can an attacker publish extremely large modules that exhaust storage or cause memory exhaustion during deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: generate_module_payload()] [Metadata Validation Gap] Does extract_metadata() verify cryptographic signatures or checksums, or can an attacker publish packages with tampered metadata claiming false dependencies or capabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Hardcoded Gas Bypass] The function uses hardcoded max_gas_amount(2_000_000) and gas_unit_price(200) - can an attacker exploit these fixed values to publish gas-intensive modules that should be rejected by dynamic gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Sequence Number Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to execute_module_txn() with the same sequence_number parameter cause transaction replay or nonce confusion, allowing duplicate module publications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Write Set Application Attack] Does apply_write_set() validate write set integrity before application, or can an attacker inject malicious state changes through crafted transaction outputs that bypass consensus validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Timing Side Channel] Does the Instant::now() timing measurement expose transaction execution patterns that could leak sensitive information about module complexity or reveal timing attack vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Status Assertion Bypass] The assert on line 61 checks status().status().unwrap().is_success() - can a transaction fail after apply_write_set() but before the assertion, leaving partial state changes committed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Transaction Output Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a signed transaction that produces a txn_output with valid write_set() but malicious status information, causing state inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Gas Price Manipulation] Does the hardcoded gas_unit_price(200) match actual network gas prices, or can discrepancies allow attackers to publish modules at artificially low costs, enabling spam attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Signature Forgery] Does account.transaction().sign() properly use cryptographic signatures, or can an attacker bypass signature validation in the benchmarking context to publish unauthorized modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Elapsed Time Integer Overflow] Can as_micros() overflow if transaction execution takes extremely long, potentially causing timing measurement corruption or panic in production environments? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_module_txn()] [Double Write Set Application] Is there protection against calling apply_write_set() multiple times for the same transaction, which could cause duplicate state changes or storage corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [Unmetered Gas Exploit] The function uses GasMeterType::UnmeteredGasMeter - can an attacker exploit this to execute arbitrarily expensive operations without gas limits, causing resource exhaustion or consensus delays? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [Hardcoded Iteration Count] The exec_func_record_running_time() executes with iteration count 10 - can an attacker craft functions that accumulate state across iterations, causing non-deterministic behavior or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [Empty Parameter Vector Bypass] The function passes empty vec![] for type_args and args - can this bypass function signature validation, allowing execution of functions with unexpected parameter requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [Module Name Confusion] Does the function validate module_name ownership, or can an attacker execute functions from unauthorized modules by providing crafted ModuleId references? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [No Transaction Status Validation] Unlike execute_module_txn(), this function doesn't check execution status - can failed transactions still modify state or cause inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-benchmarks/src/helper.rs] [Function: execute_user_txn()] [Elapsed Microseconds Overflow] Can elapsed_micros() overflow for long-running functions, causing timing measurement corruption or panics in println!() formatting? (Low)",
