  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_move_lang_diagnostics()] [Diagnostic Injection] The function adds diagnostics directly from the Move compiler - can an attacker inject malicious diagnostics that appear to be compiler errors but contain misleading information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_move_lang_diagnostics()] [File ID Confusion] Line 491 looks up loc.file_id() - can file ID mismatches between the compiler and the model cause diagnostics to reference wrong files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_move_lang_diagnostics()] [Label Style Manipulation] Labels are marked as Primary or Secondary based on is_primary - can an attacker manipulate this to hide critical errors by marking them as secondary? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_move_lang_diagnostics()] [Severity Bypass] The function preserves the original severity from the compiler - can an attacker downgrade error severity to warnings to bypass compilation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_move_lang_diagnostics()] [Notes Field Exploitation] Line 503 adds notes to diagnostics - can an attacker inject malicious content in notes that gets executed by diagnostic tooling or IDEs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_addresses_from_options()] [Address Parsing Overflow] The function calls parse_named_address() which may convert strings to NumericalAddress - can an attacker provide extremely large numeric values that cause integer overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_addresses_from_options()] [Address Format Confusion] Can an attacker provide addresses in multiple formats (hex, decimal, etc.) that parse differently than intended, causing address resolution to point to unintended locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_addresses_from_options()] [Duplicate Address Names] The function collects addresses into a BTreeMap - can duplicate named addresses cause the last one to override previous definitions, allowing address substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: parse_addresses_from_options()] [Error Propagation] The function returns anyhow::Result - can parsing errors be suppressed or mishandled, allowing invalid addresses to be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Dependency Order Manipulation] Line 542 sets dependency_order to usize::MAX - can this cause scripts to be processed out of order, violating dependency constraints? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Function Name Collision] Line 536 adds the script's function to the module's function map - can an attacker create scripts with function names that collide with expected module functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Empty Struct Map Exploit] Line 547 creates an empty structs UniqueMap - can code that expects modules to have at least some structs fail when processing script-converted modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Empty Friends Map Attack] Line 546 creates an empty friends UniqueMap - does this allow script modules to bypass friend visibility checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [is_source_module Override] Line 545 sets is_source_module = true - can this cause scripts from dependencies to be treated as source modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Attribute Preservation] Line 540 preserves script attributes - can malicious script attributes bypass attribute validation since they're converted to module attributes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Constants Migration] Line 548 migrates script constants - can constant name collisions or shadowing occur when scripts are converted to modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Specs Handling] Line 550 preserves specs - can script specs contain references that become invalid when converted to module context? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Function: expansion_script_to_module()] [Use Declarations] Line 551 preserves use_decls - can use declarations in scripts create unintended module dependencies when converted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Integration: run_model_builder_with_options_and_compilation_flags() + is_vector()] [Special Module Detection Race] Can an attacker cause the vector module to be detected by is_vector() at line 273 but then substitute it before the module filtering at lines 308-322? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Integration: run_move_checker() + check_and_update_friend_info()] [Friend Declaration Timing Attack] Can an attacker exploit the separation between module translation (line 365) and friend checking (line 385) to create temporary invalid friend relationships?
