  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::replace()] [Constraint default injection] When use_constr is true, defaults from constraints are used. Can an attacker inject unsafe defaults through carefully crafted constraint combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: ReferenceKind] [Mutability tracking] Only two kinds: Immutable and Mutable. Can the lack of read-only vs. write tracking allow attackers to use read-only references for writing in unsafe contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_reference_to_a_reference()] [Nested reference detection] The function checks for &(&T). Can an attacker bypass reference restrictions by creating triple-nested references &(&(&T)) that pass single-nesting checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::skip_reference()] [Reference stripping] The function removes one reference layer. Can an attacker use this in contexts where full reference removal is needed, leading to operations on &T instead of T? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::drop_reference()] [Move semantics] The function consumes self and returns inner type. Can this lead to use-after-move bugs where reference type is accessed after being dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::function()] [Ability set handling] The function creates function type with given ability set. Can an attacker create functions with incorrect abilities (e.g., copy when closures capture non-copyable data)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::get_function_wrapper_ty()] [Wrapper struct detection] The function checks for single positional field of function type. Can an attacker create structs that appear to be function wrappers but have additional hidden fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::has_function()] [Function value detection] The function checks if type or tuple contains functions. Can an attacker hide function values in deeply nested structs to bypass restrictions on function parameters/returns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_function()] [Function type check] Simple pattern match on Fun variant. Can type variables bound to function types bypass this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::get_vector_element_type()] [Element type extraction] Returns None for non-vectors. Can operations expecting vectors silently fail with None, leading to uninitialized element access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: Type] [Vector(Box<Type>)] Vector element is boxed. Can an attacker create deeply nested vector<vector<vector<...>>> causing stack overflow when recursively processing element types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::tuple()] [Empty tuple handling] Empty or single-element vectors get special treatment. Can an attacker exploit the difference between Tuple(vec![T]) and T to bypass type checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::flatten()] [Tuple flattening] Converts single type to vec![type]. Can this cause confusion between tuple and non-tuple types in pattern matching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_unit()] [Unit type check] Only checks for empty tuple. Can non-tuple unit-like types bypass this check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_non_unit_tuple()] [Non-unit tuple check] Checks for non-empty tuple. Can this lead to confusion between Tuple(vec![T]) and T? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Substitution::eval_constraint()] [Error type skip] The function returns Ok(()) for Error types. Can an attacker propagate Error types to skip constraint checking in critical paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Substitution::eval_constraint()] [Constraint transfer] Constraints are transferred to other variables. Can an attacker create constraint loops between variables that cause infinite constraint propagation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Substitution::eval_constraint()] [Reference propagation] Some constraints propagate over references. Can an attacker bypass constraints by wrapping types in references where propagation doesn't occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Substitution::eval_ability_constraint()] [Signer special case] Signer has different abilities than other primitives. Can an attacker exploit this to bypass ability checks by converting between signer and address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::contains()] [Predicate evaluation] The function checks if any subtype matches predicate. Can an attacker craft types where contains() returns false positives due to Error or Var types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::visit()] [Visitor pattern] The function visits all subtypes. Can an attacker cause mutation during visit that invalidates the traversal? (Medium)",
