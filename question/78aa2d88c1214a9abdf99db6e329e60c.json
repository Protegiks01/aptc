  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: num_executor_threads] [Input validation] Can an attacker pass a maliciously large value for num_executor_threads (e.g., usize::MAX or billions) via command line to cause resource exhaustion, memory allocation failures, or thread pool DoS on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: num_executor_threads] [Resource exhaustion] Does the default value of 8 threads ensure bounded resource usage, or can an operator misconfigure this to 0 threads causing execution service deadlock and total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: shard_id] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker or misconfigured operator pass a shard_id that exceeds num_shards, causing array out-of-bounds access in ProcessExecutorService::new() at line 24 when indexing remote_executor_addresses[shard_id]? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: shard_id] [State inconsistency] If shard_id is negative when cast from command-line input (though usize prevents this), could integer underflow or type confusion cause shards to execute incorrect transaction partitions leading to state divergence across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: num_shards] [Validation bypass] Is there validation that num_shards > 0 and num_shards == remote_executor_addresses.len()? If num_shards is 0, could division-by-zero occur in sharding logic causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: num_shards] [Consensus inconsistency] Can validators start with different num_shards values causing transaction execution inconsistencies where validators disagree on state roots due to different sharding strategies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: remote_executor_addresses] [Network security] Are the SocketAddr addresses validated against allowed IP ranges, or can an attacker inject malicious addresses causing the executor to connect to attacker-controlled endpoints enabling MITM attacks on cross-shard execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: remote_executor_addresses] [Array bounds] If remote_executor_addresses is empty or has fewer elements than shard_id, will ProcessExecutorService::new() panic at line 24 causing unrecoverable service crash and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: remote_executor_addresses] [Configuration injection] Can duplicate addresses in remote_executor_addresses cause multiple shards to bind to the same socket, leading to port conflicts, execution failures, or Byzantine behavior in parallel execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: remote_executor_addresses] [Vector overflow] Does the 'num_args = 1..' constraint prevent empty vectors, or could an operator start the service with no remote executors causing cross-shard communication failures and execution deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: coordinator_address] [TOCTOU] Is coordinator_address validated before service start, or can it be pointing to a malicious coordinator that manipulates execution results, leading to state corruption or execution of unauthorized transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args, Field: coordinator_address] [Network partition] If coordinator_address becomes unreachable after initialization, does the executor fail safely or continue processing potentially causing state divergence between coordinator and executor shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 28] [Command-line injection] Does Args::parse() properly sanitize all inputs, or can shell metacharacters, format string exploits, or path traversal sequences in command-line arguments lead to code injection or unauthorized file access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 29] [Logger initialization] If aptos_logger::Logger::new().init() fails silently, could subsequent security-critical events go unlogged, hiding evidence of attacks or making forensic analysis impossible after a breach? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Lines 31-35] [Channel security] Is the unbounded crossbeam channel secure against channel flooding attacks where an attacker sends millions of messages to tx causing memory exhaustion and OOM kills? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Lines 32-35] [Signal handling race] Can a race condition between ctrlc::set_handler() and service initialization cause signals to be dropped, preventing graceful shutdown and potentially leaving the executor in an inconsistent state corrupting on-disk data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 35] [Error handling] The .expect() call will panic if Ctrl-C handler setup fails - could an attacker exhaust signal handler resources causing this panic during validator startup and preventing the service from ever running? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Lines 37-43] [Service initialization] Is ProcessExecutorService::new() atomic, or can partial initialization leave the executor in an inconsistent state where some shards are running but others are not, causing transaction execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 37] [Variable scope] The underscore prefix on _exe_service prevents accidental use, but does this prevent proper cleanup? If Drop is not called correctly, could resources leak or state remain uncommitted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 37] [Concurrency] Is ProcessExecutorService::new() thread-safe? Could multiple services be accidentally started in parallel causing race conditions in AptosVM::set_concurrency_level_once() or conflicting shard registrations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 38-42] [Parameter passing] Are all parameters passed to ProcessExecutorService::new() validated for consistency (e.g., shard_id < num_shards, num_executor_threads > 0), or can invalid combinations cause undefined behavior in the execution engine? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Lines 45-46] [Shutdown sequence] If rx.recv() is called but tx was dropped or corrupted, could .expect() panic causing ungraceful shutdown without flushing state, leading to state inconsistencies or data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 45] [Blocking receive] Does rx.recv() block indefinitely if no Ctrl-C is received? Could an operator unable to send SIGINT (e.g., in containerized environments) be unable to gracefully shutdown, forcing kill -9 and causing data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main(), Line 47] [Shutdown logging] The info!() log at line 47 indicates successful shutdown, but if ProcessExecutorService::drop() fails or takes too long, does this log provide a false sense of safety while state remains uncommitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [No explicit cleanup] There is no explicit call to _exe_service.shutdown() - cleanup relies entirely on Drop trait. Could unexpected panic paths or process termination bypass Drop causing incomplete state commits or resource leaks? (High)"
