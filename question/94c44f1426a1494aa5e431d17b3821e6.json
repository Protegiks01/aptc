  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Multi-Exp Empty Input] If the poks vector is empty after construction at lines 70-73, does HasMultiExp::multi_exp_iter handle empty iterators correctly or does it return a non-identity result that breaks verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Multi-Exp Scalar Zero] If any scalar in the batch verification is zero, does the multi-exp implementation correctly handle zero exponents, or can this cause the base point to be incorrectly included/excluded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [BLS Signature Point Validation] Does the verify_aggregate call at line 102 validate that signature points are in the correct subgroup and not at infinity before verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [BLS Public Key Validation] Are the BLS public keys in spks validated to be in the prime-order subgroup before use in aggregate verification, or can invalid public keys break pairing security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [BLS Pairing Degenerate Case] If any public key or signature is the identity element, can the bilinear pairing return unexpected results that cause valid signatures to fail or invalid signatures to pass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [BLS Message Hashing] The Contribution structs are hashed for signature verification - does the hash-to-curve implementation have vulnerabilities like differential attacks or hash collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [BLS Signature Substitution] After aggregation, can an attacker substitute the aggregate signature with a different valid aggregate that covers a subset of messages, passing verification with wrong transcript? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Error Message Information Leak] Error messages at lines 41-45, 49-53, 63-67 reveal exact array lengths and commitment values - can this timing/content information be used for fingerprinting or adaptive attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Early Return Information Leak] The function returns early on length mismatches before cryptographic checks - does this timing difference leak which validation failed, allowing attackers to probe the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Anyhow Error Propagation] The function returns anyhow::Result - can error context wrapping leak stack traces or internal state that reveals validator secrets or DKG intermediate values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Partial Verification State] If pok_batch_verify succeeds but verify_aggregate fails, does the partial success state persist in a way that could be exploited in multi-round DKG protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Panic vs Error Return] Do any operations use panic! instead of returning Err, and can attackers trigger panics to cause validator crashes during DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Vector Capacity Pre-allocation] Vectors are created with capacity hints (lines 78-79, 82-87, 92-95) - can incorrect capacity calculations cause repeated reallocations that degrade to O(n^2) performance, enabling DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Iterator Invalidation] The iter() and map() operations on soks, msgs, spks - can iterator invalidation occur if the underlying data is modified during iteration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Clone Overhead] Auxiliary data and signatures are cloned multiple times (lines 85, 98) - can this cause memory exhaustion with large DKG transcript sets (1000+ validators)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Reference Lifetime] The msgs_refs vector at lines 88-91 contains references to msgs elements - can msgs be dropped before msgs_refs is used, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Slice Bounds] The verify_aggregate call uses &msgs_refs[..] and &pks[..] slice syntax - can out-of-bounds access occur if the arrays were modified between construction and use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Caller Responsibility] The function assumes callers provide consistent soks/spks/aux arrays - if calling code has bugs, can malformed inputs bypass safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Cross-Protocol Replay] Can valid SoK tuples from one DKG protocol instance be replayed in a different instance to forge validator participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Transcript Binding] Are the verified contributions cryptographically bound to the DKG transcript, or can they be lifted and used in different contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Validator Set Changes] During epoch transitions with validator set changes, can old SoKs from removed validators be replayed with new validator public keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Concurrent Verification] If multiple threads call batch_verify_soks concurrently with overlapping input arrays, can race conditions in shared state cause verification bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Secret Recovery Attack] Can the PoK verification leak information about the secret polynomial coefficients through timing, error messages, or partial verification results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Commitment Binding] Are commitments properly bound to the specific DKG round and validator set, or can commitments be reused across different DKG sessions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Soundness Violation] Can an attacker provide valid-looking PoKs and signatures without actually knowing the discrete log of their commitment? (Critical)"
