  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field node_type] [NodeType Downgrade] Conversely, can an attacker downgrade node_type from Validator to Unknown in a JWT to evade monitoring, audit logging, or rate limiting that applies specifically to validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Stale Epoch Attack] Claims contains epoch (u64) representing the validator set epoch. If a validator's JWT has epoch=10 but current epoch is 11, can the attacker still use the old token to send telemetry for the previous epoch, potentially submitting fraudulent historical data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Epoch Overflow] epoch is u64. Can epoch overflow (wrapping to 0) in far future cause tokens with epoch=0 to suddenly become valid again, enabling reuse of ancient tokens? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Epoch Race Condition] During epoch transitions, can validators have JWTs for both epoch N and N+1 simultaneously? Can this be exploited to double-submit telemetry or cause inconsistencies in epoch-based authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Future Epoch Forgery] Can an attacker predict future epoch numbers and create JWT Claims with epoch=current+1, attempting to pre-authenticate for the next epoch before it begins? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Zero Epoch] Is epoch=0 valid? Can an attacker create tokens with epoch=0 to bypass epoch validation logic that might treat 0 as a special/uninitialized value? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field run_uuid] [Session Fixation] If run_uuid is meant to uniquely identify a validator node instance/session, can an attacker who obtains a JWT with a specific run_uuid forge new JWTs with the same run_uuid to make their malicious telemetry appear to come from the same validator session? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field run_uuid] [UUID Collision] Uuid is 128 bits. While collisions are unlikely, can an attacker deliberately generate UUIDs that collide with known validator run_uuids to cause telemetry data merging, metric corruption, or attribution attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field run_uuid] [Session Hijacking] If run_uuid is used to track validator sessions for analytics/monitoring, can stealing a JWT allow an attacker to inject telemetry into an existing validator's session, poisoning their metrics and potentially causing them to be falsely flagged for misbehavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field run_uuid] [Nil UUID Attack] Can an attacker use Uuid::nil() (all zeros) as run_uuid to either trigger special handling code paths or cause all their telemetry to merge with the default UUID, breaking per-instance tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Malformed JSON] Can deeply nested JSON objects in AuthRequest cause stack overflow during serde deserialization? For example, nesting peer_id as {\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Extra Fields Attack] Does serde::Deserialize silently ignore unknown fields in AuthRequest JSON? Can an attacker include thousands of large extra fields to cause memory exhaustion without triggering validation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker send AuthRequest with field type mismatches (e.g., chain_id as string instead of ChainId) to trigger deserialization errors that leak information through error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Claims Injection] When Claims is serialized into JWT, can an attacker inject additional claims by exploiting serde serialization to add fields that override security-critical values during JWT verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthResponse] [Response Deserialization] If clients deserialize AuthResponse, can malicious telemetry servers send crafted responses with enormous handshake_msg arrays to DoS clients through memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Algorithm Confusion] Although not defined in types/auth.rs, Claims are encoded into JWTs. Can an attacker modify the JWT header to specify 'none' algorithm, causing the server to accept unsigned tokens with arbitrary Claims? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Key Confusion] If multiple JWT signing keys exist (per-chain or rotated keys), can an attacker craft Claims signed with a weak/compromised key and exploit key confusion to pass validation meant for a different key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [Claims Tampering] After JWT is created with Claims, can an attacker modify the JWT payload (change peer_id, node_type, epoch, exp) without breaking the signature if HMAC-based signing is used with a weak shared secret? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Parsing Vulnerabilities] Can malformed Claims in JWT (e.g., exp as negative number, peer_id with invalid bytes) cause panics or undefined behavior during jsonwebtoken library decoding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [TOCTOU Epoch Check] Between when Claims is created with current epoch and when it's verified in authorize_jwt(), can the epoch change, causing the token to become invalid mid-flight? If so, can this be exploited to cause authentication failures during epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field exp] [TOCTOU Expiration] If Claims.exp is checked at JWT creation time but not during token verification (relying only on signature validity), can expired tokens be accepted? Conversely, can concurrent time updates cause valid tokens to appear expired? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Concurrent Authentication] If a validator authenticates concurrently from multiple nodes with the same peer_id but different run_uuid values, can race conditions in Claims creation cause UUID conflicts or token collisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest field server_public_key] [Weak Curve Points] Can an attacker provide x25519 public keys that are weak points on the curve (low-order points, identity point) to compromise the Noise handshake and recover the server's session keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest field handshake_msg] [Noise Protocol Downgrade] Can an attacker manipulate handshake_msg to downgrade the Noise protocol to a weaker variant or force the use of weak cryptographic parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthResponse field handshake_msg] [Key Leakage] If the server reuses ephemeral keys across multiple Noise handshakes, can analyzing multiple AuthResponse.handshake_msg values reveal patterns that leak the server's long-term private key? (High)"
