(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/examine/print_raw_data_by_version.rs] [Function: run(), Line 25-28] [State Corruption] Does the mismatch between actual database sharding and the sharding_config parameter cause silent data corruption where the tool reads state from wrong shards, potentially masking consensus bugs or storage corruption? (High)",
