  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: new()] [State inconsistency] Can an attacker exploit the scenario where table_info_reader and db_indexer_reader are at different ledger versions during construction, causing queries to return inconsistent state data that violates Merkle tree integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: new()] [Availability bypass] Can a malicious node deliberately pass None for both readers to cause IndexerReaders::new() to return None, making the system fall back to less secure or unindexed query paths that bypass access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: new()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to new() with the same Arc<IndexerAsyncV2> or Arc<DBIndexer> instances create race conditions where one reader gets updated while another is being cloned, leading to inconsistent query results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call new() with valid readers to create unbounded IndexerReaders instances, exhausting memory through Arc reference counting without proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: is_internal_indexer_enabled()] [Logic bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the DBIndexer instance state to make is_internal_indexer_enabled() return false when it should return true, causing the API to incorrectly route queries to unindexed paths? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_by_event_key()] [Inconsistent checks] Does get_events_by_event_key() perform the same security validations as get_events(), or can it be used to bypass event_enabled() checks through a different code path? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transactions()] [Feature flag bypass] Can an attacker craft requests that bypass the transaction_enabled() check at line 125, accessing transaction data even when the indexer feature is disabled? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Handle validation] Does get_table_info() validate that the TableHandle parameter is legitimate, or can an attacker provide crafted handles to access arbitrary memory locations or system tables? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Version inconsistency] Can get_table_info() return table metadata from a different ledger version than expected, causing transactions to operate on stale or inconsistent table state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Error handling leak] When table_info_reader is None and the function bails at line 51, does the error message leak information about which indexer components are enabled/disabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/indexer_reader.rs] [Function: get_table_info()] [Retry attack] Can an attacker exploit the get_table_info_with_retry() mechanism to cause excessive database queries, leading to resource exhaustion or slowdowns affecting consensus? (Medium)",
