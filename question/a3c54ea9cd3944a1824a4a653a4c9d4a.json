  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Iterator trait - Medium] Does the Iterator::sum implementation for Scalar correctly handle empty iterators (though prevented by assertions)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Stack overflow - Low] Can very large n values cause stack overflow when allocating the ids and shares vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Heap allocation - Low] Are heap allocations for ids and shares vectors properly bounded to prevent OOM attacks with malicious n values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Vector capacity - Low] Do the vector allocations at lines 25 and 34 properly reserve capacity to avoid multiple reallocations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Memory cleanup - Medium] Are all temporary vectors (ids, shares, lagr) properly dropped after reconstruction to prevent leaking sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Consensus key reconstruction - Critical] If this function is used to reconstruct validator consensus keys from shares, can Byzantine validators provide malicious shares that cause honest validators to reconstruct different keys, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Signature aggregation - Critical] When reconstructing threshold signatures, can incorrect reconstruction produce signatures that verify but commit to wrong transactions, enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Epoch key rotation - High] During epoch transitions with key rotation, can reconstruction failures cause validators to lose access to their keys, halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Validator bootstrapping - High] When new validators join and need to reconstruct shared secrets from existing validators' shares, can timing attacks or share manipulation compromise the bootstrap process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Computational DoS - Medium] Can an attacker force expensive Lagrange coefficient computations by providing maximum allowed shares, causing validator performance degradation during threshold operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Memory DoS - Medium] Can repeated reconstruction calls with maximum n values exhaust memory through vector allocations, causing validator node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/scalar_secret_key.rs] [Function: reconstruct()] [Panic-based DoS - High] Can Byzantine nodes intentionally trigger assert panics by sending threshold-violating shares, causing honest validator nodes to crash during critical operations? (High)"
