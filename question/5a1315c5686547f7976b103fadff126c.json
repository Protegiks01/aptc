  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [File Handle Leaks] When creating a file logger at line 107-109, are file handles properly closed and managed, or could repeated logger reconfigurations leak file descriptors? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: format_record_file()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] If trace-level logging is enabled for a long-running compilation with verbose output, could unbounded log file growth exhaust available disk space, causing system-wide denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: format_record_colored()] [Memory Exhaustion] When formatting colored output at line 142, are there limits on the size of record.args() to prevent memory exhaustion from extremely large log messages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply Chain Risk] The file imports colored and flexi_logger crates at lines 47-48 - have these dependencies been audited for vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the logging interface? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Logger Backend Vulnerabilities] Does the flexi_logger library properly sanitize file paths and log content, or could vulnerabilities in the logging backend be exploited through crafted MVC_LOG values? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Empty Environment Variable] If MVC_LOG is set to an empty string '', lines 71-85 will create a trace-level logger - is this the intended behavior, or could it cause unexpected verbose logging? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Multiple @ Separators] At line 86, rsplitn(2, '@') splits on '@' - what happens if MVC_LOG contains multiple '@' characters like 'info@file1@file2'? Could this cause unexpected parsing behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Special Characters in Path] Does the path handling properly escape or reject special characters like null bytes, newlines, or control characters that could corrupt file paths or cause security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Very Long Paths] Are there length limits on the file path at line 97-99? Could an attacker specify an extremely long path that exceeds filesystem limits or causes buffer issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Level Precedence] When both the 'level' parameter and MVC_LOG environment variable are set at lines 72-83, which takes precedence? Could this ambiguity cause security-relevant logging to be disabled unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: setup_logging()] [API Confusion] At line 55-57, setup_logging() is identical to setup_logging_for_testing() - could this API confusion lead developers to use the wrong function in production vs. testing, affecting log behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Silent Failures] At line 85, the function returns None if env::var() fails, causing setup_logging_for_testing() at line 62 to skip logger initialization - could important errors or security events go unlogged due to this silent failure? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: setup_logging_for_testing()] [Ignored Errors] At line 65, logger.start() errors are explicitly ignored with 'let _ = ' - could this hide critical initialization failures that should be reported to users? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Cross-Platform Path Issues] The path checking at line 95 uses '/' as separator - does this work correctly on Windows where paths might use backslashes, or could it fail to detect absolute paths on Windows? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: format_record_colored()] [Terminal Compatibility] The colored output at lines 135-141 uses ANSI color codes - are these properly handled on Windows terminals that might not support ANSI, potentially causing garbled output? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: format_record_file()] [Timing Side Channel] Does writing to log files at line 121-127 introduce timing variations that could leak information about compilation progress or internal state through timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/logging.rs] [Function: configure_logger()] [Observable Behavior] Can an attacker detect whether logging is enabled or the log level by observing file system activity or process behavior, potentially gaining information about the debugging state? (Low)"
