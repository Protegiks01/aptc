  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: wait_for_transactions()] [Early Exit] If one transaction in the vector fails, do subsequent transactions still get checked, or does the function exit early, potentially missing successful transactions in the batch? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: wait_for_transactions()] [Timeout Consistency] Is the 60-second Duration timeout properly coordinated with the 30-second sys_time offset, or can edge cases cause the function to timeout before transactions have a fair chance to commit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dispatch_transaction()] [Logic Error] Are the mutual exclusivity checks (lines 506-522) complete, or can an attacker find a combination of flags that bypasses these checks and causes undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dispatch_transaction()] [Transaction Routing] Can an attacker manipulate txn_options_ref to route sensitive transactions through local simulation instead of actual submission, preventing them from executing on-chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dispatch_transaction()] [Gas Profiling Attack] Does the profile_gas path properly isolate execution to prevent side effects, or can attackers use it to test exploits without committing them to chain? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dispatch_transaction()] [Benchmark Manipulation] Can the benchmark path be abused to consume excessive local resources, degrading validator performance through repeated heavy computation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dispatch_transaction()] [Session Path Validation] Does the session path properly validate the session_path file for tampering before using it for simulation, preventing malicious session data injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_json_file()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious JSON file that exploits vulnerabilities in serde_json deserialization, causing code execution or memory corruption when parsing configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_json_file()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an extremely large JSON file (gigabytes) be provided that causes read_from_file() to OOM before deserialization even begins, crashing the CLI? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_json_file()] [Type Confusion] If the JSON structure doesn't match the expected type T, does serde_json return a safe error, or can type confusion lead to memory unsafety when the wrong type is accessed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: parse_json_file()] [Unicode Bypass] Can an attacker use unusual Unicode normalization or encoding in JSON strings to bypass validation checks that would normally reject malicious input? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: view_json_option_str()] [JSON Injection] Can an attacker provide a JSON object with nested 'vec' fields that cause incorrect parsing, potentially returning the wrong value or causing panics in downstream consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: view_json_option_str()] [Array Length Check] Does the check for vec_array.len() > 1 properly prevent all edge cases, or can extremely large arrays cause memory issues before this validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: view_json_option_str()] [Type Coercion] When checking option_val_ref.as_str(), can numeric or boolean JSON values be coerced to strings in unexpected ways, causing incorrect option parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: view_json_option_str()] [Null Handling] Does the function properly distinguish between null values and missing fields, or can attackers exploit this ambiguity to bypass optional field validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: explorer_account_link()] [URL Injection] Can an attacker craft an AccountAddress that contains URL-unsafe characters or injection payloads that, when formatted into the explorer link, create XSS or open redirect vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: explorer_account_link()] [Network Confusion] If the network parameter is manipulated to an unexpected value (not mainnet/testnet/devnet), does the explorer link break or redirect to attacker-controlled domains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: explorer_transaction_link()] [Hash Injection] Can the to_hex_literal() formatting of transaction hashes be exploited with malformed hash values to inject JavaScript or HTML into the explorer URL? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: explorer_transaction_link()] [Phishing Vector] Can attackers create legitimate-looking explorer links that redirect to phishing sites by exploiting the network parameter or hash format? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: strip_private_key_prefix()] [Prefix Bypass] Can an attacker provide a key with mixed-case prefix like 'Ed25519-Priv-' that bypasses the starts_with() check due to case sensitivity, allowing unsupported key types through? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: strip_private_key_prefix()] [Key Type Confusion] If a key starts with both enabled and disabled prefixes (e.g., 'ed25519-priv-secp256k1-priv-...'), which check wins, and can this cause type confusion in cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: strip_private_key_prefix()] [Unicode Homoglyph] Can an attacker use Unicode characters that look identical to ASCII prefix characters to bypass the prefix checks and inject unsupported key types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: strip_private_key_prefix()] [Whitespace Bypass] Does the function trim whitespace before checking prefixes, or can leading/trailing spaces cause valid prefixes to be missed, accepting unprefixed keys incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: deserialize_address_str()] [Address Parsing] Can an attacker provide an address string with unusual formatting (uppercase, no 0x prefix, wrong length) that passes parsing but represents a different address than intended? (High)",
