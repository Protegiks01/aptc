  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Key validation] Are handle and key parameters validated to ensure they don't point to existing state, or can overwriting existing aggregators cause supply corruption for other coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Encoding limits] Can BCS encoding fail for CoinInfoResource with extremely large name/symbol fields, and if so, is the error handled gracefully or does it cause validator panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Supply encoding] Does BCS encoding of u128 supply value handle edge cases like u128::MAX correctly, or can encoding bugs cause supply corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Malformed BCS] Can malformed BCS input cause deserialization to succeed but create CoinInfoResource with invalid field values that break invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Legacy modification] Why use WriteOp::legacy_modification instead of creation/modification/deletion distinctions, and can this cause issues with state versioning or transaction replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Write ordering] Does the order of writes in the write_set vector matter, and can incorrect ordering cause the CoinInfo write to succeed but aggregator write to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Write atomicity] Are both writes in to_writeset() applied atomically, or can partial application occur if a validator crashes between the two writes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Supply initialization] Does new() initialize supply aggregator with value 0, or can non-zero initial supply values be set that don't match actual minted coins? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Supply limit validation] Is supply parameter validated against aggregator limit to ensure supply <= limit invariant, or can invalid initial supply values break aggregator invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: supply] [None vs Some] Can supply=None be used to create coins without supply tracking, and if so, can this be exploited to bypass supply limits and mint unlimited coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: supply_aggregator_state_key()] [Aggregator sync] Is the StateKey returned by supply_aggregator_state_key() guaranteed to be in sync with the actual aggregator resource in state storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module integration] Does the MODULE_NAME='coin' match the actual Move coin module deployment, or can mismatches cause resource lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Storage integration] Does to_writeset() create writesets compatible with AptosDB storage layer, or can encoding differences cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: name] [Empty name] Can name be an empty Vec<u8>, creating coins with no name that break UI/API assumptions about coin metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: symbol] [Empty symbol] Can symbol be an empty Vec<u8>, and if so, does symbol() return Ok(String::new()) or Err, potentially breaking code that assumes non-empty symbols? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: decimals] [Zero decimals] Can decimals=0 be set, and does this break calculations that divide by 10^decimals, causing division by zero or incorrect normalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: symbol()] [Clone performance] Does clone() on symbol field create performance issues if called frequently with large symbol values, causing validator slowdowns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [Deep copy] Is CoinInfoResource fully copyable or does it have move semantics that prevent duplication, and can this be exploited to create duplicate coin metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Error context] Does StateKey::resource_typed error provide sufficient context for debugging if address derivation fails, or can errors be silently ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Result unwrap] Is the Result from StateKey::resource_typed properly propagated, or are there code paths that unwrap it causing panics on invalid addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: random()] [Non-determinism] Can random() introduce non-determinism if called during transaction execution, causing validators to produce different state roots and break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Serialize] [Serialization order] Is field serialization order deterministic across different Rust versions and platforms, ensuring all validators produce identical BCS encodings? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Hardcoded metadata] Why are name='AptosCoin', symbol='APT', decimals=8 hardcoded in new(), and can this be exploited to create counterfeit APT metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: random()] [Test-only usage] Is random() clearly marked as test-only, and are there runtime guards preventing its use in production to avoid non-determinism? (High)"
