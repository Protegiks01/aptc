  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: AptosBaseUrl::to_url()] [Panic vulnerability] Can the hardcoded URLs for Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet cause panic through unwrap() if URL parsing fails due to memory corruption or invalid static strings, potentially causing client crashes during critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: AptosBaseUrl::to_url()] [URL manipulation] Can an attacker who controls the Custom(Url) variant bypass URL validation by providing malicious URLs that could lead to SSRF attacks against internal Aptos infrastructure when the client connects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: AptosBaseUrl::to_url()] [DNS rebinding] Does the Custom URL variant validate that the resolved IP address hasn't changed between DNS lookup and connection, potentially allowing DNS rebinding attacks to access internal validator nodes?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::new()] [Silent failure] Does the unwrap() on api_key() silently panic if X_API_KEY contains invalid characters, causing client initialization to fail without proper error handling during critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::new()] [Header injection] Can the X_APTOS_CLIENT header value be exploited if X_APTOS_SDK_HEADER_VALUE contains newline characters or other HTTP header injection payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::new()] [Default timeout DoS] Is the default 10-second timeout sufficient to prevent slowloris-style attacks where a malicious node keeps connections open, exhausting client resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::new()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to new() with different X_API_KEY environment values cause race conditions in credential management if the environment is modified between reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::base_url()] [SSRF vulnerability] Can an attacker provide a base_url pointing to internal metadata services (169.254.169.254) or internal validator nodes to extract sensitive configuration or credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::base_url()] [URL scheme bypass] Does base_url() validate that only HTTPS URLs are accepted, or can an attacker downgrade to HTTP to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on transaction submissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::base_url()] [Path traversal] Can a malicious base_url with path traversal sequences (../) be combined with version_path_base to access unauthorized API endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::base_url()] [Unicode homograph] Can base_url accept URLs with unicode characters that visually resemble legitimate Aptos domains but point to phishing or malicious nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::base_url()] [Port manipulation] Does base_url() allow arbitrary ports that could be used to bypass firewall rules or connect to unauthorized services masquerading as Aptos nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::timeout()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide a Duration with u64::MAX microseconds causing integer overflow in timeout calculations, leading to immediate timeouts or infinite waits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::timeout()] [Zero timeout DoS] Can setting timeout to Duration::ZERO cause all API requests to fail immediately, effectively DoSing the client application? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::timeout()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an extremely large timeout value (e.g., years) cause clients to hold connections indefinitely, exhausting system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/client_builder.rs] [Function: ClientBuilder::timeout()] [Transaction expiry bypass] Can a very long timeout be used to keep expired transactions in memory, potentially causing them to be resubmitted after they should have been discarded? (Low)",
