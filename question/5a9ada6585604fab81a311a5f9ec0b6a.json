  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Invalid Curve Point Attack] Does the deserialization validate that decoded elliptic curve points lie on the correct BLS12-381 curve, or can an attacker submit points on an invalid curve with weaker discrete log security to break DKG protocols and compromise validator private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Small Subgroup Attack] Does Validate::Yes in line 23 properly check that deserialized G1Affine/G2Affine points are in the prime-order subgroup, or can an attacker inject small-order points to leak private key bits through pairing operations in DKG transcripts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Point at Infinity Bypass] Can an attacker deserialize the point at infinity (identity element) and use it to create invalid DKG shares that pass validation but produce zero secrets, allowing them to compromise distributed key generation and steal validator signing keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Twist Attack] Does the validation prevent accepting points on the quadratic/sextic twist of BLS12-381 G2, which could allow an attacker to perform invalid curve attacks during pairing operations and break BLS signature aggregation in consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Coordinate Field Validation] Does deserialization verify that point coordinates are within the valid field modulus for BLS12-381, or can out-of-range values cause arithmetic overflows in subsequent cryptographic operations leading to signature forgery?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Malleability Attack] Can an attacker provide multiple different serialized representations that deserialize to the same point (due to compression or encoding ambiguity), enabling transcript malleability attacks in PVSS protocols that rely on canonical serialization for uniqueness?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Memory Exhaustion DoS] Can an attacker craft malicious serialized data that causes the deserializer to allocate unbounded memory during point reconstruction, leading to OOM crashes that halt consensus or DKG ceremonies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Integer Overflow in Size Parsing] Does the deserializer properly validate size prefixes in the byte stream before allocation, or can integer overflows in size calculations lead to heap corruption when processing crafted inputs?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_se()] [Serialization Buffer Overflow] When serializing large elliptic curve points in ark_se() at line 13, can the vec![] buffer overflow if serialize_with_mode() writes more bytes than expected, potentially leaking sensitive key material from adjacent memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Panic in Deserializer] If deserialize_with_mode() panics due to malformed input instead of returning an error at line 23, can an attacker crash validator nodes during DKG by broadcasting panic-inducing payloads, causing consensus liveness failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/shared/ark_serialize.rs] [Function: ark_de()] [Error Message Information Leak] Do the error messages returned via map_err at line 24 leak sensitive information about internal cryptographic state or validation logic that attackers could use to refine their attacks?
