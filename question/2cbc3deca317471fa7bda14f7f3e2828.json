  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Array Bounds Violation] At line 24, shard_id is used to index into remote_shard_addresses without bounds checking - can an attacker provide a shard_id >= remote_shard_addresses.len() to trigger a panic and crash the executor process, causing loss of liveness for the entire shard? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a num_shards value close to usize::MAX to cause integer overflow when creating internal data structures in ExecutorService, leading to memory corruption or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [State Inconsistency] If shard_id >= num_shards, does the system properly reject initialization, or can this create inconsistent state where a shard operates outside the expected shard range, breaking cross-shard dependency resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Underflow] Can num_shards be set to 0, causing division-by-zero or underflow errors in partitioning logic when transactions are distributed across shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Array Length Mismatch] If remote_shard_addresses.len() != num_shards, can this create a mismatch where some shards are unreachable or multiple shards map to the same address, breaking execution correctness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can num_threads be set to an extremely large value (e.g., usize::MAX) to exhaust system resources when creating the executor thread pool, causing OOM kills and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Address Spoofing] Can coordinator_address be set to a malicious server controlled by an attacker, allowing interception or manipulation of execution commands and results between coordinator and shards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [SSRF via Socket Address] Can remote_shard_addresses contain internal network addresses or localhost variants that enable Server-Side Request Forgery attacks to probe or attack internal infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Duplicate Shard Addresses] If multiple entries in remote_shard_addresses point to the same socket address, can this cause shards to receive duplicate execution requests, leading to non-deterministic state and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Self-Address Validation] At line 24, self_address is extracted from remote_shard_addresses[shard_id] - can an attacker manipulate the address array such that self_address != the actual binding address, causing network misconfiguration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Race Condition in Concurrency Level] At line 34, AptosVM::set_concurrency_level_once() uses OnceCell - if multiple ProcessExecutorService instances are created concurrently, can a race condition allow the first caller to set an adversarial concurrency level that affects all subsequent executions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Concurrency Level Mismatch] If different shards set different num_threads values and the first shard to call set_concurrency_level_once() wins, can this create execution non-determinism where shards use different parallelism levels, breaking state root agreement? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero Threads Attack] Can num_threads be set to 0, and if set_concurrency_level_once() allows it, does this cause AptosVM to use 0 concurrency level, completely blocking transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource Starvation] If num_threads is set to 1 when the system expects high parallelism, can this intentionally degrade performance to cause validator timeout penalties or consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Determinism Violation] Since set_concurrency_level_once() caps concurrency at min(num_threads, num_cpus::get()), can variations in CPU count across validator hardware lead to different execution behavior and state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Uninitialized State Access] Between lines 35-42 where ExecutorService is created, and line 43 where it starts, can another thread access the partially initialized ProcessExecutorService and trigger use-after-free or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Start Failure Handling] At line 43, executor_service.start() is called without error checking - if start() fails internally, does the ProcessExecutorService still return successfully, creating a non-functional shard? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Network Controller Lifecycle] Since ExecutorService creates a NetworkController, if the controller fails to bind to the socket (port already in use), does initialization fail gracefully or leave the shard in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Thread Spawn Failure] If the thread spawned by executor_service.start() fails (line 62-66 in remote_executor_service.rs shows thread::Builder::spawn with expect), can this panic crash the entire process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Cross-Shard Communication Setup] If ExecutorService initialization creates cross-shard network channels but some remote shards are unreachable, does initialization still succeed, causing later execution to fail silently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Metrics Collector Race] At line 29, register_node_metrics_collector(None) is called - can concurrent ProcessExecutorService creations cause race conditions in global metrics registration, leading to metric loss or corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Metrics Pusher Resource Leak] At line 30-32, MetricsPusher is created but stored in _ (dropped immediately) - does this cause metrics to never be pushed, hiding critical execution failures from monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Shard ID in Metrics] The metrics pusher uses shard_id.to_string() in the name - can a malicious shard_id (e.g., very large number) cause metrics label cardinality explosion, leading to memory exhaustion in the metrics system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: new()] [Information Disclosure via Metrics] Does MetricsPusher expose sensitive information about shard topology, execution state, or transaction counts that could aid in targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/process_executor_service.rs] [Function: shutdown()] [Double Shutdown] At line 48, shutdown() calls executor_service.shutdown() - if shutdown() is called twice, can this cause double-free, use-after-free, or panic in the NetworkController shutdown logic?
