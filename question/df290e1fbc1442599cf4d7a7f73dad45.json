  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Signature bypass] Can an implementation of validate_transaction() fail to properly verify transaction signatures before executing the prologue, allowing unsigned transactions to pass validation and execute on-chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Replay attack] Does the trait contract enforce sequence number validation in implementations, or can an attacker replay previously validated transactions with the same sequence number across different validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Gas limit bypass] Can implementations of validate_transaction() be exploited to accept transactions with insufficient gas limits that would fail during execution, causing DoS by filling blocks with failing transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Module storage inconsistency] If the module_storage parameter provides inconsistent or stale module data, can this cause validation to succeed on one validator but fail on another, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [State view race condition] Can concurrent modifications to the StateView during validate_transaction() cause time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities where validation passes but execution fails due to changed state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Prologue execution determinism] Are implementations required to ensure deterministic prologue execution, or can non-deterministic behavior in validate_transaction() cause different validators to reach different VMValidatorResult outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker craft transactions that pass validation but consume excessive resources during prologue execution, causing validator nodes to slow down or crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Size validation bypass] Does the trait contract enforce transaction size limits in the 'check size and gas' phase, or can oversized transactions bypass validation and cause memory exhaustion during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Invalid sender bypass] Can validate_transaction() implementations fail to check sender account existence or validity, allowing transactions from non-existent accounts to enter the transaction pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMValidator::validate_transaction()] [Gas price manipulation] Can an attacker exploit validate_transaction() by submitting transactions with manipulated gas prices that differ from on-chain gas pricing, causing economic exploits or transaction ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [State consistency violation] Can execute_block() implementations fail to maintain state consistency when processing transactions, allowing state divergence between validators and breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Transaction output length mismatch] The trait requires output vector length to match input transaction count, but can implementations violate this by skipping transactions without providing empty outputs, causing indexing errors and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Block limit bypass] Can execute_block() implementations ignore the BlockExecutorConfigFromOnchain limits and execute more transactions than allowed, causing block size violations and network fragmentation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Transaction ordering manipulation] Can Byzantine validators reorder transactions within execute_block() to front-run or extract MEV, violating transaction fairness guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Parallel execution race condition] Does execute_block() properly handle concurrent transaction execution in Block-STM, or can race conditions cause non-deterministic state updates across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Gas charging inconsistency] Can execute_block() implementations charge different gas amounts for identical transactions across validators, causing state divergence in account balances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Empty output handling] For skipped/discarded transactions that should have empty outputs, can implementations produce non-empty outputs that corrupt the output vector structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [StateView mutation during execution] Can execute_block() implementations improperly mutate the state_view parameter before all transactions complete, violating atomicity and causing partial state application?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [Transaction slice metadata manipulation] Can malicious validators provide false TransactionSliceMetadata to execute_block() to alter execution behavior and gain unfair advantages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block()] [VMStatus error handling] When execute_block() returns Err(VMStatus), are partial state changes properly rolled back, or can failed block execution leave the state in an inconsistent intermediate state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Trait: VMBlockExecutor::new()] [Initialization state corruption] The documentation warns about cached state validity - can an attacker exploit improper cache initialization in new() to cause stale data from previous executions to affect new block execution?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/lib.rs] [Function: VMBlockExecutor::execute_block_no_limit()] [Unknown state metadata risk] The function uses TransactionSliceMetadata::unknown() - can this cause incorrect execution optimizations that lead to different results compared to execute_block() with proper metadata?
