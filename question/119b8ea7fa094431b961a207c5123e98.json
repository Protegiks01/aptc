  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Bootstrap vulnerability] At line 147, starting_version is used only when progress file doesn't exist - can an attacker delete progress files to force reversion to potentially stale starting_version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Unsigned version arithmetic] At line 94, version += 1000 has no overflow check - after processing u64::MAX/1000 files, can version wrap to 0, causing the checker to restart verification from the beginning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Asymmetric error handling] At lines 61-75, missing files trigger a continue with sleep, but other errors propagate - can an attacker exploit this difference to cause selective error handling bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Deterministic sleep] At lines 73 and 85, sleep durations are fixed (30s, 120s) - can an attacker use these predictable delays to time other attacks or cause systematic verification gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: download_file()] [Generic deserialization] At line 188, the generic function has no type constraints beyond DeserializeOwned - can type confusion vulnerabilities arise if called with unexpected types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Silent failure modes] If both buckets are empty or both have identical corruption, the checker would sleep indefinitely at line 73 without raising alerts - is this acceptable or a critical monitoring gap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Global: FILE_DIFF_COUNTER] [Metric reliability] At lines 11-17, the counter uses Lazy initialization - if this fails, can the rest of the system continue without metrics, hiding critical differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: init()] [Error message information leak] At lines 137-139 and 153-155, error messages reveal internal chain_id values - can this information be used for reconnaissance or targeting specific chains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-file-checker/src/processor.rs] [Function: run()] [Version sequence assumption] The code assumes versions always increment by 1000 - if transaction batching changes or files are uploaded out of order, can this cause systematic verification failures or skips? (High)"
