  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Pattern] [Error Swallowing] Are there code paths that catch StateViewError and convert it to a default value (like treating NotFound as empty resource), potentially masking critical storage failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Pattern] [Retry Logic] If callers implement retry logic for StateViewError, can this amplify storage layer issues causing cascading failures across the validator network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Pattern] [Error Bubbling] When StateViewError bubbles through multiple abstraction layers (StateView -> VM -> Executor -> Consensus), can error context be lost making root cause analysis impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Pattern] [Panic vs Error] Are there cases where StateViewError should trigger panics (unrecoverable) versus graceful error returns, and is this distinction properly enforced? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Pattern] [Error Logging] Does error logging for StateViewError include sufficient context (transaction hash, block height, state key) to diagnose consensus issues without leaking sensitive data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [VM] [Resource Loading] When Move VM loads resources and encounters StateViewError, can this cause the VM to execute with partially loaded module dependencies leading to type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [VM] [Module Loading] If StateViewError occurs while loading Move modules during transaction execution, can cached modules from previous transactions cause incorrect bytecode to execute? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [VM] [Global Storage] Does StateViewError in global storage operations properly distinguish between Move's 'exists' semantics versus storage-level existence, preventing borrow violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [VM] [Type Arguments] When deserializing resources with type arguments, can BcsError mask type parameter mismatches that would allow type confusion attacks in Move? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [VM] [Aggregator Access] For aggregator V1/V2 state access in parallel execution, can StateViewError cause aggregator reads to return inconsistent values violating aggregator semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Governance] [Proposal Execution] If StateViewError occurs while reading governance proposals during on-chain execution, can this block governance upgrades causing permanent network stagnation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Governance] [Voting Power] Can StateViewError while reading stake pool balances cause incorrect voting power calculation, allowing minority stakeholders to pass malicious proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Staking] [Reward Distribution] If StateViewError prevents reading validator performance metrics, can rewards be distributed incorrectly or skipped, violating economic security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Staking] [Validator Set] When reading validator set during epoch changes, can StateViewError cause incomplete validator updates leading to consensus participation issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Staking] [Slashing] If StateViewError prevents reading evidence of validator misbehavior, can malicious validators avoid slashing penalties? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Proof] [State Proof Generation] When generating state proofs for light clients, can StateViewError cause incomplete proofs that pass verification but represent invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Proof] [Merkle Path] If StateViewError occurs while building Merkle paths, can this cause proof generation to succeed with fabricated intermediate nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Proof] [Proof Verification] When verifying state proofs against committed roots, can StateViewError mask proof forgery attempts by treating verification failures as storage errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Proof] [Batch Verification] In batch state proof verification, can one StateViewError cause the entire batch to be rejected even if other proofs are valid, enabling DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Testing] [Mock Implementations] Do test mock implementations of TStateView return realistic StateViewError patterns, or can production bugs be masked by unrealistic test error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Testing] [Error Injection] Are there systematic error injection tests that verify all StateViewError paths in transaction execution maintain consensus safety? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty String] Can StateViewError::NotFound or Other with empty strings cause parsing errors or ambiguous error messages in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode] Do NotFound and Other string variants handle Unicode state keys safely without truncation or encoding issues that could mask different errors as identical? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/errors.rs] [Edge Case] [Error Chains] When BcsError wraps another error with #[from] at line 15, is the full error chain preserved for debugging, or can critical root causes be lost? (Low)"
