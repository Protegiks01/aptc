  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Line 100] [Bind Error Handling] If TcpListener::bind() fails due to port already in use, does the error message leak sensitive information about which process is using the port, or does it provide generic errors that prevent reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Lines 94-96] [Migration Error Silencing] The run_migrations() call lacks explicit error handling - if migrations fail silently without panicking, does the service continue with an outdated schema, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities patched in newer migrations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Line 101] [Server Panic Recovery] If the axum::serve() call panics during request handling, does the panic propagate up to run() causing the entire service to crash, or are panics caught and recovered, potentially allowing the service to continue in a corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Line 88] [Config Logging GDPR] The config is logged with {:?} formatting - does this violate GDPR or privacy regulations by logging personally identifiable information embedded in configuration fields, exposing user data to unauthorized log consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Lines 90-96] [Log Injection] The info!() macro calls use string interpolation - can an attacker inject malicious content into database_url or other config fields that gets executed as log format string attacks when logs are parsed by monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Lines 87-104] [Audit Trail Gap] Critical operations like database connections and migrations are logged, but successful context building and server startup lack corresponding audit logs - does this prevent detection of configuration tampering or unauthorized service restarts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: get_server_name(), Lines 106-114] [Server Name Enumeration] The function returns static string names based on ServerConfig variants - can an attacker use this to enumerate available service types and target specific vulnerabilities in each service implementation based on the exposed names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: get_server_name(), Lines 106-114] [Name Collision] If multiple instances run with the same server_name, does this cause conflicts in service discovery, metrics collection, or distributed tracing systems, potentially masking security incidents by attributing them to the wrong service instance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Enum: ServerContext, Line 48] [Enum Size Imbalance] ServerContext variants have different memory sizes - can this cause memory layout issues or padding vulnerabilities when contexts are stored in collections or transmitted across FFI boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Struct: NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig, Lines 40-46] [String Memory DoS] The database_url field is a String without length limits - can an attacker provide an extremely long URL (gigabytes) to cause heap exhaustion when the config is cloned across context creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: build_context(), Lines 58-82] [Clone Safety Verification] Multiple config.clone() calls occur - do all nested config structs (ParserConfig, AssetUploaderWorkerConfig, etc.) implement Clone safely without invoking unsafe code that could cause use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Struct: NFTMetadataCrawlerConfig, Lines 40-46] [Configuration Persistence] Does the config get persisted to disk after validation, or can an attacker modify the config file while the service is running, causing divergence between the in-memory config and file-based config that leads to inconsistent behavior after restarts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: run(), Lines 87-104] [Hot Reload Race] If the service supports hot reloading configurations, can an attacker trigger a config reload while run() is executing, causing race conditions where the server uses partially updated config values leading to inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Imports: Lines 15-18] [Diesel Version Vulnerabilities] The code imports diesel r2d2 connection management - are there known CVEs in the specific diesel or r2d2 versions used that could allow SQL injection, connection hijacking, or authentication bypass through crafted database_url parameters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Type: Pool<ConnectionManager<PgConnection>>, Lines 16-17] [Connection Manager Vulnerabilities] The PgConnection type is used for PostgreSQL - does the connection manager properly handle TLS/SSL configuration, or can an attacker force downgrade to unencrypted connections by manipulating database_url parameters like sslmode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/config.rs] [Function: build_context(), Lines 58-82] [Connection Leak] If context construction fails after obtaining database connections from the pool, are connections properly returned to the pool, or do they leak, eventually exhausting the pool and causing service-wide database unavailability? (Medium)"
