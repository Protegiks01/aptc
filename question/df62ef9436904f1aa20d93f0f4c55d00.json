  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/config.rs] [Struct: MetricsServerConfig] [Hot Reload] If configuration hot-reloading is supported, could rapid changes to listen_address or listen_port cause race conditions, port exhaustion, or binding failures that crash the faucet service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/config.rs] [Struct: MetricsServerConfig] [Partial Updates] During config updates, if only some fields are changed (e.g., just listen_port), could partial application of configuration create inconsistent states where the server binds to old_address:new_port or new_address:old_port? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/config.rs] [Default: '0.0.0.0'] [Cloud Metadata] In cloud environments, does binding to 0.0.0.0 expose the metrics endpoint to cloud metadata services (169.254.169.254 on AWS/GCP/Azure) that could be exploited via SSRF to extract instance credentials or sensitive cloud configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/config.rs] [Field: listen_address] [Load Balancer Bypass] If the faucet is deployed behind a load balancer or reverse proxy, could configuring listen_address to bind directly to a public IP bypass the proxy's security controls (WAF, rate limiting, authentication)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/metrics-server/src/config.rs] [Field: listen_port] [Kubernetes Conflict] In Kubernetes deployments, could port conflicts between the default 9101 and other pods/services in the same namespace cause the metrics server to fail, leaving the faucet unmonitored and vulnerable to undetected attacks? (Low)"
