  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Struct: AdminServiceConfig] [Authentication bypass] Can an attacker enable the admin service on mainnet with an empty authentication_configs vector by directly deserializing malicious YAML, bypassing the sanitize() check that only runs after deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: authentication_configs] [Authentication bypass] Since authentication_configs is a Vec that allows multiple PasscodeSha256 entries, can an attacker exploit a race condition where configs are modified between sanitize() and service startup to remove all authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [Cryptographic weakness] Does PasscodeSha256 use unsalted SHA256 hashes for passcode verification, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks if hashed passcodes are leaked from config files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [Information disclosure] Since PasscodeSha256 authentication requires passcodes in query parameters (e.g., /profilez?passcode=abc), are these passcodes logged in HTTP access logs or proxy logs, exposing authentication credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Logic error] Can an attacker bypass mainnet authentication requirements by setting enabled to Some(false) during sanitize() but then changing it to Some(true) after sanitization completes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Chain ID spoofing] Does sanitize() properly validate the chain_id parameter, or can a malicious node operator provide a fake ChainId to bypass mainnet authentication requirements and enable unauthenticated admin access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Conditional check] The sanitization only checks authentication when enabled == Some(true), but can an attacker set enabled to None to bypass both sanitize() and later enable the service through optimize() without authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [State inconsistency] Can the optimize() function enable admin_service on mainnet without authentication if sanitize() is not called first, or if sanitize() runs before optimize() sets enabled to Some(true)?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Logic error] Does optimize() at line 95-96 correctly determine mainnet by checking !chain_id.is_mainnet(), or can this logic be inverted through integer overflow or type confusion in the ChainId implementation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Configuration tampering] Since optimize() sets enabled based on chain_id at line 100, can an attacker modify the chain_id after optimization but before service startup to enable unauthenticated admin access on mainnet?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [Configuration validation] Is there validation to prevent binding to public IP addresses or ensuring localhost-only binding on production nodes, or can operators accidentally expose admin endpoints to the internet?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: port] [Port collision] Can the default port 9102 at line 46 conflict with other services, causing the admin service to fail silently while config shows it as enabled, leading operators to believe they have monitoring when they don't? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: randomize_ports()] [Port range] Does randomize_ports() restrict port selection to privileged ports (< 1024) or known service ports, potentially causing conflicts or allowing privilege escalation through port rebinding attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: malloc_stats_max_len] [Buffer overflow] Can an attacker set malloc_stats_max_len to usize::MAX at line 48, causing integer overflow when allocating buffers in the /malloc/stats endpoint, leading to heap corruption or OOM crashes?
