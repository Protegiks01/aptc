  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: post_logs()] [Content-type missing] Request sets CONTENT_ENCODING but doesn't explicitly set Content-Type - can this cause server-side parsing errors or security issues with ambiguous content interpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: post_custom_metrics()] [JSON serialization] Uses .json::<TelemetryDump>() which automatically serializes - can extremely large TelemetryDump objects cause memory exhaustion during serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Key material handling] Private keys are accessed via noise_config reference - is key material properly zeroized from memory after use, or can it leak through memory dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Handshake message length] client_noise_msg buffer is pre-allocated to noise::handshake_init_msg_len(0) - can incorrect length calculations cause buffer overflows or underflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Prologue size constants] CHAIN_ID_LENGTH, ID_SIZE, PROLOGUE_SIZE are hardcoded - can changes to ChainId or PeerId types cause size mismatches leading to memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [JWT validation] Received JWT token is converted from bytes without validation - can malformed UTF-8 in response cause String::from_utf8() to fail or inject invalid characters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Cryptographic downgrade] Noise protocol configuration is derived from NodeConfig - can downgrade attacks force weak cryptographic parameters during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: server_public_key()] [Key rotation] Server public key is cached indefinitely until reset_token() - if server rotates keys, can validators continue using stale keys leading to authentication failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: try_push_prometheus_metrics()] [Async cancellation] If async task is cancelled mid-execution, can partially compressed metrics or partial authentication state corrupt future telemetry sends? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: try_send_logs()] [Fire-and-forget pattern] Errors are logged but not propagated - can this hide systematic failures where logs never reach telemetry service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: send_authenticated_request()] [Async executor starvation] Long-running compression in push_prometheus_metrics() blocks async executor - can this cause telemetry operations to prevent consensus message processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Async state corruption] Multiple concurrent authenticate() calls may race - can this cause noise protocol state machines to interfere with each other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: new()] [ChainId tampering] chain_id is stored from initialization without validation - can malicious configurations specify arbitrary chain_ids to send telemetry to wrong chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [ChainId size assumption] CHAIN_ID_LENGTH is hardcoded as 1 - if ChainId type changes to use more bytes, can this cause prologue construction to corrupt memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [PeerId boundary] prologue[CHAIN_ID_LENGTH..ID_SIZE] copies PeerId - can PeerId::LENGTH constant mismatch with actual peer_id bytes cause incorrect prologue authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: new()] [PeerId::ZERO default] Defaults to PeerId::ZERO if unavailable - can multiple validators with ZERO peer_id collide in telemetry service, mixing their data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: new()] [Retry exhaustion] RetryTransientMiddleware retries for 10 seconds total - can this cause validator operations to hang for extended periods if telemetry service is down? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: send_authenticated_request()] [Manual retry conflict] Function implements manual retry on 401 - does this conflict with RetryTransientMiddleware, potentially causing double retries or inconsistent behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: send_authenticated_request()] [Retry amplification] On UNAUTHORIZED, retries once without backoff - can rapid repeated auth failures cause authentication stampede to telemetry service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: push_prometheus_metrics()] [Metrics exposure] All Prometheus metrics are sent - can sensitive validator state or transaction information leak through metrics that shouldn't be exposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: post_logs()] [Log content] Logs are sent in batches without filtering - can validators accidentally send sensitive information (private keys, transaction details) in logs to telemetry service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: authenticate()] [Handshake exposure] Noise handshake messages are sent over network - is the connection using TLS, or can handshake be intercepted despite Noise protocol's security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Function: post_custom_metrics()] [Custom data leakage] TelemetryDump can contain arbitrary params - can validators be tricked into sending sensitive data through custom telemetry events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Tests: lines 420-675] [Test coverage gaps] Tests mock server responses but don't test actual Noise protocol handshake - can real-world authentication failures occur that aren't caught by tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/sender.rs] [Tests: test_try_send_metrics_retry_unauthorized] [Behavior mismatch] Test expects 1 hit but doesn't verify the automatic retry on 401 - does test accurately reflect production retry behavior? (Low)"
