  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious output_path like '../../../etc/passwd' or '/etc/sensitive_config' to write diagnostic output to arbitrary system files, potentially overwriting critical validator configuration or key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Does the write() method validate that output_path doesn't contain directory traversal sequences (../, ..\\, absolute paths), allowing attackers to escape intended output directories and corrupt blockchain state files or validator private keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Can output_path accept UNC paths (\\\\\\\\server\\\\share) or network paths on Windows, enabling remote file write attacks that could compromise validator network isolation or leak sensitive diagnostic data to attacker-controlled servers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Are there checks preventing output_path from targeting special files like /dev/null, /dev/random, or named pipes that could cause resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior in validator monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Path Traversal] Does output_path validation prevent writing to system directories like /proc, /sys, or /dev that could manipulate kernel behavior or validator process memory on Linux systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] Can an attacker create a symbolic link at the output_path location pointing to sensitive validator files (like consensus safety data or private keys), causing write() to follow the symlink and corrupt critical blockchain security state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] Does std::fs::write() in OutputArgs::write() check for symlinks before writing, or will it blindly follow symlinks created by malicious users sharing the filesystem with validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] If output_path is a symlink to a world-writable directory or socket, can this be exploited to leak validator diagnostic data to unauthorized processes or enable privilege escalation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] Are there protections against time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) races where an attacker replaces output_path with a symlink between path validation and the actual write operation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Symlink Attack] Can hardlinks be used similarly to symlinks to redirect write operations to unintended files, bypassing any symlink-specific protections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permissions] Does write() set secure file permissions (e.g., 0600) on newly created output files, or does it use default umask that could make validator diagnostic data world-readable, exposing sensitive node configuration or performance metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permissions] If output_path points to an existing file owned by root or another user, will std::fs::write() fail safely or could it lead to privilege escalation or denial of service scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permissions] Can an attacker pre-create output_path with world-writable permissions, then monitor writes to steal validator performance data or diagnostic information that reveals consensus timing vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permissions] Are there checks ensuring the parent directory of output_path has appropriate permissions, preventing attackers from using sticky bit directories to hijack output files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [File Permissions] Does the write operation respect filesystem ACLs and SELinux contexts, or could it bypass security policies on hardened validator systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability where an attacker can replace output_path with a malicious file between when the path is resolved and when std::fs::write() actually opens it, redirecting output to critical validator files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Race Condition] If multiple node-checker instances run concurrently with the same output_path, can race conditions cause partial writes, data corruption, or mixed output that breaks JSON/YAML parsing in monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Race Condition] Does write() use atomic file operations (write-to-temp-then-rename) or does it directly overwrite files, risking data loss if the process crashes mid-write during critical validator health checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent writes from multiple threads cause filesystem-level corruption or undefined behavior if OutputArgs is shared across threads without proper synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Race Condition] Is there a risk of deadlock or race conditions if write() is called from async contexts while another task is reading from the same file? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker supply an extremely long output string that causes write() to exhaust disk space on the validator node, potentially causing consensus failures or blockchain state corruption due to insufficient storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does write() enforce any size limits on the output parameter before writing to disk, or can it be exploited to fill validator storage with gigabytes of diagnostic data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] If output_path points to a network filesystem or slow storage device, can write() block indefinitely, causing validator health checks to hang and appear as node failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] Are there protections against writing to full filesystems that could cause cascading failures in validator monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/mod.rs] [Function: OutputArgs::write()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can repeated writes to the same output_path with large data trigger I/O throttling or wear out SSDs, affecting validator performance? (Low)"
