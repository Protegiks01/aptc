  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Function: new()] [API Misunderstanding] Can developers mistakenly believe new() returns a fully-initialized config ready for use, when in fact num_shards=0 makes it invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Builder Pattern] [Required Fields] Does the builder pattern enforce that required fields (num_shards) are set before build() can be called, or can build() be called on incomplete configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/sharded_block_partitioner/config.rs] [Field: cross_shard_dep_avoid_threshold] [Dependency Resolution] Can manipulating the threshold cause the partitioner to incorrectly classify cross-shard dependencies, allowing conflicting transactions to execute in parallel and causing state corruption?
