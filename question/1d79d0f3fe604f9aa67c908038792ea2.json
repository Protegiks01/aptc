  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [Unused Result] augment_pubkey() returns anyhow::Result but just returns Ok(pk) at line 68 - are there cases where this should return Err? Can callers incorrectly assume validation occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: derive_eval()] [Infallible Result] derive_eval() returns anyhow::Result but always returns Ok at line 152 - do callers expect validation to potentially fail? Can this mask errors in other WeightedVUF implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Threshold enforcement] aggregate_shares() doesn't check if the provided players meet the reconstruction threshold - can an attacker aggregate shares from arbitrary subset and produce a proof that passes verify_proof()?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Per-share threshold] Does verify_share() validate that apk contains enough shares to meet a threshold? Or can any subset of shares pass verification allowing threshold violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Sybil multiplication] Can a Byzantine validator appear multiple times in apks_and_proofs with different Player IDs but same keys to amplify their shares beyond their actual weight? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicParameters] [Serialization safety] PublicParameters derives Serialize/Deserialize at line 24 - can a maliciously crafted serialized blob deserialize to invalid group elements that break pairing equations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Type: ProofShare] [Deserialization bounds] ProofShare is Vec<G1Projective> - is there a maximum size enforced during deserialization? Can attackers send multi-gigabyte ProofShare vectors causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Type: PubKeyShare] [Recursive structures] PubKeyShare contains Vec<DealtPubKeyShare> - can deeply nested or cyclic serialized structures cause stack overflow during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Thread_rng safety] Line 87 uses thread_rng() which maintains thread-local state - if multiple threads call verify_share() concurrently, can RNG state corruption cause identical random scalars to be generated, reducing security?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Overall design] [Key reuse across ceremonies] If the same PubKey and SecretKey are reused across multiple DKG ceremonies with different WeightedConfigBlstrs, can cross-ceremony proof forgery occur? (High)"
