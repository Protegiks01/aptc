(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/validate.rs] [Function: validate()] [Missing Path Sanitization] Does the function sanitize or normalize the PathBuf input before use, or can attackers exploit path canonicalization bugs (e.g., '/./././file.yaml') to bypass security checks?
