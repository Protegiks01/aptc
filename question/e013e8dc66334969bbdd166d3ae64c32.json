  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [Privilege escalation] Does the debugger tool enforce access controls on who can execute it, or can any user with command-line access read sensitive validator state, pending transactions, or consensus data from AptosDB? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Database access] Does Cmd::run() verify that the user has legitimate permission to access AptosDB before executing database operations, or can unauthorized operators extract entire blockchain state including private validator information? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [File permissions] Are proper file system permissions enforced on the debugger binary and its accessed databases, or can unprivileged users execute the debugger to bypass normal API access controls and directly query/modify validator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Audit logging] Does the debugger log all operations (database queries, transaction decoding, consensus data access) for security auditing, or can attackers perform forensics-resistant attacks by using the debugger to cover their tracks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Database corruption] When Cmd::run() invokes AptosDb subcommand, can malformed inputs cause database corruption that affects running validator nodes, potentially causing state fork or consensus failure requiring network-wide recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Consensus interference] Can the DumpPendingTxns subcommand executed via Cmd::run() interfere with live consensus operations by holding locks, modifying pending transaction state, or causing race conditions with the consensus engine? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Transaction replay] Does the Decode subcommand properly validate transaction signatures and sequence numbers, or can attackers use it to craft replayed/forged transactions that bypass normal validation when re-injected into the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Move VM bypass] Can the Move subcommand be exploited to execute arbitrary Move bytecode outside the normal gas metering and safety checks, potentially allowing attackers to test exploits against the Move VM before deploying them on-chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14-19] [Database lock contention] Can concurrent executions of the debugger tool cause database lock contention or deadlocks that prevent validator nodes from committing state, resulting in consensus liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [State snapshot consistency] Does Cmd::run() ensure consistent state snapshots when reading AptosDB, or can race conditions with live validator operations cause debugger to observe partial/inconsistent state leading to incorrect security analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14-19] [Async cancellation safety] If SIGTERM/SIGINT is sent during Cmd::run().await execution, are in-flight database transactions properly rolled back, or can interrupted operations leave database in inconsistent state requiring manual repair? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 17] [Metrics resource leak] Is the MetricsPusher properly cleaned up on error paths, or can failures during Cmd::parse() or Cmd::run() cause metrics threads to leak consuming system resources over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Logger resource leak] Does Logger::init() properly handle reinitialization attempts, or can repeated debugger invocations cause logger handle leaks that exhaust file descriptors affecting validator node operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 14-19] [Memory exhaustion] Can attackers trigger memory-intensive operations through Cmd::run() (large transaction decoding, full database scans) that exhaust available RAM causing validator node OOM kills and consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 19] [Timing side channel] Does Cmd::run() execution time vary based on secret data (private keys, validator credentials), allowing attackers to infer information through repeated timing measurements of debugger operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [Process listing exposure] Can an attacker monitor running processes to detect when the debugger is active and correlate with specific validator operations, potentially identifying optimal timing for attacks or inferring sensitive debugging activities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 11-12] [jemallocator vulnerability] Does the jemallocator crate have known security vulnerabilities, and are updates properly tracked to prevent exploitation of allocator bugs that could compromise validator node memory safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 8] [clap parsing vulnerability] Are there vulnerabilities in the clap::Parser implementation that could allow command injection, buffer overflow, or denial of service through crafted command-line arguments passed to Cmd::parse()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 6] [Logger vulnerability] Does the aptos_logger crate properly handle malformed log messages or format strings, or can attackers exploit logger vulnerabilities to achieve code execution or information disclosure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [Binary tampering] Are proper code signing and integrity checks performed on the debugger binary to prevent attackers from replacing it with a malicious version that exfiltrates validator data or injects malicious transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [Environment variable injection] Can attackers manipulate environment variables (RUST_LOG, TOKIO_*, MALLOC_*) to alter debugger behavior, bypass security controls, or enable additional functionality that exposes sensitive validator information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-debugger/src/main.rs] [Line: 1-20] [Container escape] If the debugger runs in a containerized environment, can it be exploited to escape container isolation and access the host system where validator keys or other critical data may be stored? (High)"
