  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: PayloadPullParameters] [Stack Size] Is PayloadPullParameters size reasonable for stack allocation, or can large embedded structures (PayloadFilter, HashSet) cause stack overflow in deep call chains? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: PayloadPullParameters] [Missing Serde] Since PayloadPullParameters doesn't derive Serialize/Deserialize, how are these parameters propagated across network boundaries without serialization? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: exclude_authors] [Denial of Service] Can a malicious proposer exclude all active batch producers through exclude_authors, forcing the network to operate with empty blocks and degraded throughput? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Optional Bypass] When maybe_optqs_payload_pull_params is None, are there fallback exclusion mechanisms, or can this allow banned authors to participate in payload contribution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns_after_filtering] [Saturating Arithmetic] Are operations with max_txns_after_filtering using saturating arithmetic, or can unchecked additions/subtractions with transaction counts cause overflow/underflow?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter] [Clone Semantics] When user_txn_filter.clone() is called in the polling loop, does this deep clone all transaction summaries or batch info, potentially causing stale filter data? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Future Timestamp] Can setting block_timestamp far in the future (beyond current time + max_poll_time) cause confusion in payload age calculations that breaks batch selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: pending_ordering and pending_uncommitted_blocks] [State Transition] Can incorrect state transitions where pending_ordering changes but pending_uncommitted_blocks doesn't update cause validators to make conflicting decisions?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Integration: Multiple Validators] [Non-Determinism] Can differences in how multiple validators construct PayloadPullParameters (due to slightly different local state) cause them to pull different payloads for the same round? (Critical)",
