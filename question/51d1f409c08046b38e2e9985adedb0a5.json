  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: check_api_output_enabled()] [Partial disable] If one output format is disabled, can attackers use the other format to exfiltrate data that should be restricted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_accumulator_root_hash()] [Hash consistency] Does the function ensure the root hash matches the transaction proof, preventing state proof forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_accumulator_root_hash()] [Version synchronization] Can the function return a hash from a different version than requested due to race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_oldest_version_and_block_height()] [Pruning race] Can get_first_viable_block return a block that gets pruned immediately after, causing subsequent queries to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: get_oldest_version_and_block_height()] [Bootstrap state] During initial bootstrap, can the function return (0, 0) that causes confusion with genesis state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: max_transactions_page_size(), max_events_page_size(), etc.] [Config tampering] Can node_config.api settings be modified at runtime to bypass page size limits and enable resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: max_submit_transaction_batch_size()] [Batch size bypass] Can the limit be circumvented by submitting batches as individual transactions through multiple API calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: content_length_limit()] [Integer overflow] Does content_length_limit() properly handle u64 values that could overflow when converted to other integer types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: db_sharding_enabled()] [Config race] Can enable_storage_sharding be toggled during API operations, causing inconsistent data sources (db vs indexer)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Various functions using db_sharding_enabled] [Iterator implementation mismatch] When switching between db iterator and indexer iterator, can differences in implementation cause different ordering or content? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Field: wait_for_hash_active_connections] [Connection tracking overflow] Can wait_for_hash_active_connections overflow if too many connections are opened, wrapping AtomicUsize? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Field: wait_for_hash_active_connections] [Connection leak] If connections fail to decrement the counter on close, can this cause the counter to perpetually increase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Struct: FunctionStats] [Cache size limit] The Cache is created with size 100 - can high-cardinality function calls cause excessive eviction and loss of important statistics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/context.rs] [Function: FunctionStats::increment()] [Race condition on insert] The comment notes 'race can occur on inserting new entry, resulting in some lost data' - is this acceptable for security auditing? (Low)",
