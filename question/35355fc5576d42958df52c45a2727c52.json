  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Serialization Malleability] The Contribution struct uses BCS serialization via CryptoHasher - can an attacker craft two different Contribution instances that serialize to the same bytes, causing hash collisions in signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Generic Type Confusion] The Contribution struct is generic over Gr (group) and A (auxiliary) types - can type parameter substitution attacks provide mismatched types that satisfy trait bounds but violate cryptographic assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Auxiliary Data Tampering] The aux field of type A is generic and not cryptographically bound to comm or player - can an attacker modify aux after signature generation to change transcript semantics while maintaining valid signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Player Field Manipulation] The player field contains only a numeric ID - can an attacker forge contributions with arbitrary Player IDs if the calling code doesn't validate that Player IDs match authorized validator indices? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Commitment Field Type Safety] The comm field of generic type Gr lacks runtime validation - can an attacker provide commitments in different group instantiations (G1 vs G2) that break pairing-based verification protocols? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Hash Collision Resistance] The CryptoHasher derivation at line 19 - does it provide sufficient collision resistance for the DKG security parameter, or can birthday attacks find colliding contributions with ~2^128 operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [BCSCryptoHash Canonicalization] Does the BCSCryptoHash derivation enforce canonical encoding of group elements and scalars, or can non-canonical representations create signature malleability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Struct: Contribution] [Lifetime Elision Issues] The TODO comment at lines 17-18 mentions lifetime issues - can this cause dangling references or use-after-free bugs when Contribution instances reference deallocated memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Type: SoK] [Tuple Field Ordering] The SoK type alias defines a 4-tuple (Player, Gr, Signature, PoK) - can tuple field reordering during destructuring (lines 58, 72, 81, 97) cause fields to be swapped, mixing up player IDs, commitments, signatures and PoKs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Type: SoK] [Tuple Size Mismatch] If calling code provides tuples with fewer or more than 4 elements, does Rust's type system catch this at compile time or can dynamic dispatch allow runtime tuple size violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Type: SoK] [Generic Type Instantiation] The SoK type is generic over Gr - can mismatched group instantiations in different SoK instances within the same soks array cause type confusion during verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Type: SoK] [Memory Layout] The SoK tuple contains large cryptographic objects (Gr points, Signatures, PoKs) - can memory alignment issues cause data corruption when SoK instances are passed by value vs by reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [PoK Batch Size] The schnorr::pok_batch_verify call at line 76 processes all PoKs in one batch - can extremely large batch sizes (>10,000 validators) cause multi-exponentiation to overflow or produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [PoK Randomness Collision] If the tau parameter used for batching is reused across multiple batch_verify_soks calls, can this enable cross-batch attacks where invalid PoKs in one batch are hidden by valid PoKs in another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Schnorr Challenge Malleability] Can an attacker manipulate the Schnorr challenge computation inside pok_batch_verify by providing crafted commitments c_i that cause hash collisions in the Fiat-Shamir transform? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [PoK Verification Shortcut] If all PoKs in the batch have s=0 (zero response), does the batch verification correctly reject them or does it pass due to the multi-exp summing to identity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Generator Point Substitution] The pk_base parameter is used as the generator in PoK verification - can providing a point with unknown discrete log (nothing-up-my-sleeve point) break the soundness of the Schnorr protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Group Identity Handling] When initializing c = Gr::identity() at line 57, can subsequent operations incorrectly handle the identity element, leading to point-at-infinity exceptions or verification bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Point Compression] If the group Gr uses compressed point representation, can decompression failures for malformed points cause panics instead of graceful verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Scalar Reduction] When tau is used in pok_batch_verify for computing powers tau^i, are scalar operations performed modulo the group order, or can scalar overflow cause verification to use incorrect exponents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Subgroup Confinement] Does the verification check that all commitments c_i lie in the correct subgroup, or can low-order points be injected to break cryptographic security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Point Addition Timing] The add_assign operation at line 59 - can timing variations based on input point values leak information about validator contributions through side-channel analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Curve Twist Attack] If Gr is instantiated with BLS12-381 G1 or G2, can an attacker provide points on the twist of the curve that pass group membership checks but have different security properties? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Multi-Exp Implementation] The HasMultiExp trait used in pok_batch_verify - can the underlying g1_multi_exp/g2_multi_exp implementation have bugs when base and scalar arrays have length mismatches despite the length check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/contribution.rs] [Function: batch_verify_soks()] [Multi-Exp Overflow] When computing products of powers in multi-exponentiation, can intermediate results overflow the group representation, causing incorrect final results? (High)"
