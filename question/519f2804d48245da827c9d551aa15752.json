  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Infrastructure: Log Sampling] [Selective Logging] If log sampling is applied to reduce volume, can critical safety violations fall into sampled-out entries, causing Byzantine behavior to go undetected by monitoring systems? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Forensics: Evidence Preservation] [Chain of Custody] Do SafetyLogSchema logs provide sufficient cryptographic proof of custody to serve as legal evidence in slashing disputes, or can validators claim logs were tampered with to escape penalties? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Forensics: Timestamp Integrity] [Clock Manipulation] If system timestamps are included in logs (not visible in this file but likely added by logging framework), can validators manipulate system clocks to reorder events and hide the temporal sequence of double-signing attempts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Compliance: Data Retention] [GDPR Compliance] Does logging of Author addresses and validator identities comply with data protection regulations, or could indefinite log retention of personal identifiers create regulatory violations? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Compliance: Audit Requirements] [Regulatory Completeness] Are SafetyLogSchema logs sufficient to meet financial audit requirements for blockchain validators, or could missing fields prevent compliance with regulations requiring complete transaction audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Performance: Logging Overhead] [Timing Side Channels] Does the overhead of creating SafetyLogSchema entries and logging them introduce timing variations that leak information about consensus decisions, enabling timing-based attacks on safety rules? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Performance: Log Backpressure] [Liveness Impact] If the logging system experiences backpressure (slow writes), can this cause safety-rules operations to block or timeout, leading to loss of liveness in the consensus protocol? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Double-Signing] [Detection Completeness] When a Byzantine validator attempts to sign two different blocks at the same round, will ConstructAndSignVoteTwoChain and SignProposal logs definitively capture both signing attempts with sufficient detail to prove equivocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Epoch Manipulation] [Epoch Boundary Attacks] During epoch transitions, can attackers exploit logging gaps or inconsistencies between Epoch and Initialize log entries to hide validator set manipulation or stake redistribution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Round Rollback] [Persistent State Attacks] If an attacker gains write access to persistent storage and rolls back last_voted_round state, will LastVotedRound logs detect this tampering, or can the rollback succeed without triggering alerts? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Waypoint Forgery] [Bootstrap Attacks] Can an attacker with access to log systems forge Waypoint log entries to mislead operators during manual recovery procedures, causing them to restore to an incorrect blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Log Deletion] [Anti-Forensics] If a compromised validator deletes their safety-rules logs after committing Byzantine behavior, is there sufficient log replication or cryptographic proof elsewhere in the network to still detect and prove the violation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Attack: Log Injection] [False Evidence] Can an attacker inject fake SafetyLogSchema entries into a validator's log system to frame the validator for consensus violations they didn't commit, triggering false slashing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Error: Logging Failures] [Silent Failures] If the logging system fails to write SafetyLogSchema entries (e.g., due to disk errors), does the safety-rules module fail safely by halting operations, or does it continue processing without audit trails? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Error: Malformed Data] [Validation Gaps] When logging fields like round numbers, waypoints, or authors, are these values validated before logging to prevent malformed data from causing crashes in log parsing or analysis tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Edge Case: Maximum Values] [Integer Boundary] Can logging of maximum u64 values for rounds (approaching overflow) cause issues in log analysis tools that assume smaller numbers, leading to missed detection of consensus attacks near round number wraparound? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Epochs] [Zero-Validator Epochs] If an epoch has zero validators or invalid epoch state, will Epoch log entries capture this anomalous condition, or could missing validation allow silent failures during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Usage: Vote Construction] [Vote Safety Proof] When ConstructAndSignVoteTwoChain is logged, does it include enough information (block hash, parent hash, round, QC) to cryptographically prove the vote satisfies 2-chain voting rules, or is critical data omitted? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Usage: Proposal Signing] [Proposal Authenticity] When SignProposal events are logged, is the complete proposal content (including all transactions) hashed and included, or could a leader sign one proposal but log signing a different proposal to hide malicious transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Usage: Timeout Handling] [Timeout Certificate Validity] When SignTimeoutWithQC is logged, does the log capture the complete quorum certificate content to prove the timeout is legitimate, or could Byzantine validators forge timeout logs for non-existent QCs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Usage: State Queries] [State Consistency] When ConsensusState is logged for queries, does the logged state exactly match the persistent storage state, or can transient in-memory state be logged that doesn't reflect durable consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Monitoring: Anomaly Detection] [Pattern Recognition] Do SafetyLogSchema logs contain sufficient structured data for automated anomaly detection systems to identify Byzantine behavior patterns (e.g., unusual voting patterns, excessive timeouts), or is critical context missing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Monitoring: Real-Time Alerts] [Alert Completeness] Can monitoring systems parse SafetyLogSchema entries in real-time to detect active consensus attacks, or are there parsing ambiguities or missing fields that delay attack detection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Monitoring: Correlation] [Cross-Validator Analysis] Are SafetyLogSchema logs structured consistently across all validators to enable correlation analysis that detects when multiple validators exhibit coordinated Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/logging.rs] [Compatibility: Schema Evolution] [Version Compatibility] If the SafetyLogSchema structure evolves (adding or removing fields), will this break log analysis tools or forensic scripts that depend on the current schema structure? (Medium)"
