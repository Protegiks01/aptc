  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/configuration.rs] [Complex Attack] [Economic Attack] Can attacker manipulate max_signatures_per_txn to force users to pay excessive gas for keyless transactions extracting value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/configuration.rs] [Field Validation] [Cross-Field Invariant] Can max_commited_epk_bytes + max_iss_val_bytes + max_extra_field_bytes overflow when summed causing total size validation to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/configuration.rs] [Field Validation] [Ratio Constraint] Can ratio between max_signatures_per_txn and other limits be exploited to create transactions that pass individual checks but fail combined validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/configuration.rs] [Field Validation] [Alignment] Can misaligned field sizes (max_commited_epk_bytes=93 not power of 2) cause performance issues or buffer alignment bugs? (Low)"
