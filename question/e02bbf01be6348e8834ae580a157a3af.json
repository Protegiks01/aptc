  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Destructor race] In async contexts, can InputSecret's implicit drop happen while references from get_secret_a() are still in use, creating use-after-free scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add()] [Integer promotion] When adding scalars represented as BigUint internally, can integer promotion or conversion issues cause precision loss or incorrect results for large values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Fault injection] Can hardware fault injection (Rowhammer, voltage glitching) during InputSecret operations flip bits in the scalar field 'a' to produce attacker-controlled secrets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: PartialEq] [Equality constant-time] Does PartialEq comparison use constant-time comparison, or can timing analysis reveal when two validators generated identical InputSecrets (catastrophic for security)? (High)",
