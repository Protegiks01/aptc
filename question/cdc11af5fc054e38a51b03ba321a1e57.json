  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Database] If databases are empty (no blocks or batches), does the tool handle this gracefully or cause errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Edge Case] [Single Block] When querying a specific block_id that doesn't exist, does the tool return empty results or error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Edge Case] [Orphaned Blocks] Can the tool extract transactions from orphaned blocks that are not part of the committed chain? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Transactions] Can blocks with zero transactions be handled correctly, or does this indicate a consensus bug? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Edge Case] [Duplicate Blocks] If the same block ID exists multiple times in database (database corruption), how is this handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Performance] [Algorithmic Complexity] Is the overall algorithm O(n) where n is number of blocks/transactions, or can nested iterations cause O(n²) or worse complexity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Performance] [Memory Pressure] Loading all_batches into HashMap - can this cause memory pressure affecting other validator processes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Performance] [CPU Exhaustion] Can iterating over millions of blocks and transactions cause CPU exhaustion affecting consensus performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Performance] [I/O Amplification] Does reading all blocks cause excessive disk I/O that could slow down validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Performance] [Clone Cost] Multiple .cloned() calls on transactions - can this cause performance degradation or memory spikes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Operational] [Production Usage] If this tool is accidentally run on production validator with active consensus, can it cause performance degradation or crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Operational] [Debug Tool Access] Are there restrictions on who can run this tool, or can any local process access it? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Operational] [Output Security] Output is printed to stdout - can this be redirected to logs visible to unauthorized parties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Operational] [Error Recovery] If extraction fails midway, is there cleanup of partial results or can partial data remain in memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/db_tool.rs] [Advanced Attack] [Database Injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious database file that, when opened by this tool, executes arbitrary code through deserialization vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
