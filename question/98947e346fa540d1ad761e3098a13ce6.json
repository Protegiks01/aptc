  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: compute_abi()] [Logic Flaw] The filter at lines 132-162 uses complex logic with skip_while and all() - can edge cases with mixed signer/non-signer parameters cause incorrect filtering, including or excluding wrong functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: compute_abi()] [Module Retrieval Error] Line 129 calls get_compiled_module() which can return an error - but this error is propagated up and unwrapped in gen() causing a panic - should this be handled more gracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: compute_abi()] [Empty ABI Generation] If no functions pass the filter, compute_abi() returns Ok(empty vector) - can this cause issues where modules expected to have ABIs have none, leading to missing ABI definitions? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Ability Check Bypass] Lines 197-201 check Copy and Key abilities for struct parameters - can an attacker craft a struct with manipulated ability declarations that pass this check but violate Move's type safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Reference Handling] Lines 194-196 handle immutable references specially - can mutable references bypass this check, or can nested references cause incorrect type extraction?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Code Loading Panic] Line 215 calls load_compiled_bytes() which can fail - if it returns an error, does this propagate correctly or cause a panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Module ID Confusion] Line 224 calls module.self_id() for script functions - can an attacker craft a module with a malicious self_id that differs from the actual module address, causing ABI/module mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Name Case Conversion] Line 186 converts type parameter names to snake_case - can special characters or unicode in type parameter names cause incorrect conversion or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: generate_abi_for_function()] [Documentation Injection] Line 181 includes function documentation in ABIs - can malicious doc comments with special characters or escape sequences cause issues in downstream ABI consumers?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/move-abigen/src/abigen.rs] [Function: load_compiled_bytes()] [Malformed Bytecode] After reading bytes, there's no validation that they represent valid Move bytecode - can malformed bytes be loaded and cause crashes in downstream processing? (High)",
