  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache_non_generic()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly deploy and call unique non-generic functions to fill function_instruction_caches without bound, each creating a new Rc<RefCell<FrameTypeCache>> that persists for the entire transaction block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache_generic()] [Generic explosion] Can an attacker create a generic function with many type parameters and call it with combinatorially many different type instantiations, causing generic_function_instruction_caches to grow exponentially and exhaust memory? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Struct: InterpreterFunctionCaches] [Cache size limits] Is there any maximum size enforcement for function_instruction_caches and generic_function_instruction_caches HashMaps?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache()] [Non-determinism] Since cache hit/miss behavior can vary based on execution order, if transaction ordering differs slightly across validators, can cache state divergence cause different validators to compute different state roots, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Struct: InterpreterFunctionCaches] [HashMap ordering] Rust HashMap iteration order is non-deterministic - if cache iteration is exposed through any code path, can it cause non-deterministic execution results across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache_non_generic()] [Pointer determinism] Since FunctionPtr uses raw pointer values as HashMap keys, and ASLR causes different pointer addresses across processes, can this cause non-deterministic cache behavior where validators disagree on cache state?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Struct: InterpreterFunctionCaches] [Cache timing] Can cache hits vs misses create observable timing differences that affect gas consumption calculations, causing validators to charge different gas amounts for the same transaction and breaking consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache_non_generic()] [Cache size mismatch] If a function's bytecode is modified (e.g., via module upgrade) but the old cache entry persists, can mismatched per_instruction_cache size cause out-of-bounds access or incorrect instruction caching? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/interpreter_caches.rs] [Function: get_or_create_frame_cache_generic()] [Generic cache pollution] Can FrameTypeCache internal state (BTreeMaps for struct/field types) accumulate entries from previous calls with different type parameters, causing cache pollution that affects subsequent calls with the same GenericFunctionPtr?
