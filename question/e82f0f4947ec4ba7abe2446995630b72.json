  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Network Flooding] Can a malicious subscriber cause the publisher to attempt repeated send_serialized_message_to_peer() calls, flooding the network with retransmissions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Byzantine Publishing] Can a compromised validator publish conflicting ConsensusObserverDirectSend messages to different subsets of observers, causing observers to disagree on consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Byzantine Subscription] Can Byzantine validators subscribe and unsubscribe rapidly to cause race conditions in active_subscribers management and disrupt consensus observer operation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Byzantine Network State] Can Byzantine validators manipulate their ConnectionState to avoid garbage collection and maintain subscriptions indefinitely even when disconnected? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Selective Publishing] Can a Byzantine validator selectively call publish_message() for only a subset of consensus updates, causing observers to have incomplete consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Byzantine Serialization] Can a compromised consensus_observer_client provide malicious serialize_message_for_peer() implementation that alters messages for specific peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Loop Termination] Can the else branch in tokio::select! be triggered by legitimate conditions, causing the publisher to exit unexpectedly and halt consensus message distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Ticker Failure] Can the garbage_collection_interval ticker fail or panic, causing the select! to deadlock or exit the loop? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Message Receiver Closure] If publisher_message_receiver closes due to all senders being dropped, does this cause the loop to exit via else branch, permanently stopping consensus publishing? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Graceful Shutdown] Is there any mechanism for graceful shutdown of the publisher, or does exit always result in error logging and potential message loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Task Lifecycle] Does the spawned tokio task run indefinitely until the channel closes, and can this task leak if the publisher is dropped without proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Priority Inversion] Can processing Subscribe/Unsubscribe messages in the select! starve the garbage collection ticker or vice versa, causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: new()] [Config Validation] Is max_network_channel_size validated to be within reasonable bounds, or can it be set to 0 or MAX causing immediate channel failures or memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Config Validation] Is garbage_collection_interval_ms validated to prevent being set to 0 or extremely small values causing excessive CPU usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Config Attack] Can max_parallel_serialization_tasks be set to 0, causing buffered() to never process any messages and blocking all consensus publishing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Struct: ConsensusPublisher] [Config Tampering] Can the ConsensusObserverConfig be modified after publisher creation to change behavior mid-execution, causing inconsistent operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker flood Subscribe requests to artificially inflate PUBLISHER_RECEIVED_REQUESTS metrics, hiding legitimate traffic patterns? (Low)",
