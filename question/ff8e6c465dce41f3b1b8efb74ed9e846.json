  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Trait: WeightedVUF] [Byzantine threshold] Does the overall WeightedVUF design maintain security with up to 1/3 Byzantine validators, or can edge cases in aggregation or verification allow smaller coalitions to break security?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Comment line 30-31] [Stake threshold assumption] The comment states 'more than 33% of the stake must've contributed' for Evaluations - is this enforced cryptographically or just assumed, and can it be violated? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Null parameter handling] Can PublicParameters be constructed as 'empty' or 'null', and would such parameters cause verify_share() to incorrectly accept all proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/traits.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Maximum share limit] Is there a maximum limit on the number of shares in apks_and_proofs, or can unbounded vectors cause memory exhaustion or computational DoS? (Medium)",
