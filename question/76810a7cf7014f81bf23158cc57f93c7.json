  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious root_package_path containing symbolic links or path traversal sequences (../) that bypass directory boundaries and resolve packages from unauthorized filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to resolve() with the same package_lock cause race conditions where multiple threads modify the package_lock simultaneously, leading to corrupted lock state or inconsistent dependency resolution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where the Move.toml file at root_package_path is read twice (line 148-150 and inside resolve_package), allowing an attacker to swap the file between reads and inject malicious dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Manifest Injection] Can an attacker craft a malicious Move.toml that exploits the parse_package_manifest() parser to inject control characters, cause buffer overflows, or trigger unsafe deserialization leading to code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [DoS Attack] Can an attacker provide a Move.toml with extremely large dependency trees (e.g., 10,000+ packages) that exhaust memory or cause stack overflow during recursive resolve_package calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Validation Bypass] Does the function validate that root_package_path actually points to a valid Move package directory before processing, or can an attacker trigger undefined behavior by pointing to arbitrary files/directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Canonical Path Bypass] Can an attacker use case-sensitivity differences in filesystems (e.g., HFS+ vs ext4) to create duplicate package identities with the same canonical path, bypassing the duplicate detection in the resolved BTreeMap? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Dev Mode Confusion] When dev_mode is true, dev dependencies are appended after regular dependencies - can this ordering be exploited to override regular dependencies with malicious dev dependencies through the graph edge ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Graph Pollution] After resolve() completes, are the graph and resolved structures properly isolated, or can an attacker reuse them to pollute subsequent resolution operations with stale or malicious package references? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: resolve()] [Error Information Leakage] Do error messages from failed resolution operations leak sensitive filesystem paths or internal system information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_cyclic_dependencies()] [Algorithm Complexity] Can an attacker craft a dependency graph with specific topology that causes kosaraju_scc algorithm to run in exponential time, causing denial-of-service during package resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_cyclic_dependencies()] [Detection Bypass] Does the function only detect strongly connected components with size > 1, meaning an attacker could create single-node cycles (self-loops) that bypass this check but are caught elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_cyclic_dependencies()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker create a graph with multiple large strongly connected components that exhaust memory during the kosaraju_scc computation or when formatting error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_cyclic_dependencies()] [Unicode Injection] Can an attacker inject Unicode control characters or bidirectional text in package names/locations that corrupt the formatted error output, potentially masking the real cycle or injecting misleading information? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_self_dependencies()] [Logic Error] Could there be an edge case where a package legitimately references itself through a different identity representation (e.g., local path vs git URL) that creates a self-edge but should be allowed? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_self_dependencies()] [Deduplication Bug] After sort_unstable() and dedup() on lines 71-72, is there any scenario where the deduplication could fail due to unstable sort ordering or NodeIndex comparison issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_self_dependencies()] [DoS via Error Message] Can an attacker create thousands of self-dependency packages that cause excessive memory allocation when building the error message string on lines 77-84? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_name_conflicts()] [Dependency Confusion] The comment on line 91-92 states this restriction will be relaxed - when relaxed, could an attacker exploit same-named packages from different sources to cause dependency confusion attacks where a malicious package overrides a legitimate one? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_name_conflicts()] [Case Sensitivity] Does the name conflict check properly handle case-insensitive filesystems (Windows/macOS) vs case-sensitive (Linux), where 'MyPackage' and 'mypackage' might be treated as different packages but collide on certain systems? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_name_conflicts()] [Unicode Normalization] Are package names normalized (NFC/NFD) before comparison, or can an attacker create visually identical package names using different Unicode representations that bypass the conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_name_conflicts()] [Homoglyph Attack] Can an attacker use homoglyphs (visually similar characters like Cyrillic 'а' vs Latin 'a') in package names to create malicious packages that appear legitimate but bypass name conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: check_for_name_conflicts()] [String Comparison] Is identity.name.as_str() comparison vulnerable to NULL byte injection or other string manipulation that could cause two different packages to be considered identical? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Node URL Trust] For SourceLocation::OnChain, the function expects user_provided_url must be specified (line 191) - can an attacker provide a malicious fullnode URL pointing to a compromised node that serves backdoored package code? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Network Version Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the network_version resolution on line 193 to fetch packages from the wrong network (e.g., testnet packages on mainnet), potentially introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_package_local_path()] [Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker poison the package_cache by providing malicious packages for specific package_addr that get cached and served to subsequent legitimate resolution requests?
