  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: supply_aggregator_state_key()] [State key collision] Can supply_aggregator_state_key() return StateKeys that collide with other resources if handle/key values are not properly validated, allowing supply modifications to corrupt unrelated state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: supply_aggregator_state_key()] [Missing validation] Is there validation ensuring the StateKey returned by supply_aggregator_state_key() actually points to an aggregator value resource, or can it point to arbitrary state causing type confusion during reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: supply_aggregator_state_key()] [Double unwrap] Does the double unwrap pattern (supply unwrap, then aggregator unwrap) create a code path where supply=Some(OptionalAggregatorV1Resource{aggregator: None}) causes a panic despite supply being Some? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [State corruption] Can to_writeset() create inconsistent state if supply parameter doesn't match the limit in the aggregator, causing the stored supply value to violate aggregator invariants immediately after initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [BCS encoding] Does to_writeset() handle BCS serialization failures gracefully, or can malformed CoinInfo data cause bcs::to_bytes(&self).unwrap() to panic during writeset generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Supply validation] Is the supply parameter validated against aggregator limit and u128 bounds in to_writeset(), or can extremely large values cause overflow when the aggregator processes supply modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [StateKey derivation] Does to_writeset() properly derive StateKey::resource_typed::<Self>(&C::coin_info_address())? to ensure it matches the canonical CoinInfo address, or can incorrect address derivation cause the CoinInfo to be stored at the wrong location? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Write operation type] Why does to_writeset() use WriteOp::legacy_modification instead of WriteOp::creation for potentially new resources, and can this cause issues if the CoinInfo already exists at the target address? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Atomic consistency] Does to_writeset() ensure both CoinInfo and aggregator value are written atomically, or can partial writes occur if WriteSetMut::freeze() fails, leaving inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Unwrap on freeze] Can WriteSetMut::freeze().unwrap() panic if the writeset contains invalid operations, causing validator crashes during CoinInfo initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Function: to_writeset()] [Duplicate keys] Does to_writeset() check for duplicate StateKeys in the write_set vec before freezing, or can duplicate entries cause non-deterministic write ordering and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type tag validation] Can type_args() return invalid or malicious TypeTags from C::type_tag() that break Move type safety or cause VM crashes during resource access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module name collision] Are MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME constants validated to match the actual Move module deployment, or can mismatches cause resource access to wrong addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Type parameter confusion] Can different CoinType implementations provide the same type_tag(), causing multiple Rust types to map to the same Move resource type and breaking type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Serialize] [BCS compatibility] Does the Serde serialization match BCS encoding requirements exactly, or can discrepancies cause validators to compute different state roots for identical CoinInfo resources? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Malicious input] Can an attacker craft BCS-encoded data that deserializes into a CoinInfoResource with invalid invariants (e.g., supply aggregator with limit < current value), bypassing Move-side validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Deserialize] [Version compatibility] If the CoinInfoResource struct schema changes in future versions, will old serialized data deserialize correctly or cause panics/corruption when nodes with different versions process the same state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Serde: Serialize] [Non-determinism] Does serialization order of fields match BCS canonical ordering, or can different Rust compiler versions produce different byte sequences for the same CoinInfo, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: supply] [Optional semantics] Can supply field be Some(OptionalAggregatorV1Resource{aggregator: None, integer: Some(x)}) creating ambiguous supply tracking where neither aggregator nor simple integer is the source of truth? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: supply] [Race conditions] If supply field references an aggregator that can be modified concurrently by parallel transactions, can race conditions cause CoinInfo to report stale supply values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: supply] [State synchronization] Does supply field maintain consistency with the actual aggregator value stored in state, or can they diverge if aggregator is modified directly without updating CoinInfo? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_info.rs] [Field: supply] [Type confusion] Can the OptionalAggregatorV1Resource contain both aggregator=Some and integer=Some simultaneously, creating ambiguous supply tracking that breaks Move coin module invariants? (High)",
