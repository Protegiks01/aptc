  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError] [Error exhaustiveness] Do all error handling paths in the peer manager properly handle every PeerManagerError variant, or can unexpected variants reach code that doesn't handle them, causing crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError] [Transaction propagation] Can errors in PeerManagerError cause legitimate transactions to fail propagation to mempool, enabling censorship attacks or selective transaction suppression? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/error.rs] [Enum: PeerManagerError::NotConnected] [Transaction routing] Does NotConnected error handling have fallback mechanisms for transaction propagation, or can targeted disconnection of specific peers enable transaction censorship attacks?
