  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Serialization format] FUNCTION_DATA_SERIALIZATION_FORMAT_V1 is constant - if this is ever incremented, are there migration paths that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Serialization compatibility] Can an attacker craft serialized closures from V1 that become invalid in V2 but are still accepted due to version check bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Serialization size] Is there any maximum size limit for serialized MoveClosure objects? Can attackers create unbounded serialized data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Cross-module call] Can an attacker create a closure referencing a function in module A but provide captured values meant for module B, causing type confusion across modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Module upgrade] If a module is upgraded after a closure is created, can the closure invoke the old version's function or cause version mismatch errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Cross-account attack] Can an attacker create a closure referencing a function in another account's module to bypass access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Empty closure] Can an attacker create a MoveClosure with empty captured vector and mask=0? Does this edge case cause issues during invocation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Maximum captured args] Can an attacker create a closure with exactly 64 captured arguments (MAX_ARGS limit) and does this boundary case work correctly in all operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [All args captured] If mask has all 64 bits set, does this cause any integer overflow or logic errors in extract(), compose(), or other operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/function.rs] [Zero-sized types] Can captured contain zero-sized MoveValues like empty structs? Does serialization/deserialization handle these correctly? (Low)"
