  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious file_path parameter containing path traversal sequences (../, symlinks) to read arbitrary files on the validator's filesystem, potentially exposing private keys or configuration secrets? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Symlink Attack] Does the FileStream constructor validate that file_path is not a symbolic link pointing to sensitive system files (/etc/shadow, validator keys), allowing unauthorized file access during periodic reads? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit a time-of-check-time-of-use race condition by replacing the peer configuration file between poll intervals, injecting malicious peer addresses after validation but before processing? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [File Replacement Attack] If an attacker gains write access to the file_path location, can they atomically replace the peer configuration file with malicious content during the std::fs::read_to_string() call, bypassing any file integrity checks? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [Path Canonicalization] Does the code canonicalize the file_path to prevent attacks using equivalent paths (./config.yaml vs config.yaml vs /full/path/config.yaml) that might bypass access control or monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [YAML Bomb] Can an attacker craft a malicious YAML file with deeply nested structures, aliases, or anchors that cause exponential memory consumption during serde_yaml::from_str() parsing, leading to validator node crashes or resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Deserialization Attack] Does the serde_yaml::from_str() call properly validate PeerSet deserialization bounds, or can an attacker inject arbitrary Rust types/structures through YAML type confusion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Billion Laughs Attack] Can an attacker use YAML entity expansion (e.g., repeated aliases) to cause quadratic or exponential parsing time, effectively DoS'ing the validator node during periodic file reads? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Unicode Exploitation] Can malformed UTF-8 or special Unicode characters in the YAML file cause parsing errors that crash the discovery process or bypass validation logic in PeerSet deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Integer Overflow in YAML] If the YAML contains extremely large integer values for peer counts or network addresses, can this cause integer overflow during PeerSet deserialization leading to memory corruption or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Async Race Condition] Since poll_next() is called concurrently by the async runtime, can multiple concurrent polls create race conditions when accessing self.file_path or self.interval, potentially causing file reads to overlap or skip updates? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Panic in Poll] If load_file() panics due to malformed YAML, does this panic propagate through the Stream implementation and crash the entire discovery subsystem, causing loss of network connectivity? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Unbounded Error Propagation] When load_file() returns DiscoveryError, does the Stream continue polling indefinitely without backoff or circuit breaking, potentially causing repeated I/O storms if the file is persistently corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Interval Drift] Can manipulation of the system clock or TimeService cause the interval to drift significantly, either missing critical peer updates (clock advance) or flooding the system with redundant reads (clock regression)? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Memory Leak on Error] Does the Poll::Ready(Some(Err(error))) path properly clean up resources, or can repeated errors cause memory leaks in the error handling chain accumulating over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can an attacker create an extremely large YAML file (gigabytes) that gets read entirely into memory via std::fs::read_to_string(), causing out-of-memory crashes on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [File Permission Race] If file permissions are changed between interval polls (e.g., chmod 000), does the I/O error handling prevent the discovery system from recovering when permissions are restored, causing permanent loss of peer updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [File Deletion Attack] If an attacker deletes the file_path file between polls, does the DiscoveryError::IO error cause the discovery system to stop functioning, or does it continue with stale peer data potentially isolating the validator? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Hard Link Manipulation] Can an attacker create hard links to the configuration file and modify the original, bypassing file monitoring systems that only watch the original inode? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: new()] [File Descriptor Leak] If the file is opened but never properly closed due to Stream being dropped unexpectedly, can this cause file descriptor leaks over extended validator operation? (Low)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Malicious Peer Injection] After successful YAML parsing, does the code validate that the PeerSet contains only legitimate peer addresses, or can an attacker inject malicious IP addresses/ports that connect to attacker-controlled nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Peer Identity Spoofing] Does the PeerSet deserialization verify cryptographic identity proofs for each peer, or can an attacker register fake peer identities (PeerId) that impersonate legitimate validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Peer Count Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a YAML file with an excessive number of peers (thousands/millions) that overwhelms the connectivity manager when UpdateDiscoveredPeers is sent, causing validator connectivity failures? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Network Address Validation] Does PeerSet deserialization validate NetworkAddress formats (IP ranges, port numbers, protocol types), or can invalid addresses cause crashes or undefined behavior in downstream network components? (High)",
  "[File: network/discovery/src/file.rs] [Function: load_file()] [Private IP Injection] Can an attacker inject private IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) into the peer list that redirect network connections to localhost or internal network services, enabling SSRF attacks? (High)"
