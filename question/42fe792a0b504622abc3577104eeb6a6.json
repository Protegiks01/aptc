  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Gas Front-Running] Can an attacker craft a transaction that charges minimal gas in `native_dispatch()` but dispatches to an expensive function, causing validators to waste resources and potentially halting the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/dispatchable_fungible_asset.rs] [Function: native_dispatch()] [Gas Undercharge] Does the flat `DISPATCHABLE_FUNGIBLE_ASSET_DISPATCH_BASE` fee properly account for the cost of complex dispatched functions, or can attackers exploit underpriced operations to drain validator resources?
