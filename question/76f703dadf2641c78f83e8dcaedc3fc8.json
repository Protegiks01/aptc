  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Trailing bytes attack] Does BCS deserialization enforce that all input bytes are consumed, or can an attacker append malicious data after the epoch field that gets silently ignored, hiding attack payloads in events? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: dummy()] [Test data leak] Is the dummy() function with epoch = 0 strictly gated behind test/fuzzing features, or can it be accidentally called in production, allowing creation of invalid genesis-like epoch events? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: dummy()] [Feature flag bypass] Can an attacker compile the validator with --features fuzzing enabled in production, exposing dummy() and allowing creation of arbitrary test epoch events that bypass normal validation? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Data exposure] Does the epoch() getter expose internal epoch state that should be kept private, allowing attackers to query and predict future epoch values for timing attacks on consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Return value validation] Should epoch() perform bounds checking or validation before returning the value, or can it return corrupted/invalid epoch numbers that callers assume are valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event emission control] Who can emit NewEpochEvent on-chain, and is there proper access control preventing arbitrary accounts from triggering fake epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event ordering] Can NewEpochEvent events be emitted out-of-order or in parallel, causing validators to process epoch transitions in different sequences and fork the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event replay] Is there protection against replaying old NewEpochEvent events, or can an attacker re-emit historical epoch events to confuse validators about the current epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: event_key()] [Event subscription hijacking] Can an attacker subscribe to the NewEpochEvent key and filter/block events from reaching validators, preventing epoch transitions and halting consensus? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Missing validator set] Does NewEpochEvent contain sufficient information for epoch transitions (only epoch number), or should it include validator set changes, making the current design vulnerable to state desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module upgrade attack] If the on-chain 'reconfiguration' module is upgraded with a different NewEpochEvent struct layout, can this Rust type definition become out-of-sync, causing deserialization failures during epoch transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: event_key()] [Module key dependency] Does event_key() retrieve a hardcoded constant, or does it query the on-chain reconfiguration module, creating a dependency that could be exploited if the module is maliciously modified? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Schema evolution] If NewEpochEvent needs new fields in the future (e.g., validator set hash), is there a versioning mechanism, or will adding fields break backward compatibility and cause network splits? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Static: NEW_EPOCH_EVENT_MOVE_TYPE_TAG] [Lazy static race] Can multiple threads simultaneously trigger Lazy initialization of type tags during node startup, causing race conditions that result in inconsistent type tag values across threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Concurrent deserialization] If multiple threads deserialize NewEpochEvent events concurrently, can race conditions in BCS decoding or shared state cause data corruption or inconsistent epoch values? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: event_key()] [Key caching issues] If event_key() is called from multiple threads, is the underlying new_epoch_event_key() implementation thread-safe, or can concurrent calls return different keys causing event delivery failures? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error information leak] Does map_err(Into::into) properly sanitize error messages, or can BCS deserialization errors leak internal state information that helps attackers craft targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic vs error] Are all failure modes properly converted to Result errors, or can certain invalid inputs cause panics instead, potentially crashing validators during epoch event processing? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Epoch boundary enforcement] Does the consensus state machine properly validate that NewEpochEvent only appears at epoch boundaries, or can attackers emit events mid-epoch to trigger premature validator set changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Transaction ordering] Can NewEpochEvent be emitted from user transactions, or is it restricted to system transactions, preventing attackers from injecting epoch events at arbitrary transaction positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Event handling atomicity] If processing NewEpochEvent fails partway through (e.g., during validator set update), can the system be left in an inconsistent state with partially applied epoch changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/account_config/events/new_epoch.rs] [Struct: NewEpochEvent] [Epoch addition overflow] When incrementing epoch values in consensus logic, can u64::MAX be reached, causing overflow and wrapping epoch numbers back to 0, potentially resetting the chain state? (High)",
