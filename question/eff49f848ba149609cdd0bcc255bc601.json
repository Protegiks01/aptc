  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: setup_for_testing Usage] Every benchmark uses setup_for_testing() (lines 17, 42, 67, 87, 115, 144, 174, 207, 241) - is this testing setup cryptographically equivalent to production setup(), or could differences hide vulnerabilities that only manifest with real PVSS-based key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: Batch Size Testing] Batch sizes are limited to powers-of-2 and max 2048 - does this fail to test extremely large batches (10K+) that could expose memory exhaustion, integer overflow, or performance degradation vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: No Byzantine Behavior] None of the benchmarks test malicious inputs - does this mean adversarial performance characteristics (e.g., worst-case ciphertext verification time, proof computation under attack) are completely unknown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: Threshold Configuration Variety] Only two threshold patterns are tested: (1,1) and (n*2/3+1, n) - does this limited testing miss vulnerabilities at other threshold ratios like (t=1, n=100) or (t=99, n=100)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: No Timing Attack Testing] Criterion measures wall-clock time - does this fail to detect variable-time cryptographic operations that leak secret information through timing side channels, particularly in derive_decryption_key_share() and decrypt()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: Associated Data Empty] Most benchmarks use empty associated_data - does this fail to test the performance impact of realistic metadata sizes (transaction hashes, timestamps, validator IDs) that could affect authentication tag computation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: No Cross-Round Testing] All operations use round=0 - does this miss vulnerabilities in round number wrapping, overflow, or replay protection across epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Global: Single Message Type] Only String plaintexts are tested - does this fail to benchmark performance with complex types (nested structs, large vectors, transaction payloads) that might have different serialization costs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/benches/fptx.rs] [Lines 273-285: Criterion Setup] The criterion_main! macro invokes all benchmarks - is there any validation that benchmark results are stable across runs, or could non-determinism in cryptographic operations cause spurious performance regressions? (Low)"
