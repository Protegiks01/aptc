  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: check_diag()] [Severity Confusion] If report_severity is set to Severity::Warning but GlobalEnv contains Severity::Error diagnostics, does check_diag() correctly detect errors via has_errors(), or can severity mismatch cause unsafe code to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: check_diag()] [Idempotency Side Effect] The comment claims check_diag() is idempotent, but can calling it multiple times with different report_severity values cause diagnostics to be reported in inconsistent orders, breaking deterministic compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: check_diag()] [Error Accumulation] Can repeated calls to check_diag() without clearing GlobalEnv diagnostics cause error accumulation that eventually exceeds memory limits and crashes validator nodes during continuous compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Function: check_diag()] [Return Value Confusion] Does check_diag() returning Ok(()) definitively guarantee no errors exist, or can edge cases in has_errors() cause false negatives where errors are present but unreported? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Concurrent Compilation] When multiple Move contracts are compiled in parallel, can race conditions in shared error_writer() or error_emitter() instances cause diagnostic interleaving or lost error messages? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [GlobalEnv State Corruption] Can malicious Move code trigger compiler bugs that corrupt GlobalEnv diagnostic state, causing subsequent compilations to report stale or incorrect errors affecting unrelated contracts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Emitter Trait Object Safety] Is the Emitter trait properly object-safe for dynamic dispatch, or can adding future methods cause vtable corruption when mixing different emitter implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Error Context Loss] Can diagnostic emission through the Emitter trait lose critical error context (stack traces, causality chains) that would be necessary for validators to identify malicious contract patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Module: diagnostics] [Options Mutability] Are the Options used by error_writer() and error_emitter() properly synchronized, or can mutable access to Options during diagnostic emission cause data races and inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: JsonEmitter] [JSON Injection] When MESSAGE_FORMAT_JSON is enabled, can an attacker inject malicious JSON through diagnostic messages (e.g., unescaped quotes, control characters) that break JSON structure and exploit parsing vulnerabilities in downstream tools? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: JsonEmitter] [Serialization Denial of Service] Can malicious Move code trigger deeply nested diagnostic structures that cause serde_json::to_writer() to exhaust stack space or CPU during JSON serialization, halting validator compilation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: JsonEmitter] [File Path Disclosure] Does JsonEmitter sanitize file paths before including them in JSON output, or can absolute paths expose validator filesystem structure and deployment paths to attackers monitoring error outputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: JsonEmitter] [Expect Panic] JsonEmitter uses expect() for serialization errors - can crafted diagnostics trigger these expects to panic, causing unclean shutdown and potential state corruption in the compiler? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: HumanEmitter] [ANSI Injection] Can malicious Move code inject ANSI escape sequences through diagnostic messages that exploit terminal emulators when HumanEmitter outputs colored text to stderr, potentially achieving command execution on validator terminals? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: HumanEmitter] [Buffer Overflow] Does codespan_reporting::term::emit() properly bound output buffer sizes, or can extremely long diagnostic messages cause buffer overflows in the WriteColor implementation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: HumanEmitter] [Expect Panic] HumanEmitter uses expect('emit must not fail') - can I/O errors or malformed diagnostics trigger this expect to panic, leaving the compiler in an undefined state and breaking subsequent compilations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: Experiment] [Flag Injection] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables (MVC_EXP, MOVE_COMPILER_EXP) or command-line arguments to inject malicious experiment flags that alter diagnostic behavior and suppress security-critical compiler errors? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: Experiment] [Default Value Attack] If MESSAGE_FORMAT_JSON defaults to false, can attackers exploit deployment scripts that don't explicitly set this flag to force human-readable output where JSON was expected, breaking automated security scanning? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: Experiment] [Experiment Toggle Race] Can experiment flags be toggled during compilation, causing error_emitter() to return different emitter types for the same compilation session and breaking diagnostic consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [Diagnostic Deduplication Bypass] Can an attacker craft diagnostics with identical content but different metadata (timestamps, thread IDs) that bypass GlobalEnv's deduplication logic, causing error floods? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [Primary Target Filter Manipulation] Can malicious code manipulate which files are considered 'primary targets' to suppress errors from malicious imports while only showing benign diagnostic output? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [RefCell Panic] GlobalEnv stores diagnostics in RefCell<Vec<...>> - can concurrent access trigger RefCell borrow panics during report_diag(), causing validator nodes to crash during parallel compilation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: GlobalEnv] [Sorting Side Effects] GlobalEnv sorts diagnostics by location and severity - can this sorting be exploited to reorder error messages in ways that hide critical security errors behind less severe warnings? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/diagnostics/mod.rs] [Integration: Files] [FileId Integer Overflow] Can malicious FileId values cause integer overflow when used as indices into Files<String>, leading to memory corruption or arbitrary file access during diagnostic emission? (High)",
