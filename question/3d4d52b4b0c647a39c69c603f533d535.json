  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Body Construction] Does Body::from() perform copying of the identity_information string, and could large responses cause memory duplication issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Default Insecurity] Since the default value of expose_identity_information is true, are production mainnet validators at risk of running with identity exposure enabled unless they explicitly configure it to false? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Configuration Injection] Can attackers who compromise the config loading process inject a malicious NodeConfig with expose_identity_information=true to force identity disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Config Optimization Bypass] Does the ConfigOptimizer automatically enable expose_identity_information for non-mainnet chains, and could chain_id spoofing cause mainnet validators to leak identity information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Sanitizer Bypass] Does the ConfigSanitizer only check expose_configuration for mainnet validators but not expose_identity_information, allowing identity leaks even when configuration exposure is blocked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Network Topology Disclosure] Does exposing all fullnode network IDs and peer IDs reveal the complete network topology of a validator, enabling attackers to identify connection patterns and plan eclipse attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [VFN Identification] Can attackers use this endpoint to identify which fullnode networks are Validator Full Nodes (VFN) vs Public Full Nodes, enabling targeted attacks on the validator's trusted fullnodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Network ID Leakage] Does exposing network_id values (NetworkId::Validator, NetworkId::Vfn, NetworkId::Public) help attackers understand the network architecture and identify attack surfaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Peer Discovery] Can the exposed peer IDs be used to impersonate or spoof connections to the validator, bypassing network authentication mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [HTTP Response Manipulation] Can attackers exploit the returned Body and StatusCode to inject malicious content or manipulate the HTTP response before it reaches the client? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Content Type Confusion] Does returning CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT without proper validation allow attackers to exploit downstream consumers that expect JSON or other formats? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Newline Injection] Can malicious newline characters in peer_id or network_id display strings break the line-based output format, causing parsing errors in monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Join Separator Attack] Does using join(",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Peer ID Collision] If two networks have colliding peer IDs due to implementation bugs, does the endpoint expose this inconsistency, or does it mask the security issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Identity Derivation] Since peer_id is derived from x25519 public keys using from_identity_public_key, does exposing peer IDs leak information about the underlying cryptographic keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Key Rotation] When validator keys are rotated, does this endpoint expose both old and new peer IDs during transition, potentially enabling correlation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [AccountAddress Exposure] Since PeerId is an alias for AccountAddress, does exposing peer IDs reveal validator account addresses that could be targeted in on-chain attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the IDENTITY_INFO_DISABLED_MESSAGE constant reveal information about the node configuration structure or enable attackers to fingerprint Aptos node versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Status Code Information] Does returning StatusCode::FORBIDDEN vs StatusCode::NOT_FOUND leak information about whether the endpoint exists but is disabled vs doesn't exist at all? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [Timing Side-Channel] Can attackers use timing differences between the disabled path (immediate 403) and enabled path (config traversal) to infer whether expose_identity_information is enabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Null Configuration] Does the function handle the case where validator_network is Some(config) but the config has invalid or default values, potentially exposing incorrect identity information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Empty Networks] If full_node_networks is empty, does the function return meaningful information or could it mislead operators into thinking the node has no fullnode connectivity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Duplicate Networks] Can multiple fullnode networks with identical network_ids cause confusion in the output, potentially masking configuration errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: get_identity_information()] [Network Type Validation] Does the function validate that validator_network actually has NetworkId::Validator, or could misconfiguration expose wrong network types? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/identity_information.rs] [Function: handle_identity_information_request()] [No Authentication] Since the inspection service has no built-in authentication, can any network attacker access this endpoint if it's exposed on a public interface?
