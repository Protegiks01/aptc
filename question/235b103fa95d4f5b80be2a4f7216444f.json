  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Panic in health check] If health_checker.check() panics instead of returning error, does this crash the entire handler task or is it caught? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Observability blind spots] Are health check failures logged or monitored? Can silent failures accumulate without operators knowing the ready server is degraded? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Metrics collection] Is there any metrics collection on request rate, latency, or health check failures? Without this, can performance issues go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Debugging information] In production, does ReadyData leak debugging information that should be redacted for security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Overall architecture] [Single point of failure] The ready server is a single endpoint for all health checks - can its failure cascade to prevent service discovery causing total localnet unavailability? (High)"
