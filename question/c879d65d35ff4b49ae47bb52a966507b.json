  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/uninitialized_use_checker.rs] [Pipeline: Annotation persistence] When keep_annotations is false, does this prevent debugging of checker bugs in production, hiding potential security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/uninitialized_use_checker.rs] [Attack: Bytecode fuzzing] Can automated fuzzing of Move bytecode find edge cases where the checker's CFG construction or transfer functions produce incorrect results allowing uninitialized use through? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/uninitialized_use_checker.rs] [Attack: Compiler version mismatch] If Move bytecode compiled with an older compiler version is checked by a newer version of this checker, can schema mismatches cause false negatives? (High)",
