  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: StorageErrorEncountered] [Error Confusion] Are there scenarios where actual peer misbehavior causes storage errors that get classified as StorageErrorEncountered instead of InvalidRequest, allowing continued attacks? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [Ignore Evasion] Can a malicious peer, after being marked with TooManyInvalidRequests, quickly reconnect with a new PeerId to reset the invalid request counter and continue attacks? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [VFN Exploitation] Since VFN peers are never ignored despite tracking invalid request counts, can a malicious VFN exploit this to send unlimited invalid requests without facing the TooManyInvalidRequests error? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [Validator Network] Does the TooManyInvalidRequests mechanism fail to apply to validator network peers, allowing malicious validators to probe the storage service without rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [Exponential Backoff Overflow] Can the exponential backoff in min_time_to_ignore_secs eventually overflow when doubled repeatedly (line 90 in moderator.rs), causing integer overflow and either wrapping to zero or panicking? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [Time Manipulation] If a malicious peer can somehow affect the TimeService, could they manipulate ignored_duration calculations to unblock themselves early from TooManyInvalidRequests state? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: TooManyInvalidRequests] [Concurrent Resets] Can race conditions between validate_request and refresh_unhealthy_peer_states allow a peer to send invalid requests in a window after being unblocked but before the counter truly resets? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: UnexpectedErrorEncountered] [Catch-all Abuse] Does using UnexpectedErrorEncountered as a catch-all for anyhow and response errors create a blind spot where actual security-relevant errors go undetected and unmetered? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: UnexpectedErrorEncountered] [Error Masking] Can critical security errors (panics, assertion failures, memory corruption) be masked as UnexpectedErrorEncountered, preventing proper incident response? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: UnexpectedErrorEncountered] [Debug Information] Does UnexpectedErrorEncountered preserve enough context to debug actual attacks versus bugs, or does the to_string() conversion lose stack traces and error chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Variant: UnexpectedErrorEncountered] [Amplification] Can specific unexpected errors trigger repeated retries or cascading failures across multiple nodes, creating an amplification effect from a single malicious request? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Conversions: All From impls] [Type Confusion] Can the implicit From trait conversions lead to incorrect error handling where security-critical errors silently convert to benign-looking error types? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Conversions: All From impls] [Performance] Do the to_string() calls in all From implementations create performance bottlenecks during high error rates, enabling amplification DoS where triggering errors is expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Conversions: All From impls] [Audit Trail] Does the conversion-based error handling lose the ability to properly audit and trace attack patterns through error logs due to type information loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Moderator] [Validation Bypass] Can requests that fail storage_server_summary.can_service() checks be classified as errors other than InvalidRequest, bypassing the moderator's invalid request tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Moderator] [Count Accuracy] Does the error type returned by validate_request accurately reflect whether invalid_request_count should be incremented, or can misclassification cause incorrect peer health tracking? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Moderator] [Race Conditions] Can concurrent error handling across multiple threads lead to race conditions in error classification that affect the accuracy of the moderator's peer health state? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Moderator] [State Inconsistency] If errors are converted through multiple From implementations before reaching the moderator, can this create inconsistencies in how peer behavior is tracked? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Handler] [Error Mapping] In handler.rs process_request (line 196-202), does the mapping of internal Error types to StorageServiceError types preserve security boundaries, or can internal errors leak to clients? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Handler] [Error Response] Can the error-to-StorageServiceError conversion be exploited to send misleading error responses to peers, causing them to incorrectly sync state or halt? (High)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Handler] [Metric Pollution] Does the error handling in process_request correctly categorize errors for metrics, or can attackers pollute metrics by triggering specific error paths? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Handler] [Cache Poisoning] Can errors during LRU cache operations be exploited to either poison the cache with invalid data or bypass cache validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Subscription] [Metadata Validation] In subscription.rs (line 348-356), can InvalidRequest errors from metadata mismatches be exploited to map valid subscription metadata by brute force without rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Subscription] [Index Attacks] Can InvalidRequest errors from invalid subscription indices (line 360-368) be triggered repeatedly to map the subscription state without triggering TooManyInvalidRequests? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Subscription] [Max Subscriptions] When max_num_active_subscriptions is exceeded (line 370-381), does the InvalidRequest error prevent the client from monopolizing subscription slots across multiple connection attempts? (High)"
