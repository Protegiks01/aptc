  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::get_all_shares_authors()] [State query timing] Can an attacker query shares between state transitions to learn information about which validators have submitted shares, enabling targeted network attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::get_self_share()] [Share availability] Does get_self_share() properly handle the case where self share was removed during retain(), or can this cause None to be returned when a share is expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::has_decision()] [State observation race] Can has_decision() return true while try_aggregate() is still running in the background, causing validators to believe randomness is ready before it's actually computed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::total_weights()] [None for Decided] Does returning None for Decided state create logic errors in callers that assume total_weights is always available, potentially causing panic or incorrect behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::new()] [Fast path initialization] If fast_rand_config is Some but fast_rand_map initialization fails, can this create inconsistent state where fast path is partially enabled, causing validators to diverge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::new()] [Epoch validation] Does the constructor validate that epoch is monotonically increasing, or can an attacker create RandStore instances for past epochs and replay old randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::update_highest_known_round()] [Round manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator send shares for extremely high future rounds to artificially inflate highest_known_round, causing legitimate shares to be rejected as 'past rounds'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::update_highest_known_round()] [Integer overflow] Can setting highest_known_round to u64::MAX cause arithmetic overflow in FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT calculations, allowing shares from any round to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::reset()] [State deletion vulnerability] Does reset() properly clean up both rand_map and fast_rand_map, or can stale entries remain in one map causing validators to use outdated randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::reset()] [Round boundary bug] When reset() uses split_off(&round), does this include or exclude the target round, and can off-by-one errors cause the current round's data to be deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::reset()] [Concurrent reset race] If multiple threads call reset() with different round values concurrently, can this cause data corruption or inconsistent highest_known_round state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_rand_metadata()] [Duplicate metadata] Can add_rand_metadata() be called multiple times for the same round with different metadata, and does this properly update or corrupt the RandItem state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_rand_metadata()] [Fast path divergence] If metadata is added to slow path but fast path aggregation fails, can this cause validators to have different randomness on fast vs slow paths, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_rand_metadata()] [Entry creation race] Does or_insert_with() create a new RandItem atomically, or can concurrent calls create multiple items for the same round causing duplicate randomness generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_rand_metadata()] [Aggregation ordering] Can try_aggregate() be called before all necessary shares are added, causing premature aggregation with insufficient validator participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Epoch mismatch] Does the epoch validation properly compare share.metadata().epoch with self.epoch using constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks revealing epoch information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Future round attack] Can a Byzantine validator send shares with round values just within FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT limit but far ahead of consensus, filling memory with future round data and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT overflow] Can the addition 'highest_known_round + FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT' overflow u64, causing all future shares to be accepted and bypassing round validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Path confusion] Can an attacker send a share marked as Fast path when fast_rand_config is None, causing the bail to expose whether fast path is enabled for fingerprinting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Config mismatch] When PathType::Fast is specified but fast path is unavailable, does the error handling prevent the share from being added to slow path as a fallback, or can this cause path confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Boolean return manipulation] Does returning Ok(rand_item.has_decision()) leak timing information about when threshold is reached, allowing network observers to infer validator participation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::add_share()] [Entry insertion timing] Can the or_insert_with() lazy evaluation be exploited where multiple threads create different RandItem instances before insertion, causing inconsistent PathType values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::get_all_shares_authors()] [Privacy leak] Does exposing all share authors allow Byzantine validators to identify which honest validators have not yet submitted shares, enabling targeted network isolation attacks?
