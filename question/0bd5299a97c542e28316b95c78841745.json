  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Production Misuse] Could this mock context creation function accidentally be imported and used in production API endpoints instead of the real context, bypassing all authentication, validation, and state consistency checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Chain ID Confusion] Does using ChainId::test() in the fake context risk generating OpenAPI specs that differ from production behavior, potentially causing client applications to make incorrect assumptions about chain ID validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Mock Data Leakage] Could the MockDbReaderWriter implementation return dummy/incorrect state data that gets embedded in OpenAPI examples, misleading developers about actual API behavior and state structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Configuration Weakness] Does NodeConfig::default() contain insecure default settings (e.g., disabled authentication, permissive CORS, high rate limits) that might be documented in the generated OpenAPI spec as acceptable production values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Missing Validation] Does the fake context lack critical security validators that would normally verify transaction signatures, gas limits, and account permissions, potentially causing the OpenAPI spec to omit required security parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Mempool Bypass] Does MockSharedMempool::new_with_runtime() create a mempool without proper transaction validation, admission control, or DoS protection, which could mislead developers about required mempool security checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Table Info Reader Absence] Does passing None for the table info reader parameter disable state sharding and indexer integration checks, potentially generating an incomplete OpenAPI spec that omits required indexer endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [State Inconsistency] Could the Arc::new(MockDbReaderWriter) wrapper create shared state references that don't match production concurrency patterns, causing race condition vulnerabilities to be hidden in the OpenAPI spec generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Build-Time Security] Is this utility function protected against supply chain attacks where malicious build scripts could modify the fake context to inject backdoors into the generated OpenAPI specification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Runtime Isolation] Does MockSharedMempool::new_with_runtime() create an isolated tokio runtime that could leak resources or create deadlocks if improperly cleaned up during spec generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Import Confusion] Could naming this function get_fake_context() (vs get_test_context() or get_openapi_context()) lead to accidental usage in test suites that should use realistic contexts, hiding integration bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/openapi-spec-generator/src/fake_context.rs] [Function: get_fake_context()] [Version Mismatch] Does the mock context use the latest API version and feature flags, or could it generate OpenAPI specs for deprecated/removed endpoints that no longer exist in production? (Low)"
