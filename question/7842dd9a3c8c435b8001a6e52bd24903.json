  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Integration] [Block Size Limits] If shuffle() is called with more transactions than can fit in a block, does it properly handle truncation without corrupting state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Integration] [Iterator Exhaustion] If the returned iterator from signed_transaction_iterator() is not fully consumed, can it leak resources or leave DelayedQueue in inconsistent state? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/mod.rs] [Struct: Config] [Governance Attack] Can a malicious governance proposal set spread factors to values that create extreme delays (e.g., 2^64-1), effectively censoring all transactions? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/delayed_queue.rs] [Invariant] [Placeholder Consistency] Can an account or use case exist in both the main queue and placeholder queue simultaneously, causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/transaction_shuffler/use_case_aware/delayed_queue.rs] [Invariant] [Delay Key Uniqueness] Can two different transactions have the same DelayKey (same try_delay_till and input_idx), causing BTreeMap corruption? (High)",
