  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Command Injection] Can an attacker manipulate command-line arguments to bypass intended command routing and execute unauthorized backup operations, potentially exposing sensitive blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the run() method verify operator permissions before executing backup commands, or can any user with CLI access trigger critical backup/restore operations affecting node state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Race Condition] When multiple Command::run() invocations execute concurrently with different backup types (EpochEnding, StateSnapshot, Transaction), can race conditions in storage initialization cause data corruption or inconsistent backup state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly invoke Command::run() to spawn unlimited BackupServiceClient instances wrapped in Arc, causing memory exhaustion and node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Error Information Leakage] Do error messages propagated from Result<()> returns expose sensitive information about node state, storage paths, or internal architecture that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 176-185] [State Corruption] In the BackupType::EpochEnding handler, if storage.init_storage().await? fails after client Arc is created, does incomplete cleanup leave orphaned connections that could interfere with subsequent backup attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 176-185] [Epoch Manipulation] Can an attacker craft malicious EpochEndingBackupOpt parameters that cause EpochEndingBackupController to backup incorrect epoch boundaries, enabling later restoration to inconsistent validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 177-184] [Backup Integrity] Does EpochEndingBackupController.run() validate that backed-up epoch endings match blockchain consensus state, or can a compromised backup service inject fraudulent epoch data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 186-195] [State Snapshot Poisoning] In BackupType::StateSnapshot handling, can an attacker manipulate StateSnapshotBackupOpt to trigger backups of partial or inconsistent state, which when restored would cause merkle tree verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 187-194] [Version Confusion] Does StateSnapshotBackupController ensure the snapshot version matches the actual blockchain state version, or can version parameter manipulation create backups claiming to represent different ledger states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 196-205] [Transaction Tampering] In BackupType::Transaction execution, does TransactionBackupController cryptographically verify transaction authenticity before backup, or can modified transactions be backed up and later restored to corrupt chain history? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 197-204] [Range Attack] Can an attacker specify TransactionBackupOpt with crafted version ranges that cause the backup to include only selected transactions, enabling creation of forged blockchain history during restore? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 208-217] [Liveness Attack] In Command::Continuously handling, if BackupCoordinator.run() never returns due to infinite loop or deadlock, does this block critical node operations since run() consumes ownership of resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 209-216] [Storage Exhaustion] Does BackupCoordinator implement rate limiting to prevent continuous backup from filling all available storage space, potentially causing node failures when storage is exhausted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 209-216] [Backup Gap Attack] Can network interruptions during BackupCoordinator.run() create gaps in continuous backup coverage, allowing an attacker to exploit unrecoverable periods where state cannot be restored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 210-215] [Arc Reference Leak] When BackupCoordinator wraps BackupServiceClient in Arc, are there scenarios where circular references prevent proper cleanup, causing memory leaks in long-running coordinator processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 218-226] [Information Disclosure] In OneShotQueryType::NodeState handling, does client.get_db_state() expose sensitive internal state (uncommitted transactions, validator keys, pending state) that should not be accessible via backup CLI? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 219-225] [Service Impersonation] Can an attacker configure BackupServiceClientOpt to point to a malicious backup service that returns fraudulent db_state, misleading operators about actual node status? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 221-225] [State Confusion] When get_db_state() returns None (line 224), does the system properly handle the uninitialized state, or can this be exploited to trigger backups that capture invalid genesis state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/backup.rs] [Lines: 227-235] [Metadata Cache Poisoning] In OneShotQueryType::BackupStorageState, can an attacker manipulate the metadata cache during cache::sync_and_load() to return false storage state information, causing incorrect backup decisions?
