  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Encoding Issues] Does the line parsing handle non-UTF8 or malformed UTF8 sequences properly, or could invalid encodings cause panics or incorrect parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Magic Number Validation] Does the BCS deserialization validate any magic numbers or version headers, or will it attempt to deserialize arbitrary binary data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: output_map_to_file()] [Atomic Writes] Is the file write operation atomic? Could a crash during write_all() leave a corrupted partial file that breaks subsequent deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Line Length] Are there limits on line length in the trace file? Could extremely long lines (megabytes) cause excessive memory usage in BufReader? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Type: AccountAddress] [Address Validation] When parsing AccountAddress from hex literals, are there any restrictions on which addresses are valid? Could reserved/system addresses be used in coverage data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: update_coverage_from_trace_file()] [Context String Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious context strings with embedded '::' or ',' characters that break the parsing logic and inject fake module/function coverage data? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: from_binary_file()] [Deserialization Gadgets] Could carefully crafted BCS data exploit implementation details of the Serialize/Deserialize derives to trigger unintended behavior in the BTreeMap or Identifier types? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: into_coverage_map_with_modules()] [Module Spoofing] Can an attacker provide a modules map that associates legitimate module addresses/names with malicious CompiledModule instances to manipulate coverage analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: merge()] [Merge Order Dependency] Does the order in which coverage maps are merged affect the final result? Could an attacker exploit merge order to hide or amplify certain coverage data? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Function: to_unified_exec_map()] [Precision Loss] When unifying multiple execution maps, could coverage patterns from individual executions be lost, hiding important security-relevant execution paths? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Overall Design] [Trusted Input Assumption] The code appears to assume trusted input from trace files - if coverage tools are used in adversarial contexts (e.g., analyzing untrusted smart contracts), could malicious contracts generate trace files that exploit these vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Overall Design] [No Input Sanitization] There is minimal input validation or sanitization - should there be bounds checking on pc values, length limits on identifiers, or validation of address formats before processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Overall Design] [Error Recovery] Many operations use unwrap() which panics on error - in a production environment, should these be replaced with proper error handling to prevent DoS from malformed inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Overall Design] [Privilege Escalation] If this coverage tool runs with elevated privileges (e.g., as part of a validator's testing infrastructure), could file I/O vulnerabilities be escalated to system compromise? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/coverage_map.rs] [Overall Design] [Side Channel] Could coverage maps themselves leak sensitive information about execution patterns that could be used to infer private data or system behavior? (Low)"
