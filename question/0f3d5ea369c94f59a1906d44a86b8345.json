  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Missing Nonce] AuthRequest lacks a nonce or timestamp field for replay protection. Can captured AuthRequest messages be replayed indefinitely to obtain fresh JWTs, even if the original validator is offline? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [No Revocation] Claims structure has no jti (JWT ID) or revocation mechanism. If a validator key is compromised, can stolen JWTs continue to be used until they expire (up to 60 minutes), with no way to revoke them early? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [No Audience Claim] Claims lacks an 'aud' (audience) field. Can JWTs intended for the telemetry service be reused on other Aptos services if they share the same JWT signing key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [No Issuer Claim] Claims lacks an 'iss' (issuer) field. In multi-tenant deployments with multiple telemetry servers, can tokens from one server be used on another if they don't validate the issuer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Unbounded Authentication Rate] Without rate limiting fields in AuthRequest, can an attacker flood the authentication endpoint with millions of requests to exhaust JWT signing resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field chain_id] [Chain State Dependency] Claims validation depends on runtime state (current validator set for chain_id). If that state is unavailable, can authentication fail catastrophically, causing legitimate validators to be denied access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field epoch] [Epoch State Desync] If the telemetry service's view of the current epoch lags behind the actual blockchain epoch, can validators with fresh tokens (new epoch) be rejected, causing telemetry data loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [Stateless Validation Issue] Since Claims validation requires checking against current epoch and validator sets (stateful), can an attacker exploit stale state to authenticate with old JWTs that should be invalid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Fingerprinting] The combination of chain_id, peer_id, role_type fields in AuthRequest allows fingerprinting of validator nodes. Can passive network observers build a database of validator identities and their telemetry usage patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Content Exposure] JWTs are base64-encoded but not encrypted. Can network attackers decode Claims in transit to learn peer_id, chain_id, node_type, and epoch, enabling targeted attacks on specific validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field run_uuid] [Session Enumeration] If run_uuid follows a predictable pattern (sequential, timestamp-based), can attackers enumerate valid run_uuids and attempt to hijack validator sessions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Deserialization Panic] If serde deserialization of AuthRequest panics (e.g., on malformed input), can this crash the entire telemetry service, causing DoS for all validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims] [JWT Decode Panic] If Claims deserialization from JWT fails (corrupted token), are errors handled gracefully, or can panics crash request handlers and cause service instability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest field peer_id] [PeerId Type Safety] PeerId is a type alias for AccountAddress (32 bytes). Can type confusion between PeerId and other 32-byte types (public keys, hashes) lead to incorrect authentication decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest field chain_id] [ChainId Type Safety] ChainId wraps a u8. Can casting or arithmetic on ChainId cause unexpected behavior, such as treating testnet (id=2) as mainnet (id=1) due to off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest] [Protocol Version Missing] AuthRequest lacks a protocol version field. If authentication protocol evolves, can attackers force use of old, vulnerable protocol versions by omitting version negotiation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthResponse] [Response Downgrade] Without version negotiation, can a MitM attacker downgrade AuthResponse to use weaker JWT algorithms or shorter expiration times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field exp] [Year 2038 Problem] On 32-bit systems, Unix timestamps overflow in 2038 when exp exceeds i32::MAX. Can this cause Claims with far-future expiration to wrap to negative values, making them appear expired or causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims field iat] [Issued-At Backdating] Can an attacker set iat to a time far in the past (e.g., Unix epoch 0 = 1970-01-01) to make tokens appear to have been issued before the telemetry service existed, potentially bypassing rate limits or audit logs that track issuance time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: Claims fields exp and iat] [Negative Time Delta] If exp - iat is used to calculate token lifetime, can carefully crafted exp and iat values cause integer underflow, resulting in negative lifetimes that break validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/auth.rs] [Struct: AuthRequest field handshake_msg] [Compression Bomb] If handshake_msg is compressed/encoded, can an attacker send a small compressed payload that expands to gigabytes during decompression, causing memory exhaustion? (High)"
