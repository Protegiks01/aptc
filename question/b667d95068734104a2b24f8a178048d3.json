  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Error: None return silencing] When event_to_request() returns None for invalid events, are these events logged/counted for rate limiting, or can attackers spam invalid events without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Edge case: Empty network_events] If the network_events vector at line 44 is empty (no networks configured), does select_all() at line 49 handle this gracefully or cause immediate stream termination? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Edge case: Duplicate NetworkId] If into_network_and_events() at line 45 produces duplicate NetworkId values, can messages be processed twice from the same network? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Data flow: Message ownership] When NetworkMessage is created at lines 72-77 and 84-89, is consensus_observer_message moved or cloned? If moved, can this prevent message inspection for audit logging? (Low)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Crypto: Response integrity] When responses are serialized at line 126-128, are they signed or authenticated before being sent, or can man-in-the-middle attackers modify responses? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/network/network_events.rs] [Identity: Peer spoofing] Can peer_id values at lines 71 and 83 be forged by malicious network infrastructure to impersonate trusted validators? (Critical)",
