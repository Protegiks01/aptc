  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Deserialization vulnerability] Can an attacker provide malicious YAML/JSON with extremely long strings for listen_address or api_path_base during serde deserialization, causing memory exhaustion or buffer overflow attacks when the faucet server loads its configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Missing validation] Does ServerConfig perform any validation on the listen_address field to prevent binding to unintended network interfaces, or can an attacker modify configuration to bind the faucet to a public interface when it should be localhost-only? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Port validation] Is there any validation preventing listen_port from being set to privileged ports (0-1023) or system service ports, potentially causing conflicts with critical system services or requiring elevated privileges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Path injection] Does the api_path_base field validate against path traversal sequences (../, ..\\, etc.), or can an attacker inject malicious paths that escape the intended API routing structure when configuration is loaded from untrusted sources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_address()] [Network exposure] The default listen_address is '0.0.0.0' which exposes the faucet to all network interfaces - can this lead to unintended public exposure of faucet endpoints in production environments where the faucet should only be accessible internally? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Unicode validation] Does the serde deserialization validate that listen_address and api_path_base contain only valid ASCII/UTF-8 characters, or can attackers inject null bytes, control characters, or homograph attacks through Unicode confusables? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit serde's type flexibility to provide unexpected types (e.g., numbers as strings, objects as strings) for listen_address or api_path_base that bypass validation in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [SSRF via listen_address] If listen_address accepts domain names instead of IP addresses, can an attacker craft a malicious hostname that causes SSRF attacks when the faucet server attempts DNS resolution and binding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [API path manipulation] Can the api_path_base be set to special values like '/' or empty string that cause routing conflicts, allowing attackers to shadow legitimate endpoints or bypass authentication/authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Port range validation] Is listen_port validated to be within the valid port range (1-65535), or can integer overflow/underflow during deserialization cause port 0 or negative values that lead to undefined binding behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Race condition] When ServerConfig is cloned and used across multiple threads in the faucet server, can race conditions in accessing listen_address or api_path_base during server startup cause inconsistent binding behavior or partial configuration application? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Configuration injection] If ServerConfig is loaded from environment variables or command-line arguments in addition to files, can attackers inject malicious values that override secure defaults through environment variable poisoning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_port()] [Port conflict] The default port 10212 may conflict with other services - can attackers exploit this to cause the faucet to fail binding, then intercept traffic meant for the faucet by running a malicious service on that port first? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Missing authentication config] ServerConfig only defines network binding parameters but no authentication or authorization fields - can this lead to deployments where the faucet is exposed without proper access controls if operators forget to configure separate auth mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [TLS/encryption missing] There are no fields for TLS configuration (certificates, keys) - does this mean the faucet always operates over unencrypted HTTP, exposing sensitive transaction data and private keys to network sniffing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_api_path_base()] [Empty path default] The default api_path_base is an empty string - can this cause the API to be mounted at the root path '/', making it impossible to separate public endpoints from admin endpoints or health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [IPv6 support] Does listen_address properly handle IPv6 addresses with brackets [::], or can malformed IPv6 strings cause parsing errors that lead to binding failures or incorrect network interface selection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Wildcard injection] Can listen_address accept wildcard patterns like '*.example.com' that cause the server to bind to unintended interfaces or create security vulnerabilities through overly permissive binding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Path normalization] Is api_path_base normalized to handle trailing slashes, duplicate slashes, or dot segments consistently, or can inconsistent normalization lead to routing bypasses or endpoint shadowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [Configuration reload] If the faucet supports hot-reloading of ServerConfig, can an attacker exploit TOCTOU vulnerabilities by modifying the config file between validation and application, causing the server to bind to malicious addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_address()] [Insecure default] Using '0.0.0.0' as the default exposes the service to all interfaces - is this secure-by-default design, or should it default to '127.0.0.1' to prevent accidental public exposure in misconfigured deployments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_port()] [Port enumeration] Using a predictable default port 10212 makes the faucet easily discoverable through port scanning - can attackers use this to identify and target faucet instances for exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_api_path_base()] [Versioning missing] The default api_path_base is empty rather than versioned (e.g., '/v1') - does this make it difficult to introduce breaking changes or security updates to the API without breaking existing clients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No rate limiting config] ServerConfig lacks fields for rate limiting or request throttling - can this lead to faucet abuse where attackers drain funds by making unlimited requests, since rate limiting must be configured separately? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No CORS config] There are no CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration fields - can this lead to either overly permissive CORS that enables XSS attacks, or overly restrictive CORS that breaks legitimate use cases? (Medium)"
