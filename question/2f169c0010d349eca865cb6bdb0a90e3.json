  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Trait: AsMoveValue] [Gas metering bypass] When converting to MoveValue, are the Vec<u8> fields properly metered for gas? Can extremely large payloads bypass gas limits and cause free storage or computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Trait: AsMoveValue] [Move resource safety] Does the conversion maintain Move's resource safety guarantees? Can multiple Rust-side references to the same UnsupportedJWK violate Move's linear type system when converted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Equivocation] Can a Byzantine validator propose two different UnsupportedJWKs with the same id but different payloads to different honest validators, causing consensus to accept conflicting JWK states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Replay attack] Since there's no timestamp or nonce in the struct, can old UnsupportedJWKs be replayed in later epochs to reintroduce deleted or outdated keys, bypassing security updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Version confusion] Without version information in the struct itself, can different versions of UnsupportedJWKs for the same id cause confusion about which is the current valid key during consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Delete command bypass] When an UnsupportedJWK with payload equal to DELETE_COMMAND_INDICATOR is used (as seen in types/src/jwks/mod.rs line 321), can an attacker craft a legitimate JWK that happens to have this exact payload, causing it to be incorrectly treated as a deletion command? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Delete injection] Can an attacker inject UnsupportedJWKs with the DELETE_COMMAND_INDICATOR payload to maliciously delete legitimate JWKs from the consensus state, breaking keyless authentication for users? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Command confusion] If the DELETE_COMMAND_INDICATOR check is case-sensitive or encoding-sensitive, can attackers use alternative encodings (UTF-8 vs ASCII, different capitalizations) to bypass deletion detection or inject false deletions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: new_for_testing()] [Production leakage] The new_for_testing() function at lines 29-35 is gated by cfg(any(test, feature = 'fuzzing')). If the 'fuzzing' feature is accidentally enabled in production builds, can this allow arbitrary JWK creation bypassing proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: new_with_payload()] [Test function exposure] Similarly, new_with_payload() at lines 37-44 is test-gated. Can feature flag misconfiguration expose this in production, allowing creation of UnsupportedJWKs without proper consensus validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Trait: PartialEq/Eq] [Equality bypass] The struct derives PartialEq and Eq at line 13. Is equality based on byte-exact comparison? Can two semantically identical JWKs with different byte representations (e.g., different JSON whitespace) be treated as different, causing state duplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Trait: PartialEq/Eq] [Hash consistency] Does the Eq implementation remain consistent with any Hash implementations? Can hash table lookups fail if equality and hashing use different criteria for comparing UnsupportedJWKs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Authentication bypass] When keyless validation encounters an UnsupportedJWK (as seen in keyless_validation.rs), does it properly reject the authentication? Can an attacker force their transactions to use UnsupportedJWKs to bypass signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Error handling bypass] If keyless validation fails to properly handle the UnsupportedJWK case, can this lead to default-allow behavior where unsupported keys are incorrectly accepted as valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: id()] [Type safety] The id() function returns KID which is type-aliased to Vec<u8>. Can type confusion between different Vec<u8> usages (id vs payload vs issuer) cause security issues in JWK lookup operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: id()] [Empty id handling] Can id() return an empty Vec<u8>? If so, how do lookup mechanisms handle empty ids - could this cause all JWKs with empty ids to collide and overwrite each other in hash maps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Race condition] If multiple threads access and clone UnsupportedJWKs concurrently during consensus, can race conditions in Vec<u8> allocation cause data corruption or use-after-free bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Thread safety] The struct doesn't implement Send/Sync explicitly. Are there any internal references or raw pointers that could violate thread safety when UnsupportedJWKs are passed between consensus threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Empty payload] Can an UnsupportedJWK have an empty payload Vec<u8>? If so, does SHA3-256 hash of empty bytes create a valid id that could collide with other uses of empty hash values in the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Null bytes in id] Can the id field contain null bytes that might terminate strings early in C FFI boundaries or cause issues in database keys using the id as identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [All-zero payload] If payload is all zero bytes, does this have special meaning anywhere in the system that could be exploited, similar to the DELETE_COMMAND_INDICATOR pattern? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Lookup collision] When get_jwk() in ProviderJWKs (types/src/jwks/mod.rs:179) compares unsupported_jwk.id with id.as_bytes(), can byte-encoding differences cause legitimate lookups to fail or malicious lookups to succeed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Struct: UnsupportedJWK] [Index poisoning] If UnsupportedJWKs are stored in ProviderJWKsIndexed hash maps keyed by id, can hash collisions or malicious ids cause legitimate JWKs to be overwritten or made inaccessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: new_with_payload()] [Hash algorithm confusion] If the system is upgraded to use a different hash algorithm in the future, can old UnsupportedJWKs with SHA3-256 ids be confused with new ones using a different algorithm, causing security downgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/jwks/unsupported/mod.rs] [Function: From<serde_json::Value>] [Side-channel attack] Does the SHA3-256 hashing operation leak timing information about the payload content through cache timing or branch prediction, potentially revealing sensitive JWK material? (Low)"
