  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Struct: GasEstimationStaticOverride] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide a configuration with u64::MAX values for low, market, or aggressive fields causing integer overflow in downstream arithmetic operations during gas price calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Struct: GasEstimationStaticOverride] [Economic attack] Can a malicious node operator set static_override.low = u64::MAX to cause all user transactions to fail gas validation, effectively creating a denial of service on transaction acceptance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Struct: GasEstimationStaticOverride] [Economic manipulation] Can static_override values be set to 0, allowing transactions to be processed with zero gas fees and breaking the economic security model of the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Struct: GasEstimationStaticOverride] [Invariant violation] Are there any validations that ensure low <= market <= aggressive? If not, can reversed values cause incorrect gas estimation responses that mislead users into paying incorrect fees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Struct: GasEstimationStaticOverride] [Deserialization attack] Can malformed YAML/TOML configuration files with negative numbers be deserialized into valid u64 values through wrapping, bypassing intended constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: enabled] [Configuration manipulation] If enabled=false, does the API return default gas estimates that could be significantly inaccurate during network congestion, causing user transaction failures and potential loss of funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: enabled] [State inconsistency] Can validators run with different enabled settings, leading to inconsistent gas estimation responses across API nodes and causing user confusion or failed transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: enabled] [Hot reload attack] If configuration can be reloaded without restart, can rapid toggling of enabled field cause race conditions in cached gas estimation data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: static_override] [Economic attack] Can a compromised node operator set static_override to extremely high values (near u64::MAX) to make the network appear prohibitively expensive, driving users away and damaging network adoption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: static_override] [Network partition] If different validators use different static_override values, can this lead to gas estimation inconsistencies that fragment user experience across different API endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: static_override] [Type confusion] Is there proper None/Some handling to prevent accessing invalid memory when static_override is None but code assumes Some? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: static_override] [Bypass attack] Can setting static_override bypass the cache_expiration_ms mechanism entirely, allowing stale gas prices to persist indefinitely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: static_override] [Economic manipulation] Can an attacker use static_override to set gas prices below the actual minimum required, causing users to submit transactions that will never be included in blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: full_block_txns] [Integer overflow] Can setting full_block_txns to usize::MAX cause overflow when compared with transaction counts retrieved from the database? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: full_block_txns] [Economic attack] Can setting full_block_txns = 0 cause all blocks to be classified as 'full', artificially inflating gas price estimates and making the network appear congested when it's not? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: full_block_txns] [Default value: 250] Is the default value of 250 transactions validated against actual block capacity? Can this mismatch cause incorrect gas estimation when block limits change? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: full_block_txns] [Logic error] Can setting full_block_txns higher than maximum possible block size cause gas prices to never increase even during actual congestion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: full_block_txns] [Validation bypass] Does the sanitize() function validate that full_block_txns > 0? If not, can zero or very small values break gas estimation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: low_block_history] [Validation bypass] While sanitize() checks for zero, can an attacker set low_block_history = 1 to make gas estimation extremely volatile and manipulable by controlling a single block? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: low_block_history] [Default value: 10] Can the default of 10 blocks be insufficient during rapid network condition changes, causing users to underpay and have transactions rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/gas_estimation_config.rs] [Field: low_block_history] [Integer overflow] Can setting low_block_history to usize::MAX cause memory exhaustion when attempting to allocate vectors to store block data? (High)",
