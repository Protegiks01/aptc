  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteExecutionResult] [Deserialization attack] Can a malicious remote executor shard send a crafted BCS-serialized RemoteExecutionResult with deeply nested Vec structures causing stack overflow during deserialization, leading to coordinator node crash and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteExecutionResult] [Result manipulation] Does RemoteExecutionResult properly validate that Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> has consistent lengths matching the expected sub-block structure, or can a Byzantine shard return mismatched output counts causing state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteExecutionResult] [Error handling bypass] Can an attacker craft a RemoteExecutionResult with Err(VMStatus) containing a misleading error code that causes the coordinator to incorrectly retry or skip critical validation steps, potentially accepting invalid execution results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Function: RemoteExecutionResult::new()] [Type confusion] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on the inner Result type, or can malformed VMStatus values be injected that later cause panics during error handling in consensus code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteExecutionResult] [Memory exhaustion] Can a malicious shard send RemoteExecutionResult with extremely large Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> (e.g., billions of empty outputs) causing coordinator OOM and network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteExecutionResult] [Clone attack] Since RemoteExecutionResult derives Clone, can the same execution result be reused across multiple blocks to create duplicate state transitions or bypass gas accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Enum: RemoteExecutionRequest] [Enum extension attack] If additional enum variants are added to RemoteExecutionRequest in future versions, can old executor shards misinterpret new command types, leading to state divergence between nodes running different versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Enum: RemoteExecutionRequest::ExecuteBlock] [Command replay] Does the RemoteExecutionRequest contain any nonce or sequence number to prevent replay attacks, or can a coordinator send the same ExecuteBlock command multiple times causing duplicate execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Enum: RemoteExecutionRequest] [Deserialization bypass] Can an attacker send a BCS-encoded RemoteExecutionRequest that deserializes to an unexpected variant beyond ExecuteBlock, bypassing validation logic that only checks for ExecuteBlock commands? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Shard confusion] Can a malicious coordinator send ExecuteBlockCommand with SubBlocksForShard containing transactions belonging to different ShardIds, causing executor shards to execute transactions from other shards and corrupt global state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Concurrency overflow] Does ExecuteBlockCommand validate that concurrency_level is within safe bounds, or can a coordinator set it to usize::MAX causing integer overflow in thread pool allocation and node crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Config injection] Can a Byzantine coordinator inject malicious BlockExecutorConfigFromOnchain values (e.g., zero gas limits, disabled safety checks) that cause executor shards to produce invalid state transitions accepted as valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Function: ExecuteBlockCommand::into()] [Ownership transfer] Does into() properly transfer ownership without leaving dangling references, or can race conditions during destructuring cause use-after-free when multiple threads access the command simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Empty block attack] Can ExecuteBlockCommand be sent with empty sub_blocks Vec causing executor shards to produce zero outputs, which might be incorrectly aggregated as successful empty execution rather than error condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [AnalyzedTransaction manipulation] Since sub_blocks contains AnalyzedTransaction types, can pre-analysis results be forged to bypass dependency analysis in Block-STM, causing transaction conflicts to be missed and leading to non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Concurrency race] If concurrency_level changes between blocks, can race conditions in thread pool reconfiguration cause some transactions to execute with wrong concurrency settings, leading to different state roots across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ExecuteBlockCommand] [Config inconsistency] Can different executor shards receive different onchain_config values from a Byzantine coordinator, causing deterministic execution to produce different results across shards and break state consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVRequest] [Shard mismatch] Can RemoteKVRequest be crafted with incorrect shard_id values that don't match the requesting shard, causing state values to be fetched from wrong shards and resulting in incorrect transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVRequest] [Key enumeration] Can a malicious executor shard send RemoteKVRequest with keys Vec containing all possible StateKeys to enumerate the entire state database, violating privacy and causing DoS through excessive state queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Function: RemoteKVRequest::new()] [Duplicate keys] Does new() deduplicate the keys Vec, or can duplicate StateKeys cause the same state value to be fetched multiple times, wasting network bandwidth and processing time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Function: RemoteKVRequest::into()] [Tuple destructuring] Can the into() method be called multiple times through Clone, causing ownership confusion where the same keys are processed by multiple handlers concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVRequest] [Empty keys attack] Can RemoteKVRequest with empty keys Vec bypass validation and cause state view service to return empty responses that are incorrectly cached, leading to missing state access during transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVRequest] [StateKey validity] Are StateKeys in the keys Vec validated to ensure they conform to expected formats, or can malformed keys cause panics in state database lookups or Merkle proof generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVRequest] [Shard ID bounds] Is shard_id validated to be within the valid range [0, num_shards), or can out-of-bounds shard IDs cause array index panics when routing requests to executor shards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/lib.rs] [Struct: RemoteKVResponse] [Response ordering] Does RemoteKVResponse maintain the same ordering of state values as the requested keys, or can reordering cause state values to be associated with wrong keys during transaction execution? (Critical)"
