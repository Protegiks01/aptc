  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Static: PARANOID_TYPE_CHECKS] [Race condition] Can multiple threads concurrently call set_paranoid_type_checks() during node initialization, causing a race condition where the OnceCell.set().ok() silently discards the intended security setting, allowing type checks to be disabled when they should be enabled? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Static: ASYNC_RUNTIME_CHECKS] [Race condition] Can an attacker trigger concurrent calls to set_async_runtime_checks() during epoch transitions, causing OnceCell to accept only the first value and silently ignore security-critical configuration updates?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: get_async_runtime_checks()] [Default value attack] The default return value is false when uninitialized - can this allow an attacker to force synchronous checks during high-throughput blocks, causing performance degradation and validator timeouts?
