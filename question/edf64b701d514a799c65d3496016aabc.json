  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Signature Validation] Does last_vote store validated signatures, or can invalid signatures in last_vote cause validators to think they voted when signature verification would fail? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Signature Stripping] Can last_vote have its signature stripped/modified after being stored in SafetyData, allowing vote manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Signature Malleability] Can last_vote signatures be malleated to create different but valid signatures for the same vote data, causing equivocation detection issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Type Safety] Are epoch and round fields properly distinct types, or can they be confused/swapped causing validators to vote in wrong epoch/round? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Type Coercion] Can round number fields (last_voted_round, preferred_round) be implicitly coerced to/from other integer types causing truncation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Newtype Pattern] Should epoch and round be newtype wrappers instead of raw u64 to prevent accidental misuse? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Option Unwrap] Can unwrapping last_vote without checking is_some() cause panics in hot consensus paths? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: last_vote] [Option Abuse] Can last_vote being Some vs None be exploited to create ambiguous voting states? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker set last_voted_round to u64::MAX preventing further voting and halting consensus progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Liveness Attack] Can preferred_round be set extremely high (near u64::MAX) making it impossible to propose valid blocks that extend it? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Liveness Attack] Can one_chain_round be manipulated to cause all proposals to be rejected as not extending the 1-chain, halting progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Field: highest_timeout_round] [Liveness Attack] Can highest_timeout_round be set to u64::MAX preventing timeout certificates from being signed, causing consensus to halt? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Liveness Attack] Can epoch be stuck at u64::MAX preventing epoch transitions and validator set updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Handling] Does new() return Result or panic on invalid inputs, and can panics in constructor crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Trait: Display] [Error Handling] Does Display::fmt return errors correctly, or can formatting failures be silently ignored losing audit trail? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Error Handling] Can serialization fail mid-way leaving partial data in storage, and is this recoverable? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Error Handling] Can deserialization failures cause validators to halt instead of using safe default SafetyData? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Boundary Conditions] Are all edge cases tested: epoch=0, rounds=0, rounds=u64::MAX, None votes, empty states? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Null Pointer] Can last_vote Option<Vote> contain null/uninitialized pointers in unsafe contexts? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [3-Chain Rule] Can preferred_round tracking be bypassed to violate the 3-chain commit rule, allowing uncommitted blocks to be treated as committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [2-Chain Rule] Can one_chain_round be manipulated to violate the 2-chain rule, breaking Aptos's safety-liveness tradeoff? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [QC Verification] Does SafetyData enforce that preferred_round and one_chain_round only update when valid QCs are observed, or can they be set arbitrarily? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Leader Election] Can SafetyData be manipulated to cause validators to vote for proposals from non-leaders, bypassing leader election? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/safety_data.rs] [Struct: SafetyData] [Round Skipping] Can last_voted_round skip rounds (vote at round 10 then round 15), and does this break any consensus invariants? (High)",
