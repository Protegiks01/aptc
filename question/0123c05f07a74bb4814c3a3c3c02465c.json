  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Error handling] Multiple functions return Result<_, PanicError> - if PanicError is not properly handled by calling code, can this cause validator crashes and network liveness failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Error handling] Can PanicError be triggered intentionally by malicious input to cause DoS by crashing validator threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Error handling] Do V1 and V2 paths return PanicError for the same error conditions, or can error handling differences cause state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Error handling] If wake_dependencies_and_decrease_validation_idx() returns PanicError, are dependent transactions properly cleaned up, or can they remain in waiting state forever? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Concurrency] The Copy trait allows multiple SchedulerWrapper instances to exist - can concurrent access through different copies violate scheduler internal invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Concurrency] Are all functions in SchedulerWrapper thread-safe when called concurrently from multiple worker threads, or can races corrupt scheduler state? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [MVHashMap] In abort_pre_final_reexecution() and prepare_for_block_epilogue(), can corrupted versioned_cache entries cause update_transaction_on_abort() to write invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [MVHashMap] Can concurrent access to the same MVHashMap from multiple scheduler wrapper calls cause read/write set corruption or lost updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [MVHashMap] Are MVHashMap operations in abort_pre_final_reexecution() atomic with respect to scheduler state updates, or can partial rollbacks leave inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Block epilogue] Can prepare_for_block_epilogue() be called before all regular transactions complete, causing epilogue to execute with incomplete block state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Block epilogue] If prepare_for_block_epilogue() fails with PanicError, can the block still be finalized without proper epilogue execution, missing critical operations like fee distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Block epilogue] Does block_epilogue_idx need to equal num_transactions - 1, or can it reference an arbitrary transaction position causing epilogue to execute too early? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Module validation] Can an attacker craft transactions that repeatedly toggle skip_module_reads_validation, causing validation overhead to degrade block execution performance below liveness thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Module validation] If record_validation_requirements() is never called for transactions that publish modules, can this cause module reads to be incorrectly skipped in validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Module validation] Can the BTreeSet<ModuleId> in record_validation_requirements() contain duplicate or invalid module IDs that cause validation logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/scheduler_wrapper.rs] [Dependency] Can wait_for_dependency() be called with dep_txn_idx > txn_idx, creating forward dependencies that violate transaction execution ordering? (High)",
