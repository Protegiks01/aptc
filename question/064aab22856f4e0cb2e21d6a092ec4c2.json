  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Static Variable: USE_HELPFUL_ERRORS] [Runtime Modification] Although OnceCell allows only one-time initialization, can any code path re-initialize or modify USE_HELPFUL_ERRORS after it's set, potentially changing security configuration mid-operation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Enum: AptosTapErrorCode] [Repr Integer] At line 114, the #[repr(u32)] attribute ensures error codes fit in u32 - but does casting to u32 at line 81 properly handle all possible enum variants without truncation or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Enum: RejectionReasonCode] [Repr Integer] At line 236, does #[repr(u32)] ensure rejection codes don't conflict with error codes, given they use different discriminant ranges? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Struct: AptosTapError] [Error Trait] At line 87, implementing std::error::Error allows AptosTapError to be used with ? operator - but does this properly propagate all security-relevant error information through error chains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Function: From<AptosTapError>] [Trait Implementation] At line 100, does the From trait implementation consume the AptosTapError by value, preventing the same error from being logged multiple times while ensuring metrics are only incremented once? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Function: bump_rejection_reason_counters] [Metrics Observability] At line 105, if bump_rejection_reason_counters() silently fails or returns an error, is this failure logged or monitored, or can metrics gaps go unnoticed allowing abuse patterns to evade detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Function: Display::fmt()] [Log Injection] At line 79-82, when errors are logged via Display trait, can malicious message or rejection_reason content inject fake log entries or exploit log parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Static Variable: USE_HELPFUL_ERRORS] [Testing Isolation] At line 10, does using a global OnceCell cause test isolation issues where one test's configuration affects others, potentially hiding bugs or creating flaky security tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Enum: AptosTapErrorCode] [Auth Token Validation] At lines 138, 180, does AuthTokenInvalid error return 403 FORBIDDEN, and is this status code properly distinguished from other 403 errors like Rejected, or can clients not determine if they need to refresh tokens vs. change behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/errors.rs] [Enum: RejectionReasonCode] [Auth Token Rejection] At line 263, does the AuthTokenInvalid rejection reason properly distinguish between missing tokens, expired tokens, invalid signatures, and unauthorized tokens, or does lumping these together leak information? (Low)"
