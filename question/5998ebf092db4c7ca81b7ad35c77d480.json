  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Borrow Checker Bypass] If consuming code uses unsafe to bypass borrow checker and mutates validators Vec while it's borrowed, can this cause memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformance] [Default Values] Does Rust's Default trait implementation create ValidatorPerformance with zeroed counters, and can this be exploited to reset validator history by replacing instances with defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Iterator Safety] When iterating over validators Vec, can concurrent modifications cause iterator invalidation leading to skipped entries or duplicate processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Storage Consistency] When persisting validators Vec to AptosDB, can partial writes during crashes leave the data in an inconsistent state with some validators updated and others not? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformance] [Storage Corruption] Can storage layer errors cause successful_proposals or failed_proposals to be read back with corrupted values that differ from what was written? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Merkle Tree Integrity] Is the validators Vec properly committed to the Jellyfish Merkle tree state root, or can it be modified without updating the state commitment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [State Proof] Can state proofs for validator performance data be forged or manipulated to show false performance records to light clients? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformance] [Schema Evolution] During protocol upgrades, can changes to ValidatorPerformance schema cause deserialization failures of old performance data, losing historical records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Backward Compatibility] If new fields are added to ValidatorPerformance, can old nodes fail to deserialize ValidatorPerformances from upgraded nodes, causing consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Migration Attack] During data migration to a new performance tracking schema, can attackers inject false performance data or corrupt existing records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformance] [Zero Division] If successful_proposals and failed_proposals are both zero, can calculations like success rate cause division by zero panics in consuming code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformance] [Negative Performance] Does the u64 type prevent negative values, but can underflow during subtraction operations in consuming code wrap to u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_performances.rs] [Struct: ValidatorPerformances] [Duplicate Validators] If the same ValidatorPerformance instance appears multiple times in the validators Vec, can this cause double-counting in aggregate calculations? (High)"
