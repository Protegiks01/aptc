  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: non_empty_group_transaction_tests()] [Small universe edge case] The 'small universe group test' uses only 15 keys - could this hide scalability bugs or hash collision issues that only appear with larger key spaces in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Function: non_empty_group_transaction_tests()] [TransactionGenParams dynamic] Using TransactionGenParams::new_dynamic() - what transaction patterns does this generate, and could it miss adversarial transaction sequences that exploit block executor vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Test coverage] None of the tests exercise delayed_field_testing=true - could this leave critical delayed field handling bugs undetected in production resource groups that handle aggregator v2 operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Concurrency] Do tests verify that parallel and sequential execution produce identical state roots, or could they produce different but both 'valid' outputs, hiding consensus divergence bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Resource exhaustion] Are there limits on universe_size * transaction_count to prevent test memory exhaustion, and do production systems have equivalent safeguards against resource exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Group key selection] All tests use the last 3 keys as group keys - could malicious transactions that specifically target these positions exploit vulnerabilities that other group key arrangements would catch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Error propagation] Does assert_parallel_output properly validate all error cases, or could certain error types be treated as success, hiding critical failures in production execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: State consistency] If parallel execution produces incorrect results that happen to match the baseline (both wrong), would tests catch this, or could systematic bugs go undetected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Gas metering] Are gas calculations deterministic between parallel and sequential execution, or could gas metering differences cause state divergence that breaks consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Transaction ordering] Do tests verify that transaction execution order is preserved in parallel execution, or could reordering cause double-spending or other security issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Group size queries] The group_size_pcts parameter controls group size queries - do tests verify production code handles malicious queries that request impossibly large group sizes to cause resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: BlockExecutorConfig] Tests use BlockExecutorConfig::new_no_block_limit - could this hide bugs that only appear when block limits are enforced, causing validator disagreement on limit-exceeded blocks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Module cache] AptosModuleCacheManagerGuard::none() is used - could missing module cache testing hide bugs where module caching causes non-deterministic execution or stale module use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Transaction slice metadata] TransactionSliceMetadata::unknown() is used - could missing metadata cause security checks to be bypassed in production code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Cross-function: Commit hook] NoOpTransactionCommitHook is used - could actual commit hooks have side effects that cause non-deterministic behavior or state corruption not caught by tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Edge case: Zero transactions] Are there tests with transaction_count=0, and does production code handle empty blocks correctly without crashing or corrupting state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Edge case: Maximum values] Do tests exercise maximum universe_size and transaction_count values to verify production code handles large blocks without integer overflow or memory exhaustion? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Edge case: Single execution] Some test cases use num_executions_sequential=5 - is this sufficient to catch non-deterministic bugs, or could they require many more iterations to manifest? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Attack vector: Malicious transactions] Do generated transactions include adversarial patterns like cyclic dependencies, write-write conflicts on group keys, or transactions that deliberately trigger worst-case parallel execution performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Attack vector: Group key conflicts] Could malicious transactions specifically target group keys to create maximum contention, causing parallel executor to degrade to sequential performance and enabling DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Attack vector: Gas limit manipulation] Could an attacker craft transactions that pass gas limit checks in testing but exceed limits in production due to gas calculation differences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/combinatorial_tests/group_tests.rs] [Attack vector: Resource group corruption] Could concurrent writes to the same resource group key by multiple transactions cause corruption, and do tests verify the production executor handles this atomically? (Critical)",
