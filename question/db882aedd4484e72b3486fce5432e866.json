  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Disk I/O] Can frequent stats_dump_period_sec values (e.g., 1 second) cause excessive disk writes that interfere with consensus-critical database operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [File Descriptor Leaks] If max_open_files is set too high and RocksDB opens many files, can this exhaust the system's file descriptor limit and affect other validator components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [WAL Contention] If max_total_wal_size is too small for high transaction throughput, can WAL compaction become a bottleneck that delays block commits and affects consensus timing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Privilege Escalation] If readonly=false is used when the process should only have read access, can this allow unauthorized state modifications that bypass access control checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Data Tampering] Can a malicious operator modify the RocksdbConfig to disable safety features (e.g., setting max_total_wal_size very high to prevent WAL rotation), making crash recovery impossible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Audit Trail] Does statistics collection (when enabled) log sensitive information about transaction patterns that could be used for chain analysis or validator profiling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Side Channel] Can statistics dump timing or file creation patterns leak information about validator activity to local observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Config Validation] Does the upstream RocksdbConfig struct validate its fields before being passed to gen_rocksdb_options(), or can invalid configurations reach this function? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [State Store Coupling] If the state store expects certain Options to be set but they are not configured here, can this cause silent failures or corruption in state operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Merkle Tree Integration] Do these RocksDB options affect how Jellyfish Merkle Tree data is persisted, and can incorrect settings cause Merkle proof verification failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Snapshot Consistency] Can these options affect the consistency of state snapshots used for fast sync, potentially causing new validators to start with corrupted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Pruning Interaction] Do max_open_files or max_total_wal_size settings interact with state pruning logic in ways that could cause premature deletion of necessary historical data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Missing Validation] Should gen_rocksdb_options() perform validation of config parameters to ensure they are within safe ranges before applying them to RocksDB? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Return Type] Should the function return Result<Options, Error> instead of Options to propagate configuration errors to the caller? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Immutable Configuration] Should the generated Options be marked as immutable or sealed to prevent further modification after creation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Logging] Should this function log the applied configuration for audit purposes, especially for security-critical settings like readonly mode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Testing] Are there comprehensive tests ensuring that all configuration combinations produce valid, deterministic database behavior across different environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Column Family Mismatch] When create_missing_column_families(true) is set, can an attacker provide a config that causes RocksDB to create unexpected column families that interfere with state storage logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Statistics Buffer Overflow] If stats_dump_period_sec is 0 or very small, can the statistics buffer overflow before being dumped, causing memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Environment Sharing] If the same Env is shared across multiple RocksDB instances (e.g., different databases), can this cause resource contention or deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Platform Dependencies] Are there platform-specific (Linux vs Windows) behaviors in RocksDB that could cause these options to behave differently, leading to cross-platform state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Filesystem Limitations] Can max_open_files exceed filesystem limits (e.g., ulimit on Linux), causing RocksDB to fail during normal operation rather than at startup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [WAL Rotation] If max_total_wal_size is reached during a large batch write (e.g., during state sync), can WAL rotation block the write operation indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Readonly Enforcement] If readonly=true is set but the database file permissions allow writes, will RocksDB enforce readonly mode or silently allow writes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/rocksdb-options/src/lib.rs] [Function: gen_rocksdb_options()] [Statistics Cardinality] Can the number of statistics tracked grow unbounded over time, causing memory leaks in long-running validator nodes? (Medium)"
