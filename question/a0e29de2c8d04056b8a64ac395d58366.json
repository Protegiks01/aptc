  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: handle_dump_consensus_db_request()] [Missing Authentication] Does this endpoint implement ANY authentication or authorization checks before allowing consensus database dumps, or can any attacker with network access to the admin service extract complete consensus state including last_vote, highest_tc, all blocks, and QCs, enabling them to analyze consensus patterns for strategic Byzantine attacks? (Critical)",
