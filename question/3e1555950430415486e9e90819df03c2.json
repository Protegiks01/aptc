  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Command Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious commands through the Args::parse() clap parser by crafting specially formatted command-line arguments that bypass validation, potentially executing arbitrary code or manipulating transaction emission behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Handling] Does the panic! on error at lines 89 and 98 leak sensitive information about internal cluster state, validator endpoints, or account keys that could be exploited for reconnaissance by an attacker monitoring error output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async Race Condition] In the tokio::main async runtime, can concurrent command executions lead to shared state corruption when multiple instances of the transaction emitter run simultaneously against the same cluster, causing nonce conflicts or double-spending? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the Logger::builder() at line 76 impose limits on log size, or can an attacker trigger excessive logging through rapid command invocations, filling disk space and causing denial of service on the emitter host? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Uncontrolled Unwrap] The .unwrap() calls at lines 90 and 99 after panic! are redundant but indicate potential panic paths - can an attacker trigger these panics through malformed cluster_args or emit_args, causing the emitter to crash mid-execution and leave transactions in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Transaction Manipulation] Can an attacker modify emit_workload_args.args_to_transaction_mix_per_phase() to inject malicious transaction types that weren't intended by the operator, potentially draining funds from the coin source account? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Integer Overflow] Does the stats.rate() calculation at line 92 properly handle division by zero or overflow when computing transaction rates, or can extreme emission patterns cause arithmetic errors that misrepresent actual throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [State Leakage] Does printing stats at lines 91-92 to stdout expose sensitive information about validator performance, transaction patterns, or network topology that could be used by an attacker to time attacks or identify weak nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Fund Exhaustion] If emit_transactions runs indefinitely or for extended periods, can an attacker observe the coin source account's balance depletion pattern to predict when it will run out, then front-run critical transactions during the refill window? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - EmitTx branch] [Cluster Args Manipulation] Can malicious cluster_args specify adversarial validator endpoints that respond with forged transaction confirmations, causing the emitter to believe transactions succeeded when they didn't, leading to incorrect performance metrics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Account Hijacking] Can an attacker intercept or predict the account creation parameters in create_accounts_args to pre-create accounts with the same addresses, then claim the funds intended for load testing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Resource Exhaustion] Does create_accounts_command impose limits on the number of accounts created, or can an attacker specify arbitrarily large account counts that exhaust coin source funds or cause state bloat in the target cluster? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Key Management] Are the private keys for created accounts properly secured, or are they logged/stored in plaintext where an attacker with file system access could steal all test account keys and drain funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Nonce Race Condition] If multiple create_accounts_command invocations run concurrently against the same coin source account, can they conflict on sequence numbers, causing some account creations to fail or be duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - CreateAccounts branch] [Error Handling Bypass] The panic! at line 98 terminates the process on failure - can an attacker trigger partial account creation where some accounts are funded but not all, leaving the emitter in an inconsistent state for subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - Diag branch] [Cluster Validation Bypass] Does Cluster::try_from_cluster_args() at line 103 properly validate endpoint URLs, or can an attacker supply malicious URLs (e.g., localhost, internal IPs) to probe internal network services through the emitter as a proxy? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - Diag branch] [SSRF Attack] Can cluster_args point to attacker-controlled endpoints that return crafted responses to diag(), causing the emitter to make additional unintended requests to other internal services? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - Diag branch] [Context Error Leakage] Does the .context() error message at line 105 expose internal cluster configuration, validator IP addresses, or authentication tokens that could aid an attacker in reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - Diag branch] [Diagnostic Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the diag() function's behavior by controlling responses from cluster nodes, causing false positives/negatives in health checks that hide actual network issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - PingEndPoints branch] [Incomplete Validation] The PingEndPoints command only calls try_from_cluster_args() without actually pinging - is this a security issue where the command claims success but doesn't verify endpoint reachability, allowing operators to deploy against unreachable clusters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - PingEndPoints branch] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Even if endpoints are reachable at ping time, can they become unavailable immediately after, causing subsequent operations to fail in ways that compromise transaction consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: main() - PingEndPoints branch] [Silent Failure] Does the command silently succeed even if cluster construction encounters non-fatal errors, giving operators false confidence in cluster connectivity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Struct: EmitTx] [Parameter Validation] Do the flattened cluster_args, emit_args, and emit_workload_args undergo proper validation, or can an attacker pass contradictory or malicious parameters (e.g., negative durations, invalid gas prices) that cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Struct: CreateAccounts] [Insufficient Bounds Checking] Are there minimum/maximum limits on create_accounts_args parameters, or can an attacker request zero accounts or integer-overflow account counts that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Struct: Args] [Subcommand Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft input that causes clap to allocate excessive memory during subcommand parsing, leading to OOM conditions on the emitter host? (Low)"
