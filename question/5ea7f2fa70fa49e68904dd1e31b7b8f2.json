  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Fp::weighted_sum()] [NaN/Inf Equivalents] While fields don't have NaN, can certain field element values act as 'trap values' that propagate through computations causing unexpected results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Trait: WeightedSum] [Type Parameter Constraints] Should the trait bound Scalar: PrimeField be strengthened to include additional constraints like Clear or Zeroize for security? Can weak bounds enable misuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Cofactor Handling] For curves with cofactor > 1, does MSM properly handle cofactor clearing, or can small-subgroup attacks exploit unchecked points? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Fp::weighted_sum()] [Reduction Timing] If modular reduction is conditional (only when exceeding modulus), can timing variations leak information about scalar magnitudes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Module-wide] [Exception Safety] If panic unwinding occurs during weighted_sum execution (e.g., OOM), can partial state leave the crypto system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/weighted_sum.rs] [Function: Affine::weighted_sum()] [Concurrent MSM] If multiple threads call MSM simultaneously, are there shared mutable state or race conditions in arkworks that could cause non-deterministic results? (High)"
