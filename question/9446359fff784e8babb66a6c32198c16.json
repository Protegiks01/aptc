  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Type safety] [usize to u16 cast] In iter_ones(), last_set_bit(), and From implementations, can casts from usize to u16 lose high bits, causing incorrect validator indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Type safety] [u8 to u16 cast] In FromIterator<u8>, can casting u8 (0-255) to u16 cause confusion about whether values represent bit positions or byte values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic] [Division consistency] Is 'pos / 8' using integer division guaranteed to produce the same results as 'pos >> 3' mentioned in code comments across all compilers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic] [Modulo vs subtraction] The code uses 'pos - (bucket * 8)' instead of 'pos % 8' - can this produce different results in edge cases due to integer overflow behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic] [Shift amount] Shifting by 'bucket_pos as u8' where bucket_pos can be 0-7 - can shift amounts >= 8 due to miscalculation cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic] [Multiplication overflow] In iter_ones() 'self.inner.len() * BUCKET_SIZE', can this overflow on systems where usize is 32 bits and len approaches 2^32/8? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Cryptographic] [Hash stability] Does the derived Hash trait produce cryptographically stable hashes suitable for consensus message signing, or can hash collisions be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Cryptographic] [Deterministic serialization] Is BCS serialization of BitVec deterministic across all validators, or can non-determinism cause consensus failures when signing vote messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-bitvec/src/lib.rs] [Security] [Timing attacks] Do bit operations (set, is_set) take constant time, or can timing variations leak information about validator voting patterns to network observers? (Low)"
