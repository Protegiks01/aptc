  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Field: TransactionScriptABI.code] [Bytecode version mismatch] Does the code field enforce bytecode version constraints, or can attackers inject bytecode from incompatible Move versions, causing VM crashes or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Field: TransactionScriptABI.code] [Magic number bypass] Can the code vector lack proper Move bytecode magic numbers, allowing execution of arbitrary binary data as if it were valid bytecode, potentially leading to memory corruption?
