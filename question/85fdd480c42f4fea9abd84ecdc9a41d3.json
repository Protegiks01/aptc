  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Transaction Hashing] [Transaction Malleability] Can transaction hash computation be manipulated to create different hashes for semantically identical transactions, breaking transaction deduplication in mempool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: State Root] [State Root Manipulation] Can validators compute different state roots for the same state due to hash computation non-determinism, causing consensus failures during state synchronization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Merkle Tree] [Merkle Proof Forgery] Can attackers exploit hash computation to forge Merkle proofs for non-existent state, allowing them to prove false account balances and steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: AptosDB Usage] [Database Collision] Can hash collisions in AptosDB key generation cause different state values to overwrite each other, corrupting account data and causing fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Jellyfish Merkle] [Tree Path Collision] Can attackers find state keys that hash to overlapping Merkle tree paths, causing state writes to corrupt each other and break storage integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: State Pruning] [Pruning Race] During state pruning, can hash computation race conditions cause validators to disagree on which historical states to keep, breaking state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Move Resource Hashing] [Resource Identity] Can Move resources with different types but same serialized form hash to same value, breaking resource uniqueness guarantees and enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Move Event Hashing] [Event Verification] Can event hash computation be exploited to create fake events that pass verification, allowing attackers to manipulate off-chain indexers and oracles? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: Move Module Hashing] [Module Identity] Can attackers deploy different Move modules that hash to same value, causing module loading to fetch wrong bytecode and execute malicious code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: REST API] [Hash Format Injection] Can attackers inject malformed hash strings through API endpoints that cause parsing errors or crashes in backend services processing transaction queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs] [Overall: GraphQL] [Query Injection] Can hash-based GraphQL queries be manipulated to cause database lookups with malformed hashes, enabling SQL injection or performance DoS? (Medium)",
