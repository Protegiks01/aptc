  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Hash Collision Attack] Can an attacker craft multiple different proposal payloads that produce the same execution_hash through SHA-3 collision or length extension attacks, allowing them to submit a benign proposal for voting but execute malicious code after approval? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Empty Hash Validation] Does the function validate that execution_hash is non-empty and meets minimum length requirements, or can an attacker submit a proposal with an empty Vec<u8> execution_hash to bypass execution validation and potentially execute arbitrary code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Hash Length Overflow] Can an attacker provide an execution_hash Vec<u8> with excessive length (e.g., gigabytes) to cause memory exhaustion in validators processing the proposal, leading to consensus slowdown or node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Hash Preimage Attack] If execution_hash uses a weak hashing algorithm or insufficient hash length, can an attacker find a preimage that matches a legitimate proposal's hash, allowing them to substitute malicious execution logic after governance approval? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Hash Format Injection] Can an attacker inject malformed hash data (e.g., non-UTF8 bytes, control characters) in the execution_hash parameter that causes parsing errors or unexpected behavior in the underlying Move governance module when the proposal is executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Metadata Hash Mismatch] Does the function verify that metadata_hash actually corresponds to the metadata_location content, or can an attacker provide mismatched values to deceive voters about proposal contents while executing different logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Metadata Location Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious URLs, IPFS hashes, or file paths in metadata_location (Vec<u8>) to redirect voters to phishing sites or malicious content, manipulating voting decisions through social engineering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Metadata Size Attack] Can an attacker submit proposals with extremely large metadata_location or metadata_hash vectors (multi-megabyte payloads) to cause transaction size limits to be exceeded, DoS validators, or increase storage costs maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Metadata Encoding Exploit] If metadata_location is expected to be UTF-8 encoded URLs/paths, can an attacker submit invalid UTF-8 sequences or binary data that causes parsing failures, validator crashes, or bypasses metadata validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Empty Metadata Bypass] Does the function enforce that metadata_location and metadata_hash are non-empty, or can an attacker submit proposals with zero-length metadata to avoid transparency requirements and hide proposal intentions from voters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Stake Pool Impersonation] Can an attacker specify an arbitrary stake_pool AccountAddress they don't control to create proposals on behalf of other validators, potentially manipulating governance by associating malicious proposals with reputable validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Invalid Stake Pool Address] Does the function validate that stake_pool corresponds to an active, registered validator stake pool, or can an attacker use non-existent, inactive, or system addresses to bypass stake requirements and create unauthorized proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Stake Pool Authorization Check] Is there proper verification that the transaction sender (account) has delegation rights or ownership over the specified stake_pool, or can any account create proposals claiming to represent any stake pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Zero Address Stake Pool] Can an attacker use the zero address (0x0) or other special system addresses as stake_pool to bypass minimum stake requirements or gain elevated proposal privileges reserved for system governance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Stake Pool Reentrancy] If the underlying Move function makes callback to the stake_pool account during proposal creation, can an attacker exploit reentrancy by having the stake_pool be a malicious smart contract that calls back into governance functions recursively? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Multi-Step Flag Manipulation] Can an attacker toggle the is_multi_step_proposal boolean to true to create proposals that require multiple execution steps, then exploit race conditions or state changes between steps to execute malicious logic after initial approval? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Multi-Step Execution Order] For multi-step proposals, does the governance system enforce strict execution order and atomic commits, or can an attacker manipulate execution sequence to execute steps out-of-order causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Multi-Step Partial Execution] If a multi-step proposal fails midway through execution, are all steps atomically rolled back, or can partial execution leave the chain in an inconsistent state that attackers can exploit? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Multi-Step Time Gap Exploit] Can an attacker create multi-step proposals where significant time passes between steps, allowing them to observe voting patterns, market conditions, or chain state and exploit this information when executing later steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Single-Step Bypass] Can an attacker set is_multi_step_proposal to false to bypass additional validation, review periods, or security checks that only apply to multi-step proposals, potentially fast-tracking malicious proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Gas Limit Exhaustion] Does harness.run_transaction_payload enforce appropriate gas limits, or can an attacker create proposals with computational complexity that exhausts gas limits during execution, causing proposal failures or validator resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Transaction Status Validation] Does the caller properly validate the returned TransactionStatus for success/failure, or can an attacker exploit failed proposal creations that are incorrectly treated as successful, leading to state inconsistencies?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/e2e-move-tests/src/aptos_governance.rs] [Function: create_proposal_v2()] [Account Signature Bypass] Is the account parameter's signature and authentication properly verified by the harness, or can an attacker forge account credentials to create proposals without proper authorization?
