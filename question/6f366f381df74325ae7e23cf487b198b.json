  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: TelemetryDump] [Authentication Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the `user_id` field to impersonate other validators or nodes, submitting telemetry data as different peers and polluting metrics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: TelemetryDump] [Identity Spoofing] Does the `client_id` field undergo cryptographic verification, or can malicious actors forge client identities to submit false telemetry data affecting network monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: TelemetryDump] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker submit `timestamp_micros` values far in the future or past, causing time-based logic errors, metric corruption, or bypassing rate limiting mechanisms?
