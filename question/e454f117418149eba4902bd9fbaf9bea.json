  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Race Condition] Can concurrent access to the Lazy::new() initialization cause race conditions where multiple threads simultaneously initialize the DurationHistogram, potentially leading to inconsistent metric state or panics during validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker spam the event processing loop with malicious discovery events to continuously record busy durations, causing unbounded memory growth in the histogram buckets and eventually crashing validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Information Leakage] Does the histogram expose sensitive timing information about event processing that could allow attackers to infer internal validator state, discover vulnerabilities in event handling logic, or perform timing-based side-channel attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Panic on Initialization] If the register_histogram!() macro fails and unwrap() panics during lazy initialization, can this cause validator nodes to crash at startup or during runtime when the metric is first accessed, leading to loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Observability Blind Spot] Does the duration histogram only track 'busy' time, potentially hiding malicious activity that occurs during 'idle' periods, allowing attackers to exploit discovery protocol weaknesses without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate system time or clock skew to poison the duration measurements, causing incorrect busy time calculations that hide performance degradation attacks or create false alerting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Metric Poisoning] If malicious discovery events cause extremely long processing times, can the histogram become saturated with outlier values that obscure legitimate performance issues and prevent operators from detecting consensus slowdowns? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: EVENT_PROCESSING_LOOP_BUSY_DURATION_S] [Bucket Overflow] Can an attacker cause processing loops to run for unbounded durations that exceed histogram bucket limits, causing metric overflow or wraparound that hides DoS attacks against the discovery system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Label Cardinality Attack] Can an attacker supply unbounded unique values for the 'peer_id' label by spoofing discovery messages from millions of fake peers, causing unbounded memory growth in the IntCounterVec and eventually exhausting validator node memory leading to crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Label Injection] Can malicious peers inject special characters, control characters, or excessively long strings into the 'peer_id', 'network_id', or 'role_type' labels that cause metric export failures, monitoring system crashes, or exploitation of downstream metric processing systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Race Condition] Can concurrent increments to DISCOVERY_COUNTS from multiple threads processing discovery events simultaneously cause race conditions where counter values become inconsistent, hiding actual peer discovery counts and masking network partition attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker cause the IntCounterVec values to overflow by repeatedly triggering discovery events over extended time periods, causing counter wraparound that resets metrics to zero and hides persistent network attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Information Leakage] Do the 'role_type', 'network_id', and 'peer_id' labels expose sensitive validator topology information that attackers can scrape from metrics endpoints to map the network, identify high-value targets, and plan targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Panic on Initialization] If register_int_counter_vec!() fails and unwrap() panics, can this crash validator nodes during initialization or when first accessed, causing immediate loss of liveness for validators attempting to join the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Metric Label Confusion] Can attackers manipulate the 'metric' label dimension to create arbitrary metric names that collide with other system metrics, causing monitoring confusion, false alerting, or hiding actual security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Trust Boundary Violation] Are the label values ('peer_id', 'network_id', 'role_type') derived from untrusted network input without proper validation, allowing malicious peers to inject arbitrary data into metrics that could exploit monitoring infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Memory Leak] Can the combination of four label dimensions (role_type × network_id × peer_id × metric) create an exponential number of unique time series that never get garbage collected, causing gradual memory exhaustion and eventual validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Observability Blind Spot] Does the counter only track specific discovery event types via the 'metric' label, potentially missing adversarial discovery behaviors that don't trigger counter increments, allowing stealthy network reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Label Validation] Are there any constraints on the maximum length or character set for label values, or can attackers inject megabyte-sized strings into 'peer_id' labels that consume excessive memory per time series? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Counter Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators intentionally avoid incrementing discovery counters for certain peers to hide their network connections, enabling collusion or preventing detection of validator set manipulation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Prometheus Exposition] When metrics are exposed via Prometheus endpoints, can unauthenticated attackers scrape DISCOVERY_COUNTS to enumerate all validator peer IDs, network topologies, and role types to aid in targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: DISCOVERY_COUNTS] [Label Sanitization] Are peer_id values sanitized before being used as labels, or can they contain Prometheus label syntax characters that break metric parsing and cause monitoring system failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Security Alert Suppression] Can an attacker continuously trigger network key mismatch gauges to flood monitoring systems with alerts, causing alert fatigue that masks legitimate key compromise incidents or validator impersonation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/discovery/src/counters.rs] [Metric: NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH] [Information Disclosure] Does the NETWORK_KEY_MISMATCH gauge expose which specific validators have key mismatches, allowing attackers to identify misconfigured or compromised validators to target for further exploitation?
