  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Type Safety] Does the trait bound requiring ScriptCache with Key = [u8; 32] ensure collision resistance, or could SHA3-256 hash collisions allow an attacker to replace cached scripts with malicious bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [State Consistency] Can the combination of ModuleStorage and ScriptCache in the CodeStorage trait lead to inconsistent state where modules and scripts reference different versions of dependencies, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Cache Poisoning] Does the trait enforce any guarantees about cache invalidation when underlying modules change, or can stale cached scripts execute with outdated module dependencies leading to incorrect state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Type Safety] Can implementors violate the trait contract by providing inconsistent Deserialized (CompiledScript) and Verified (Script) types, potentially bypassing verification checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Blanket Implementation] [Trait Bound] Does the blanket impl ensure that all types implementing both ModuleStorage and ScriptCache maintain atomic consistency between module and script caches during concurrent access? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Verification Bypass] Can an implementation insert unverified scripts into the cache by exploiting the lack of explicit verification requirements in the trait definition? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Key Collision] Is the 32-byte key space for scripts sufficient to prevent birthday attacks where an attacker generates colliding script hashes to replace legitimate scripts? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the trait impose any bounds on cache size, or can an attacker flood the script cache with unique scripts causing memory exhaustion on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Concurrent Access] Does the trait guarantee thread-safety for implementations, or can race conditions between module loading and script caching cause non-deterministic execution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Dependency Management] Can the separation of ModuleStorage and ScriptCache allow scripts to be cached without verifying their module dependencies are available and verified? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Blanket Implementation] [Type Constraint] Does the implicit trait bound coupling prevent implementing CodeStorage for custom storage backends that need different script caching strategies? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Gas Metering] Does the trait ensure that implementations properly meter gas for both module and script operations, or can attackers exploit unmetered cache operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Determinism] Can different CodeStorage implementations produce non-deterministic results when the same script hash maps to different bytecode due to cache inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Error Handling] Does the trait specify how errors from ModuleStorage should propagate through ScriptCache operations, or can error swallowing lead to silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Access Control] Does the trait enforce any access control on who can insert scripts into the cache, or can any transaction populate the cache with arbitrary scripts? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Serialization] Can the requirement for CompiledScript as Deserialized type be exploited by malformed bytecode that deserializes successfully but fails verification in subtle ways? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Version Consistency] Does the trait ensure that modules and scripts are loaded with consistent version tracking, or can version mismatches cause execution with incompatible code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Blanket Implementation] [Orphan Rules] Could the blanket implementation create conflicts with specialized implementations needed for parallel execution environments? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Cache Coherence] In multi-validator scenarios, can cache inconsistencies between nodes cause different validators to execute the same transaction with different script versions? (Critical)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Integrity] Does the trait require implementations to maintain integrity between the script bytecode and its hash key, or can implementations insert mismatched data? (High)",
