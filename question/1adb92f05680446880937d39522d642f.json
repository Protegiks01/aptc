  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: state_change_hash] [State Commitment Mismatch] Can an attacker deserialize transactions with incorrect state_change_hash values that don't match the actual state changes, causing BigQuery data to diverge from the canonical blockchain state and breaking state verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: event_root_hash] [Event Root Tampering] Can manipulated event_root_hash values in deserialized transactions cause mismatches between BigQuery event data and on-chain event logs, making it impossible to verify event integrity through BigQuery analytics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: state_checkpoint_hash] [Optional Field Exploitation] The state_checkpoint_hash is optional - can an attacker selectively omit this field for specific transactions to hide state checkpoint information and make it harder to verify state consistency at checkpoint boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: gas_used] [Gas Accounting Bypass] Can extremely large gas_used values (near u64::MAX) be deserialized and written to BigQuery, allowing an attacker to create fake transaction records that show impossible gas consumption and corrupt gas usage analytics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: accumulator_root_hash] [Accumulator Integrity] Can incorrect accumulator_root_hash values break the cryptographic accumulator chain when reconstructed from BigQuery data, preventing verification of transaction inclusion proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Field: epoch] [Epoch Boundary Manipulation] Can an attacker deserialize transactions with incorrect epoch values that place them in the wrong epoch boundaries, corrupting epoch-based analytics and validator set change tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Integration] [Serialization Source Trust] When Transaction objects are serialized from the blockchain indexer, are they validated before serialization, or can corrupted in-memory transaction objects pass through serialization and corrupt BigQuery data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Integration] [Deserialization Authority] When deserializing transactions from external sources (backups, replicas), is there access control to ensure only trusted sources can populate BigQuery, or can unauthorized parties inject fake transaction records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Integration] [Data Consistency] If the same transaction is serialized and deserialized multiple times with slight variations in optional fields, can this create duplicate or conflicting records in BigQuery that break transaction uniqueness constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Integration] [Schema Evolution] If the protobuf schema is updated to add new required fields, will old serialized data fail to deserialize, causing data loss or service disruption when processing historical BigQuery exports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Error Handling] [Partial Deserialization] If deserialization fails partway through processing a map (e.g., after processing version but before hash), are partially constructed Transaction objects properly cleaned up, or can they leak memory or cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Message Information Leakage] Do the duplicate_field and missing_field error messages leak sensitive information about internal data structures or expected field formats that could aid attackers in crafting exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty String Fields] Can required string fields (hash, type, state_change_hash) be deserialized as empty strings, bypassing validation and creating invalid transaction records with missing critical identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode and Special Characters] Are string fields (hash, payload, vm_status) validated for correct encoding, or can an attacker inject invalid UTF-8, null bytes, or control characters that corrupt BigQuery string columns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Values] For integer fields like gas_used, num_events, and num_write_set_changes, are zero values semantically valid, or can they indicate error conditions that should be rejected during deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [Edge Case] [MaxValue Exploitation] Can i64::MAX or u64::MAX values in version, block_height, epoch, or gas_used fields cause arithmetic overflow in BigQuery aggregate queries (SUM, AVG) that produce incorrect analytics results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [General] [Deterministic Serialization] Does the serialize() method produce deterministic output for the same Transaction object, or can non-deterministic field ordering cause duplicate BigQuery records that waste storage and confuse deduplication logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [General] [Backward Compatibility] If this serde implementation is updated to handle new Transaction fields, will it remain compatible with existing BigQuery tables, or can schema mismatches cause deserialization failures and data loss? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [General] [Performance DoS] Can an attacker provide deeply nested JSON objects or extremely long field values that cause the deserializer to consume excessive CPU time, enabling DoS attacks on BigQuery streaming infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.serde.rs] [General] [Code Generation Trust] Since this is auto-generated code, are the code generation tools (prost-build, pbjson) themselves secure and free from vulnerabilities that could inject malicious code into the serde implementations? (Low)"
