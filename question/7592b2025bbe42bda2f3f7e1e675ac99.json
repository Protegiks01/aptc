  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Error handling vulnerability] When to_bytes_by_protocol() returns an error (anyhow::Result), is the error properly propagated to prevent partially serialized messages from being sent, or can error handling bugs cause corrupt message transmission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Peer list manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious peers Vec containing duplicate or invalid PeerIds to to_bytes_by_protocol(), causing resource exhaustion through redundant serialization operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [HashMap ordering attack] Does the HashMap<PeerId, Bytes> returned by to_bytes_by_protocol() preserve any ordering guarantees, or can non-deterministic HashMap ordering lead to inconsistent broadcast behavior across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol negotiation race] If validators have different protocol capabilities, can race conditions in to_bytes_by_protocol() cause some peers to receive messages in unsupported protocols, leading to silent message drops?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [TODO comment vulnerability] The TODO comment indicates this function shouldn't be exposed - could the current exposure of peer/network ID mapping allow external code to bypass intended network isolation or access control? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: get_peer_network_id_for_peer()] [Epoch boundary confusion] During epoch transitions, does get_peer_network_id_for_peer() correctly handle peer IDs that may be valid in one epoch but not another, or can this cause messages to be routed to nodes that are no longer authorized validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency manipulation] Can Byzantine validators artificially manipulate network latency measurements to influence sort_peers_by_latency(), causing them to be prioritized in peer selection and enabling selective message filtering attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-jwk-consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Priority bias attack] If sort_peers_by_latency() is used to select which peers to contact first for JWK observations, can malicious validators exploit latency ranking to ensure colluding Byzantine validators are always contacted first, biasing consensus toward malicious observations?
