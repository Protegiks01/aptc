  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory leakage] Does the InputSecret struct lack a Drop implementation to securely zeroize the scalar field 'a' from memory when the secret is no longer needed, potentially leaving sensitive cryptographic material in memory accessible to attackers through memory dumps, swap files, or process memory inspection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory disclosure] Can an attacker with read access to validator process memory extract the unzeroized scalar value 'a' after the InputSecret is dropped, compromising the PVSS dealing secret and allowing reconstruction of distributed keys or manipulation of DKG outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory persistence] When an InputSecret is moved or reassigned, does the original memory location retain the scalar value without being overwritten, creating multiple copies of the secret in memory that could be extracted by an attacker performing memory forensics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Swap file leakage] If the validator node's memory is swapped to disk under memory pressure, can the InputSecret scalar 'a' be written to swap files in plaintext, allowing an attacker with disk access to recover PVSS secrets even after the process terminates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Core dump exposure] When a validator process crashes and generates a core dump, is the InputSecret scalar 'a' included in the dump file without sanitization, allowing attackers to extract cryptographic secrets from crash reports or debugging artifacts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Stack vs heap allocation] Is the InputSecret allocated on the stack where it might be subject to stack inspection attacks, or on the heap where it could be more vulnerable to heap spray attacks or use-after-free exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Memory alignment] Could memory alignment padding in the InputSecret struct cause the scalar 'a' to be copied to unintended memory locations during struct operations, creating additional copies that won't be cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [LLVM optimization] Can LLVM compiler optimizations duplicate or cache the scalar value 'a' in registers or temporary variables that aren't tracked by Rust's ownership system, leaving secret material in CPU caches or register files?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Panic unwinding] When a panic occurs during PVSS dealing and the stack is unwound, does the InputSecret get properly cleaned from the stack, or could stack inspection during unwinding expose the secret scalar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Timing side-channel] Does the is_zero() method call is_zero_vartime() which is explicitly variable-time, allowing an attacker to determine if an InputSecret is zero through timing analysis, potentially revealing information about PVSS dealing parameters or enabling targeted attacks on zero secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Zero detection attack] Can a malicious validator use timing measurements of is_zero() calls to distinguish between zero and non-zero input secrets during PVSS dealing, allowing them to bias the DKG protocol or predict secret shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Remote timing attack] In a distributed PVSS protocol across multiple validators, can network timing measurements reveal whether a remote validator's InputSecret is zero through observable differences in processing time when is_zero_vartime() is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add()] [Addition timing leak] Do the Add and AddAssign implementations for InputSecret have variable execution time based on the scalar values being added, leaking information about secret magnitudes through timing side-channels? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add()] [Carry propagation timing] During scalar field addition in the add() methods, does carry propagation timing vary based on input values, allowing attackers to perform differential timing analysis to extract bits of the secret scalar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: get_secret_a()] [Access pattern leak] Can repeated calls to get_secret_a() in performance-critical PVSS dealing code create observable cache access patterns that leak information about the secret through cache-timing attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Zero] [zero() construction timing] Does the Zero::zero() method have constant-time execution, or could timing variations during zero scalar construction leak information in comparison operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Branch prediction attack] Does the is_zero_vartime() call introduce data-dependent branches that can be exploited through speculative execution attacks (Spectre-style) to leak whether secrets are zero across security boundaries?
