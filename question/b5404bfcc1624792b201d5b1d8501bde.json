  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext] [BTreeMap Memory Growth] Can an attacker craft module dependency graphs that cause the visited BTreeMap to grow to massive sizes, consuming validator memory and slowing down traversal operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Boolean Logic Inversion] Can an attacker exploit the negation operator in '!addr.is_special()' if is_special() has non-standard boolean semantics or side effects that make the logic invertible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Insert Return Value Confusion] Since insert() returns Option<()>, can the is_none() check be confused or exploited if the type system is violated through unsafe code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [Error Construction Exploit] Can an attacker cause PartialVMError::new() to fail or panic, bypassing the error return and causing unexpected program flow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext] [Empty Tuple Invariant] Does storing () as the map value serve a purpose, or is it vestigial code that could be exploited if future changes add data to the value type without updating all callsites? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Special Address Definition Change] If the is_special() implementation changes to include more addresses (e.g., 0x0-0x1f), will existing visited tracking break, causing modules to be revisited or gas charges to be inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_is_special_or_visited()] [Special Address Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker exploit governance or upgrade mechanisms to change which addresses are considered special, retroactively affecting visited tracking and gas accounting?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: legacy_check_visited()] [Backwards Compatibility Attack] Can attackers exploit native functions that use legacy_check_visited() to bypass the is_special() check, accessing system modules without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [IdentStr Lifetime] Since IdentStr is a borrowed type, can an attacker cause the underlying string data to be deallocated while references exist in the visited map? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [IdentStr Comparison Attack] Can an attacker craft module names that are semantically different but compare equal in BTreeMap ordering, causing wrong modules to be considered visited?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [Module Name Injection] Can an attacker inject format string specifiers or escape sequences into module names that cause the error message construction to fail or leak information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Test: test_traversal_context()] [Test Insufficient Coverage] Does the test properly cover race conditions, concurrent access, or edge cases like address boundaries (0xf vs 0x10), or can attackers exploit untested code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Test: test_traversal_context()] [Special Address Test Gap] The test only checks 0x1 as special - can attackers exploit other special addresses (0x0, 0x2-0xf) that may have different behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Test: test_traversal_context()] [Arena Allocation Testing] Does the test verify that arena allocations are properly tracked and don't leak memory, or can attackers exploit arena behavior not covered in tests? (Low)",
