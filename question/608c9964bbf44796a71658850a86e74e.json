  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Function: new()] [No input sanitization] The new() constructor accepts raw TokenId and amount without any sanitization - can attackers pass in malformed or malicious data structures that bypass later validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Field: id] [String length limits] Are there maximum length limits enforced on TokenDataId.collection and TokenDataId.name strings, or can attackers create events with gigabyte-sized strings to exhaust memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Field: amount] [Semantic validation] Does amount=u64::MAX have any special semantic meaning (e.g., 'withdraw all'), or is it treated as a literal value that could overflow in arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Indexer crashes] If the indexer processes events in parallel and try_from_bytes() fails for some events but not others, can this cause indexer state corruption or missed events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdrawEvent] [SQL injection in indexer] When TokenId.collection or TokenId.name are used in SQL queries by the indexer, are they properly escaped, or can specially crafted strings lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Function: id()] [Race condition in indexer] If the indexer calls id() and amount() separately and the event is being modified concurrently (in an unsafe context), could this lead to inconsistent data being indexed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [VM type validation] When the Move VM emits a TokenWithdrawEvent, does it validate that the event structure matches the expected schema, or can bytecode manipulation inject events with corrupted structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Impl: MoveEventV1Type] [Gas metering] Is emitting a TokenWithdrawEvent properly gas-metered based on the size of the TokenId strings, or can attackers emit huge events for fixed gas cost to DoS the event system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdrawEvent] [Field addition] If future versions add new fields to TokenWithdrawEvent, will old clients be able to deserialize new events, or will this break backwards compatibility and cause network partitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Version negotiation] Does BCS deserialization support version negotiation, or will any schema changes to TokenWithdrawEvent cause immediate deserialization failures across the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Fuzzing coverage] Has try_from_bytes() been thoroughly fuzz-tested with malformed BCS inputs, or could there be undiscovered crash bugs that attackers can trigger with crafted event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_withdraw_event.rs] [Struct: TokenWithdrawEvent] [Property testing] Are there property-based tests ensuring that serialization-deserialization round-trips are always identity operations, or could subtle bugs cause data corruption? (Low)"
