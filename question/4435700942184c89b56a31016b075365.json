  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Clone in Multithreaded Context] Since OutputArgs is Clone, can multiple threads clone and use the same output_path concurrently, leading to race conditions in write()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [&self Method] The write() method takes &self - is this safe for concurrent access, or should it take &mut self to prevent simultaneous writes to the same file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [File Locking] Does write() use any file locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent writes from different processes corrupting the output file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [fs::write Atomicity] std::fs::write() may not be atomic - can interrupted writes leave partial or corrupted files that break node-checker spec consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [fs::write Truncation] Does std::fs::write() truncate existing files before writing, or append? Can this lead to data loss if the new content is shorter than existing content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [fs::write Error Codes] Are specific std::io::Error variants from std::fs::write() handled differently, or does generic error propagation miss critical failure modes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Dependencies] [Clap Vulnerabilities] Does the clap parser (used for #[derive(Parser)]) have known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited through malicious command-line arguments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Dependencies] [std::fs Security] Are there known vulnerabilities in Rust's std::fs module that affect write() operations on specific platforms or kernel versions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Production Hardening] In production deployments, should output_path be restricted to specific directories through runtime checks not present in the code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Default Behavior] When output_path is None (default), output goes to stdout - is this safe in production where stdout might be logged or monitored, potentially leaking sensitive node-checker data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Audit Logging] Does write() log file operations for audit purposes, or can attackers write to arbitrary paths without leaving audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Context: generate_openapi] [OpenAPI Injection] When used by generate_openapi.rs, can malicious OpenAPI spec content in the output parameter exploit parsers or API consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Context: generate_openapi] [Spec Poisoning] Can an attacker cause write() to overwrite legitimate node-checker OpenAPI specs with malicious ones, causing validator nodes to accept invalid health check configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Context: generate_openapi] [Format Downgrade] Can forcing OutputFormat::Json when YAML is expected (or vice versa) cause API consumers to misparse specs, leading to incorrect validator health assessments? (Medium)"
