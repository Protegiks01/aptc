  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyVersionNotFound] [Downgrade Attack] Can KeyVersionNotFound during signature verification cause fallback to accepting signatures from any key version, enabling attackers to use compromised old keys to sign new consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::EntropyError String Parameter] [Log Injection] Can attackers control the entropy error message string through environment manipulation to inject malicious log entries that corrupt audit trails or inject commands into log processing systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::InternalError String Parameter] [Format String Vulnerability] Are InternalError message strings properly sanitized before logging or display, or can format string specifiers in error messages cause information leakage or crashes in logging systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyAlreadyExists String Parameter] [Key Name Injection] Can malicious key names containing special characters or escape sequences cause KeyAlreadyExists error messages to break parsers or inject commands in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyNotSet String Parameter] [Path Traversal] Can key name strings in KeyNotSet errors contain path traversal sequences that leak information about filesystem structure or cause directory traversal when error messages are processed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::SerializationError String Parameter] [XSS in Error Pages] If serialization error messages are displayed in web UIs or APIs, can attackers inject JavaScript or HTML through crafted binary data that triggers SerializationError with unsanitized payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyVersionNotFound String Parameters] [Multi-Parameter Injection] Can attackers exploit the two-parameter nature of KeyVersionNotFound to inject coordinated attack payloads split across key name and version fields that reconstitute during error processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Propagation] [Transaction Signing Failure] When signing transactions fails with any Error variant, does the validator properly halt and refuse to participate in consensus, or can error handling allow unsigned or incorrectly signed votes to propagate? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Propagation] [Block Proposal Failure] Can errors during block proposal signing be silently caught and ignored, allowing validators to propose blocks without valid signatures that get accepted by Byzantine validators to break safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Propagation] [Epoch Transition Failure] During epoch transitions requiring new validator key rotation, can error handling allow partial key rotations where some validators succeed and others fail, causing permanent network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Enum Matching] [Exhaustive Matching] Do all consumers of the Error enum use exhaustive pattern matching, or can new error variants added in the future cause unhandled error cases that panic or have undefined behavior in critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Enum Matching] [Default Error Handling] Can catch-all error handlers incorrectly treat security-critical errors like PermissionDenied the same as benign errors like SerializationError, allowing privilege escalation through error misclassification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error> Conversion] [Vault Token Leakage] Can vault client authentication errors leak token information through the error conversion to InternalError that gets logged or transmitted over networks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error> Conversion] [Vault Policy Bypass] Does the error conversion properly handle vault policy violations, or can certain vault errors get misclassified allowing operations that should be denied by vault policies to appear successful? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error> Pattern Matching] [HTTP Status Code Confusion] Can attackers manipulate vault server responses to return status codes that don't match NotFound or 403 patterns but still represent security failures, causing them to be logged as generic InternalErrors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Serialize Derive] [Error Broadcast Attack] When errors are serialized and sent over the network between validators, can attackers inject malicious error messages that cause receiving validators to enter incorrect error states or leak sensitive information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Serialize Derive] [Error Amplification] Can a single error be crafted to serialize into an extremely large payload that causes network congestion or memory exhaustion when broadcast to all validators during key operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyVersionNotFound Version Parameter] [Version Overflow] If the version string represents a numeric version counter, can integer overflow in version parsing cause KeyVersionNotFound to be triggered incorrectly or allow version wraparound attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [PartialEq Implementation] [Error Deduplication] Can the PartialEq implementation cause security-relevant errors to be deduplicated incorrectly, hiding repeated attack attempts or masking error patterns in security monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Eq Implementation] [Hash Collision] If errors are used as hash map keys for caching or deduplication, can attackers craft different errors that compare equal through PartialEq but represent different security conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Display via thiserror] [Sensitive Data in Display] Do the Display implementations from thiserror macro properly sanitize sensitive data before formatting error messages for logging or API responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Debug Trait] [Debug Information Leakage] Does the derived Debug trait expose more information than Display, and can attackers trigger debug logging in production to leak key names, versions, or internal paths? (Medium)",
