  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/get_path()] [Relative path exploitation] Lines 93-96 construct paths by joining with binary_name - can relative paths in binary_name escape the installation directory? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/build_updater()] [HOME/USERPROFILE injection] Line 54 calls get_additional_binaries_dir() which uses HOME/USERPROFILE environment variables - can attackers manipulate these to redirect installations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/get_path()] [Cross-platform path issues] Line 93 calls get_additional_binaries_dir() which returns platform-specific paths - can path separator differences cause vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/build_updater()] [Build-time tampering] Line 41 uses cli_build_information() which is embedded at compile time - can attackers tamper with build artifacts to inject malicious build info? (High)",
