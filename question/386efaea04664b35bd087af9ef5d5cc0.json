  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Structs] [Clone Safety] All structs derive Clone - can cloning large Resource.data fields or deeply nested EventHandle structures cause performance degradation or memory exhaustion when REST clients process multiple responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Structs] [PartialEq Bypass] Do the PartialEq implementations correctly compare all fields including nested structures, or can attackers exploit comparison edge cases to create duplicate-appearing but distinct objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource Struct] [Move Type Mismatch] Can an attacker provide a Resource with resource_type='0x1::coin::Coin<AptosCoin>' but data containing fields from a different type, causing type confusion when the resource is used in Move transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account Struct] [Transaction Construction] When the REST client uses Account data to construct transactions, can an attacker manipulate sequence_number through API response tampering to cause all subsequent transactions to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandle Struct] [Event Querying] Can manipulated EventHandle counter values cause REST clients to query invalid event indices, potentially missing critical events like fund transfers or governance votes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Types] [API Response Injection] If the REST API is compromised or returns malicious data, do these type definitions provide sufficient validation to prevent attacks, or do they blindly trust API responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [All Types] [Schema Evolution] If the on-chain schema changes (e.g., new fields added to Account), can old clients using these type definitions misinterpret state or fail to deserialize responses, causing transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account.authentication_key] [Key Length Validation] Does AuthenticationKey enforce the correct 32-byte length after deserialization, or can attackers provide keys of arbitrary length that break signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account.authentication_key] [Key Derivation] Can an attacker manipulate the hex representation of authentication_key to create keys that collide with system accounts or validators, enabling privilege escalation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [ID.addr] [Address Validation] Does the Address type from aptos_api_types perform proper validation of account addresses, or can attackers use invalid addresses that cause state lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [ID.addr] [System Address Bypass] Can an attacker set addr to system addresses like 0x1 (framework address) in an ID struct to create GUIDs that appear to originate from trusted system modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account.sequence_number] [Wraparound Attack] If an account's sequence number reaches u64::MAX-1 and an attacker causes it to wrap to 0, can this break transaction ordering and enable double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandle.counter] [Counter Inconsistency] Can the counter value become inconsistent with actual emitted events if deserialization accepts arbitrary U64 values without validation against on-chain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [ID.creation_num] [Monotonicity Violation] Does creation_num enforce monotonic increase per address, or can attackers provide out-of-order creation numbers that break GUID uniqueness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandleGUID.len_bytes] [Bounds Checking] Is len_bytes validated against actual guid size before use, or can buffer overruns occur if len_bytes exceeds actual data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Account Struct] [TOCTOU Attack] Between deserializing Account and using its sequence_number for transaction construction, can an attacker submit intervening transactions that invalidate the sequence number, causing transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource Struct] [Concurrent Deserialization] If multiple threads deserialize Resource structs with the same resource_type but different data, can race conditions cause data corruption or incorrect resource merging? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [EventHandle Struct] [Counter Race] Can concurrent updates to EventHandle counter values cause event ordering issues if multiple threads process events simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_resource_type] [String Encoding] Does parse_struct_tag properly handle UTF-8 encoding, or can attackers use non-ASCII characters to bypass type name validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Case Sensitivity] Are hex strings case-insensitive during parsing, and can case variations cause duplicate entries in caches or deduplication systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_resource_type] [Special Characters] Can StructTag strings contain special characters (like null bytes, control characters) that exploit parser vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [deserialize_from_prefixed_hex_string] [Homoglyph Attack] Can attackers use visually similar Unicode characters in hex strings to create authentication keys that appear identical but have different cryptographic properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/types.rs] [Resource.data] [JSON Depth Limit] Does serde_json::Value impose limits on nesting depth, or can attackers craft deeply nested JSON objects in Resource.data that cause stack overflow? (Medium)",
