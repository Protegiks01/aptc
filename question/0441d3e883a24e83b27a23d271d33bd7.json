  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Component leak] If start() fails partway through (e.g., peer manager starts but connectivity manager fails), are partially started components properly cleaned up, or do they leak resources and continue operating in degraded state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Seeds memory DoS] Can extremely large seed sets passed to add_connectivity_manager() cause memory exhaustion, especially when combined with discovery methods that add more peers dynamically? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [Discovery update flood] Can an attacker control discovery interval_secs to flood the system with discovery updates, causing CPU exhaustion from constant peer set recalculation and connection churn? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Max frame size zero] Can max_frame_size be set to zero causing division by zero errors in frame chunking logic, or values near usize::MAX causing integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Max message size inconsistency] If max_message_size > max_frame_size, can this create protocol inconsistencies where messages are fragmented in unexpected ways, potentially bypassing size validation or causing reassembly failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Config immutability bypass] After NetworkBuilder is created from config, can subsequent modifications to the NetworkConfig affect the already-built network, causing configuration drift and security policy violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: network_context()] [Context cloning attack] Can repeated calls to network_context() be used to obtain multiple NetworkContext instances, and if so, can modifications to one context affect others through shared state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: conn_mgr_reqs_tx()] [Channel interception] Can an attacker obtaining a clone of conn_mgr_reqs_tx sender inject malicious connectivity requests, bypassing discovery and directly controlling which peers the validator connects to? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: listen_address()] [Address information leak] Can exposing listen_address() to untrusted callers leak sensitive network topology information, enabling reconnaissance for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Time service manipulation] Can an attacker provide a malicious TimeService that returns incorrect timestamps, breaking timeout-based security mechanisms in health checks, connection backoff, or discovery intervals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Mutual auth downgrade in fullnodes] For fullnode networks where mutual_authentication might be false, can this be exploited to inject malicious fullnodes that propagate incorrect state, invalid transactions, or manipulated peer discoveries to validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: merge_seeds()] [Peer.extend() failure handling] When seed.extend(peer.clone()).unwrap() fails, does the panic occur before or after partial state modification, potentially leaving seeds in corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [Reconfig subscription DoS] Can an attacker trigger excessive reconfiguration events through onchain governance to flood the validator_set discovery listener with updates, causing connection churn and consensus disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [File path traversal] For DiscoveryMethod::File, is file_discovery.path properly validated against path traversal attacks, or can an attacker use ../../../etc/passwd style paths to read arbitrary files or cause filesystem DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: setup_discovery()] [REST URL injection] For DiscoveryMethod::Rest, can rest_discovery.url contain malicious URLs (file://, javascript:, data:) that exploit the REST client implementation to execute code or leak data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Discovery listener double-start] The code initializes discovery_listeners = Some(Vec::new()) but what if create() is called multiple times on the same instance - can this leak discovery listeners or cause duplicate subscriptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [HashSet uniqueness bypass] The duplicate discovery source check uses HashSet - can an attacker provide discovery sources that hash to the same value but have different behavior, bypassing the uniqueness assertion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: new_for_test()] [Test constant exploitation] The hardcoded MAX_FULLNODE_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS, MAX_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS values - if these differ from production defaults, can this create test vs production behavior inconsistencies exploitable in staged attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: add_connectivity_manager()] [Network type confusion] The check network_id().is_validator_network() determines connection limits - can an attacker manipulate network_id to falsely identify as validator network, gaining unlimited outbound connections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Missing network builder cleanup] If create() returns but the NetworkBuilder is never built or started, are there resource leaks from subscribed reconfig_events or initialized (but not started) builders? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [PeersAndMetadata sharing] [Metadata poisoning] Since Arc<PeersAndMetadata> is shared across multiple components (peer manager, connectivity manager, health checker), can one component's metadata corruption propagate to others, causing cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: build()] [Executor lifetime] After build() assigns executor, can the Handle become invalid (runtime dropped), causing subsequent start() to spawn tasks on a dead runtime leading to panics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/builder/src/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Partial start failure] If peer_manager starts successfully but conn_mgr or health_checker fail to start, is the peer manager properly shut down, or does it continue accepting connections without connectivity management?
