  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: ErrorWrapper] [Error Injection] Could malicious actors control error message content to inject malicious terminal escape sequences or formatting codes that compromise user terminals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Enum: RosettaCliArgs] [Command Confusion] Can ambiguous command parsing cause users to accidentally execute destructive operations (construction/transaction signing) when they intended read-only queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Clap Parser] [Argument Injection] Does the clap parser properly sanitize all command-line arguments to prevent shell injection if any arguments are passed to system commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Clap Parser] [Buffer Overflow] Can extremely long command-line arguments cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion in the clap parsing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Module Structure] [Dependency Vulnerabilities] Do the imported modules (account, block, construction, network) properly validate inputs before making Rosetta API calls, or could they introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Type: NetworkIdentifier] [Type Confusion] Does the conversion from ChainId to NetworkIdentifier preserve all security-relevant information, or could type conversions lose important validation data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Type: PartialBlockIdentifier] [Ambiguous Identifiers] When both index and hash are provided in PartialBlockIdentifier, which takes precedence, and could this lead to serving incorrect block data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Import: aptos_types::chain_id] [ChainId Integrity] Does ChainId maintain proper invariants when parsed from CLI arguments, or could malformed inputs create invalid ChainId instances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async Cancellation] If a user cancels a CLI command (Ctrl+C), does execute() properly clean up resources and close Rosetta API connections, or could it leave dangling connections? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Test: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage] Does the verify_tool() test validate security properties like input sanitization and error handling, or only structural CLI correctness? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: client()] [Connection Pooling] Does RosettaClient::new() create a new connection for each CLI invocation, potentially exhausting server connection limits with rapid repeated calls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: client()] [Timeout Configuration] Does the RosettaClient have reasonable timeouts configured, or could slow/malicious servers cause the CLI to hang indefinitely? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [Option Handling] When both block_index and block_hash are None, returning None for PartialBlockIdentifier - does the Rosetta API handle None correctly as 'latest block' or could it cause errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Function: network_identifier()] [Into Conversion] Does the Into<NetworkIdentifier> conversion for ChainId properly handle all possible ChainId values including custom/unknown chains? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Default Values] [Secure Defaults] Are the default values (localhost URL, test ChainId) safe for production use, or should the CLI refuse to run without explicit configuration to prevent accidents? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/common.rs] [Struct: BlockArgs] [keep_all_transactions Flag] Does setting keep_all_transactions to Some(true) properly communicate to the Rosetta API, or could the Option wrapper cause the flag to be ignored? (Low)",
