  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ProfilerInstruction] [Invalid instruction names] Can malformed bytecode produce Instruction values with invalid or excessively long names that cause profiler failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/probe.rs] [Struct: ProbeFnGuard] [Maximum timing duration] What happens if a function runs for longer than u64::MAX nanoseconds (>584 years) - can the truncation cause timing wrap-around that breaks monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/probe.rs] [Struct: ProbeInstrGuard] [Zero-duration instructions] Can instructions that complete in less than Instant resolution (typically 1ns) cause timing artifacts or division-by-zero errors in downstream analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/probe.rs] [Function: drop()] [Drop during panic] If a guard drops during stack unwinding from a panic, can this cause USDT probe operations to fail or interfere with panic propagation, hiding critical errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/lib.rs] [Static: VM_PROFILER] [Validator configuration divergence] If different validators configure profiling differently (enabled vs disabled), could this create subtle execution differences that eventually cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/probe.rs] [Module: vm_profiler] [Monitoring system dependency] Do validators rely on USDT probe data for critical monitoring/alerting, and could probe failures blind operators to ongoing attacks or consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/profiler/src/probe.rs] [Struct: ProbeProfiler] [Validator performance impact] Can the overhead of USDT probe emission cause validator performance degradation that affects block proposal timing or consensus participation? (High)",
