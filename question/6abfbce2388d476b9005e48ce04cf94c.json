  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Leading zeros] [Canonical Form] Are strings with leading zeros (e.g., '0123') handled correctly, or could they be parsed differently than intended? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: AltFr to ark_bn254::Fr] [Bidirectional Safety] When constants are used, they may be converted between AltFr and ark_bn254::Fr - are these conversions bijective, or could round-trip conversion lose precision? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Negative values] [Sign Handling] Could negative strings (though none appear present) bypass validation and cause unexpected behavior in field arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Trait: from_str_vartime] [Timing Attacks] The from_str_vartime call used in From<&str> is variable-time - could timing variations leak information about constant values during initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Hexadecimal] [Format Detection] Are there any hexadecimal strings mixed with decimal that could be misparsed as decimal, producing wrong field elements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: String slice] [Lifetime Safety] Are string slices properly lifetime-managed during conversion to AltFr, or could dangling references cause undefined behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: into()] [Error Context] When .into() panics on invalid strings, is the error message sufficient to identify which constant failed, or would debugging be difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Duplicate strings] [Deduplication] If identical constant strings appear multiple times, could string interning or deduplication cause unexpected aliasing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Base representation] [Radix Handling] Is the radix (base-10) explicitly specified in parsing, or could locale settings affect how numbers are interpreted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Scientific notation] [Format Support] Could strings in scientific notation (e.g., '1.2e20') be present and cause parsing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Lossy conversion] [Precision Guarantee] When converting from string to field element to bytes and back, is bit-exact precision guaranteed, or could subtle precision loss occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Empty strings] [Validation] Are empty strings filtered out before conversion, or could an empty string be parsed as zero field element when that's not intended? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Endianness] [Byte Order] When field elements are serialized/deserialized (e.g., in ark conversion), is endianness consistently handled across platforms? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Field Extension] [Compatibility] Since BN254 is a pairing-friendly curve, could confusion between base field and scalar field elements cause wrong constant usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Max value] [Boundary Testing] Are boundary values like (modulus - 1) tested to ensure they're correctly reduced and don't cause overflow in subsequent arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Repr type] [Size Assumptions] The conversion assumes 32-byte representation - is this size enforced, or could different platforms use different sizes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Data: Copy semantics] [Clone vs Copy] Are field elements Copy or Clone, and could incorrect semantics lead to moved values being reused? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/poseidon_bn254/constants.rs] [Conversion: Error propagation] [Panic vs Result] Should string-to-field conversion return Result instead of panicking, allowing graceful degradation rather than validator crash? (Medium)",
