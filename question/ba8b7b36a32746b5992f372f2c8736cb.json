  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [GlobalEnv State] [Language Version Confusion] Line 126 sets language version on the environment - can this be changed mid-compilation to cause different modules to be compiled under different language semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [ModelBuilderOptions Extension] [Options Override Attack] Line 127 sets extension options - can an attacker override security-critical options by providing malicious ModelBuilderOptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [BTreeMap/BTreeSet Usage] [Non-Deterministic Iteration] Multiple functions use BTreeMap/BTreeSet which provide deterministic ordering - but can hash collisions or custom comparators cause non-deterministic behavior across different validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Error Handling: Lines 149-164] [Parser Error State] When parser errors occur, empty aliases are added and all sources marked as targets - can this incorrect state propagate and cause later compilation stages to fail unsafely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Error Handling: Lines 242-258] [Expansion Error Recovery] The code continues after expansion errors if severity < Error - can this allow partially-validated modules to be included in the final model? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Error Handling: Lines 249-254] [Diagnostic Severity Check] check_diags_at_or_above_severity(Severity::Warning) may miss critical errors - can an attacker ensure their malicious code produces only warnings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Sources] What happens if PackageInfo.sources is empty? Can this cause division by zero, empty collections, or bypass certain validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case: No Modules] If no modules are found in the source, does the compilation complete successfully with an empty model, potentially bypassing contract deployment requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case: Duplicate Files] Can the same source file appear in both move_sources_targets and move_sources_deps, causing it to be processed twice with different settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case: File Hash Lookup] Line 182 uses files.get(&fhash).unwrap() - can missing file hashes cause panics that crash the compiler? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case: Named Address Map Index] Line 185 accesses parsed_prog.named_address_maps.get(member.named_address_map) - can out-of-bounds indices cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Type System: Module Translation] Can an attacker craft modules with type definitions that appear valid during parsing but cause type confusion during execution? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [AST Manipulation: Module Filtering] Lines 308-322 filter modules - can this filtering accidentally remove security-critical modules from the compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Type Safety: Address Bytes Conversion] Functions use into_addr_bytes() and addr_bytes conversions - can these conversions lose precision or allow address spoofing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Flags: Line 102-109] [Compilation Flag Confusion] Can conflicting flag combinations (e.g., set_verify(true) with set_keep_testing_functions(true)) create inconsistent compilation states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Flags: skip_attribute_checks] [Attribute Validation Bypass] Can skip_attribute_checks=true allow critical security attributes to be skipped, enabling deployment of improperly attributed modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Flags: known_attributes] [Attribute Whitelist Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the known_attributes BTreeSet to include malicious attributes or exclude security-critical ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/lib.rs] [Options: compile_for_testing] [Test Code Inclusion] Can compile_for_testing flag cause test-only code with reduced security checks to be included in production builds? (High)",
