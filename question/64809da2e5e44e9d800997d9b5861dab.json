  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Consistency: Push then pop] If push() followed immediately by pop() doesn't restore the original state exactly, can repeated operations cause path drift that breaks Merkle tree invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Consistency: Truncate then extend] Can truncate() followed by push() operations create a path that differs from the original, causing state lookups to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Consistency: Iterator round-trip] If a path is reconstructed from its iterator (via from_iter()), is it guaranteed to be byte-for-byte identical to the original? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Consistency: Clone then mutate] If a path is cloned and then one copy is mutated, can the mutation affect the clone due to shared internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Edge case: Empty path operations] Can operations like last(), pop(), get_nibble(0) on an empty path cause panics or return incorrect None values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Edge case: Maximum length path] When a path reaches ROOT_NIBBLE_HEIGHT nibbles, do all operations correctly handle this boundary, or can off-by-one errors occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Edge case: Single nibble path] For paths with exactly 1 nibble, do all odd/even logic branches work correctly, or can the parity checks fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Edge case: All zeros path] Can a path consisting entirely of zero nibbles be distinguished from an empty path, and does this matter for Merkle tree operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Edge case: All ones path] Can a path with all nibbles set to 0xF (maximum value) cause overflow in any calculations that assume nibbles are typically small? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Crypto: Hash function dependency] Does the code assume cryptographic properties of the hash function used in new_from_state_key(), and what happens if those assumptions are violated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Crypto: Collision resistance] If state key hashes collide after truncation to num_nibbles bits, can this allow state overwrites or incorrect Merkle proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/nibble/nibble_path/mod.rs] [Crypto: Preimage attacks] Can an attacker craft state keys whose hashes produce specific NibblePaths that exploit tree structure weaknesses? (Medium)"
