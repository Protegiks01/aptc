  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: VERIFY] [Bytecode verifier bypass] If VERIFY flag is disabled, can malformed bytecode be generated that violates Move VM safety invariants, allowing execution of arbitrary memory operations that could leak private keys or corrupt validator state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: VERIFY + SKIP_ATTRIBUTE_CHECKS] [Combined bypass] When both VERIFY and SKIP_ATTRIBUTE_CHECKS are disabled, does this create a compilation mode where no safety checks occur, allowing deployment of Move modules that can arbitrarily mint tokens, manipulate balances, or compromise consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Function: get_move_compiler_backtrace_from_env()] [Timing side-channel] Does the boolean OR evaluation create timing differences based on which environment variable is set, potentially leaking information about validator configuration through timing analysis of compilation operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: DEBUG_FLAG] [Debug timing leak] Can enabling DEBUG_FLAG cause timing variations in compilation that leak information about code structure, optimization decisions, or security checks, allowing attackers to fingerprint Aptos framework internals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: All environment variables] [Configuration divergence] If validators have different environment variable configurations for debug/dump/backtrace flags, could this cause them to generate different error messages or warnings that lead to divergent behavior in error handling paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: LANGUAGE_VERSION] [Version skew] If validators compile with different LANGUAGE_VERSION settings during an epoch boundary, could this cause some validators to accept Move bytecode that others reject, leading to consensus disagreement and potential network split? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: OUT_DIR] [Output directory skew] If validators use different OUT_DIR paths due to filesystem layout differences, could this cause compilation caching issues where some validators use stale cached bytecode while others recompile, leading to state divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: WARN_OF_DEPRECATION_USE_IN_APTOS_LIBS_FLAG] [Aptos library bypass] Can the Wdeprecation-aptos flag be manipulated to allow governance proposals that use deprecated Aptos library functions with known vulnerabilities, enabling exploits against the staking or governance systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: DEPENDENCY + SENDER] [Framework impersonation] Can combining malicious DEPENDENCY paths with a forged SENDER address allow attackers to compile modules that impersonate Aptos framework modules, replacing core functionality with backdoored implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR] [Predictable paths] Does using the fixed DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR value 'build' create predictable filesystem paths that attackers can target for race conditions, allowing them to replace compiled bytecode with malicious versions before deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: OUT_DIR] [Directory permissions] Is OUT_DIR creation and usage properly secured with appropriate filesystem permissions, or can world-readable compilation outputs leak proprietary Move code or enable tampering by unauthorized processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR] [Directory traversal] Can MOVE_COMPILED_INTERFACES_DIR contain parent directory references (..) that enable directory traversal attacks, allowing interface files to be read from or written to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SOURCE_MAP] [Source map information leak] Do generated source maps contain sensitive information like developer comments, internal variable names, or code structure details that could reveal security vulnerabilities or intellectual property in Aptos framework code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constants: MOVE_COMPILER_DUMP_ENV_VAR + MVC_DUMP_ENV_VAR] [Bytecode dump leak] Can bytecode dumps generated by these environment variables expose intermediate representations with unoptimized security checks or reveal patterns in the Move VM that could be exploited for gas manipulation or execution bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SHADOW] [Shadow priority] When SHADOW is enabled, what is the precedence order for shadowed declarations, and can this be exploited to shadow security-critical functions with no-op implementations that bypass authentication or validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: SHADOW_SHORT] [Short shadow flag] Does the short form 'S' for SHADOW receive the same validation as the long form, or can uppercase/lowercase confusion be used to enable shadowing without triggering security warnings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: TEST] [Test-only code inclusion] Does enabling TEST flag include test-only functions or modules that bypass production security checks, and can these test paths be triggered in production to circumvent access control on staking or governance operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [Constant: TEST_SHORT] [Test flag validation] Is there proper validation to ensure TEST mode is never accidentally enabled in production compilation of Aptos mainnet governance proposals, preventing deployment of modules with test hooks or mock authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [All constants] [Constant immutability] Are all these public constants truly immutable, or can they be modified through unsafe code or FFI interfaces in other parts of the compiler, potentially changing flag behaviors at runtime? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/command_line/mod.rs] [All constants] [Name collision] Do any of these constant names collide with environment variables or flags in other parts of the Aptos stack (consensus, networking, storage), potentially causing unexpected interactions that compromise security? (Low)"
