  "[File: utils.rs] [Function: source_map_from_file()] [Error Context] Do the error messages using with_context() leak sensitive file system paths that aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",

  "[File: lib.rs + source_map.rs] [Integration] [Index Type Safety] Across all modules, are TableIndex, FunctionDefinitionIndex, StructDefinitionIndex, and ConstantPoolIndex distinct types preventing type confusion, or can indices be mixed causing security bugs? (High)",
  "[File: lib.rs + All Modules] [Unsafe Code] [Forbidden Unsafe] The #![forbid(unsafe_code)] directive prevents unsafe - but can FFI boundaries or external dependencies introduce unsafe code that bypasses this protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs + mapping.rs] [Consistency] [State Synchronization] Can SourceMapping and SourceMap fall out of sync if one is updated without the other, causing incorrect bytecode-to-source resolution? (High)",

  "[File: All Modules] [Serialization] [Version Compatibility] Do serialized SourceMap structures include version information to prevent deserialization of incompatible source map versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: All Modules] [Concurrency] [Thread Safety] Are SourceMap, SourceMapping, and MarkedSourceMapping Send+Sync safe, or can concurrent access cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [BTreeMap Operations] [Performance DoS] Can attackers craft source maps with pathological BTreeMap access patterns causing O(n) lookups degraded to O(n²) overall processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs + utils.rs] [File I/O] [Symbolic Links] Does source_map_from_file() resolve symbolic links, and can this be exploited for symlink attacks to read unintended files? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Compiler Integration] [Determinism] Is source map generation deterministic across different compilations of the same code, or can non-determinism cause validator consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Compiler Integration] [Bytecode Verification] When bytecode is verified, is the source map also validated for consistency, or can valid bytecode have malicious source maps? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Compiler Integration] [Gas Metering] Does source map size impact gas costs, and can attackers minimize gas by omitting source maps while including malicious bytecode? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Location Resolution] [Edge Cases] When Loc references span multiple files or have invalid line/column numbers, can this cause panic or undefined behavior in downstream consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Location Resolution] [File Hash Mismatch] What happens when the source_map.definition_location.file_hash() doesn't match the actual source file - can this be exploited for bait-and-switch attacks? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs + BinaryIndexedView] [VM Integration] [Module/Script Distinction] Can attackers craft bytecode that is ambiguous between Module and Script, causing dummy_from_view() to make incorrect assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [VM Integration] [Local Variable Confusion] When getting parameter_or_local_name, can the parameter count vs locals count be manipulated to cause wrong variable resolution in stack traces? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [VM Integration] [Type Parameter Limits] Does the Move VM enforce limits on type parameter counts that match source map assumptions, or can mismatches cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [VM Integration] [Code Unit Consistency] When FunctionSourceMap references CodeUnit, are code lengths validated to prevent source map entries pointing beyond actual bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [VM Integration] [Signature Index Validation] Can malformed SignatureIndex values in dummy_function_map() cause out-of-bounds access when resolving parameter types? (High)",

  "[File: source_map.rs] [Error Reporting] [Stack Trace Manipulation] Can crafted source maps cause stack traces to skip critical frames or show incorrect call chains, hiding exploit paths? (High)",
  "[File: source_map.rs] [Debugging] [Breakpoint Confusion] If debuggers rely on source maps to set breakpoints, can malicious mappings cause breakpoints to trigger at wrong offsets? (Medium)",
