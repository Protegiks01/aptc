  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Recursive serialization DoS] Can deeply nested BooleanTransactionFilter structures cause stack overflow during JSON serialization via serde at line 16, crashing the indexer when trying to serialize filter state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Strict deserialization] EventFilter uses deny_unknown_fields at line 29 - while this prevents extra fields, does it properly handle malformed JSON with missing required fields, or can partial deserialization create invalid filter states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Attribute: skip_serializing_if] [Data loss in roundtrip] At lines 33, 37, fields are skipped during serialization if None - can roundtrip serialization (serialize -> deserialize) lose filter state, causing filter behavior to change unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Unsafe deserialization] UserTransactionFilter deserialization doesn't validate sender address format - can deserializing untrusted JSON with malformed addresses cause panics when standardize_address() is later called? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Untagged ambiguity] At line 17, untagged enum deserialization tries variants in order - can JSON that matches multiple variants (e.g., both And and Filter) cause non-deterministic deserialization behavior? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Function: get_entry_function_payload_from_transaction_payload()] [Repeated extraction] This function at lines 275-294 is called for every transaction match attempt - can attackers send many non-matching transactions to cause repeated payload extraction overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [String allocation overhead] At lines 23-26 and 31-35, new Strings are allocated for every address standardization - in high-throughput scenarios with millions of transactions, can this cause memory pressure and GC overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/traits.rs] [Function: filter_vec()] [Memory allocation attack] At lines 70-75, filter_vec() collects matching items into a new Vec - can attackers send transactions that match filters but force allocation of huge result vectors causing OOM?
