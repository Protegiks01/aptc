  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Economic Parameter Manipulation] Can an attacker craft a genesis layout with min_stake (line 51) set to 0, allowing validators to join with no economic security and potentially launch a costless 51% attack during genesis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Integer Overflow] Can max_stake (line 55) be set to u64::MAX causing integer overflow when combined with rewards_apy_percentage calculations, potentially minting unlimited tokens or corrupting reward distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Voting Power Manipulation] Can voting_power_increase_limit (line 65) be set to 100 or higher, allowing a single validator to acquire >33% voting power in one epoch and compromise Byzantine fault tolerance guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Governance Bypass] Can min_voting_threshold (line 53) be set to 0, allowing proposals to pass without any votes and enabling unauthorized protocol changes or treasury drain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Consensus Timing Attack] Can epoch_duration_secs (line 44) be set to 1 second or u64::MAX, causing consensus instability through rapid epoch transitions or effectively frozen epochs that prevent validator set updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Economic Invariant Violation] Is there validation that max_stake (line 55) > min_stake (line 51), or can they be equal/inverted, breaking stake range assumptions and allowing invalid validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Integer Overflow] Can rewards_apy_percentage (line 61) exceed 100, causing overflow in reward calculations and potentially minting more tokens than total_supply during the first reward distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can employee_vesting_start (line 69) be set to 0 or a past timestamp, allowing immediate vesting unlock and violation of intended vesting schedules for employee pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Total Supply Manipulation] Is total_supply (line 67) validated against the sum of all initial balances and validator stakes, or can it be set arbitrarily low causing underflow or arbitrarily high enabling hidden inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Governance Timing Attack] Can voting_duration_secs (line 63) be set to 1 second, allowing malicious validators to pass proposals before honest validators can review and vote? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: from_disk()] [Path Traversal] Does from_disk() (line 94) validate the path parameter, or can an attacker supply '../../../etc/passwd' to read arbitrary files and leak sensitive validator keys or configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: from_disk()] [YAML Deserialization Attack] Can malicious YAML in from_disk() (lines 94-104) exploit serde_yaml parsing vulnerabilities to cause denial of service, memory exhaustion, or arbitrary code execution during genesis? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Root Key Exposure] Is root_key (line 33) properly restricted to test chains only, or can it be included in mainnet genesis allowing a single key holder to control the entire blockchain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Validator Admission Control] Can allow_new_validators (line 42) be enabled on mainnet despite being marked as ignored, allowing unrestricted validator joining and potential Sybil attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Lockup Duration Manipulation] Can recurring_lockup_duration_secs (line 57) be set to 0, allowing validators to unstake immediately without lockup period and exit with stolen funds before being detected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Proposer Stake Bypass] Can required_proposer_stake (line 59) be set to 0, allowing any account to create governance proposals regardless of stake and potentially spam the governance system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [ChainId Collision] Is chain_id (line 37) validated for uniqueness, or can two networks be initialized with the same ChainId causing transaction replay attacks across networks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: default()] [Test Configuration Leak] Can the default() implementation (lines 107-134) be accidentally used in production, exposing test-only configurations like is_test=true or low stake requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [JWK Configuration Bypass] Can jwk_consensus_config_override (line 81) be manipulated to use insecure JWK settings, compromising keyless account authentication and allowing unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: Layout] [Keyless Verification Key Substitution] Can keyless_groth16_vk_override (line 89) be replaced with an attacker-controlled verification key, allowing forged zero-knowledge proofs and unauthorized account access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfiguration] [Stake Amount Overflow] Can stake_amount (line 167) be set to u64::MAX causing overflow when calculating total stake across all validators or when adding rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Validator] [Authentication Key Mismatch] Does the validation at lines 222-230 properly prevent an attacker from supplying mismatched owner_account_address and owner_account_public_key, potentially allowing control of someone else's validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Validator] [Operator Key Validation Bypass] Can the operator key validation (lines 232-240) be bypassed by crafting special AccountAddressWithChecks that pass parsing but don't match the derived authentication key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Validator] [Voter Address Collision] Does the voter address validation (lines 242-250) prevent two validators from using the same voter account, which could allow vote manipulation or double-voting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Validator] [Consensus Key Forgery] Can consensus_public_key (line 150) be omitted but proof_of_possession (line 153) be provided, creating an invalid validator configuration that passes validation but fails during consensus? (High)"
