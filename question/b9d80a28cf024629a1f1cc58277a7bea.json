  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Cross-Component] If payload limits contradict fetcher limits or broadcast timing conflicts with round state timing, can these inconsistencies cause validators to deadlock or desynchronize? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Serde Default] Using #[serde(default)] means missing fields use defaults - can a partial configuration file accidentally enable default values that conflict with explicitly set values in other components? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Deny Unknown Fields] With deny_unknown_fields, can legitimate config evolution (adding new fields) cause old nodes to fail deserialization, preventing smooth network upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_payload_size_limits(), Lines 56-77] [Incomplete Validation] The function checks send <= recv but doesn't validate minimum thresholds - can both values be 1, causing impractical limits that effectively disable consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_payload_size_limits(), Line 69] [Logic Error] The comparison 'if *send > *recv' only catches send exceeding recv, but doesn't validate that recv is reasonable for network MTU - can recv be set to 1 byte causing all payloads to be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_payload_size_limits(), Lines 56-67] [Array Iteration] The send_recv_pairs array is iterated without bounds checking - although safe in Rust, can the tuple structure be exploited if additional pairs are added in future without updating validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize_payload_size_limits(), Line 70-73] [Error Message] The error message includes the actual values sent/recv - can this leak sensitive configuration information if error logs are accessible to attackers, aiding reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize(), Line 175] [Single Validation] Only DagPayloadConfig::sanitize() is called - why aren't other sub-configs (fetcher, rb, round_state, health) validated? Can this omission allow invalid configurations to reach production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize(), Parameters] [Unused Parameters] The function receives node_type and chain_id but DagPayloadConfig::sanitize ignores them (_node_type, _chain_id) - can this indicate incomplete validation that should vary by node type or chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_txn_limits(), Lines 186-204] [Insufficient Coverage] The test only checks txn count limits but not all edge cases - are there tests for u64::MAX values, zero values, or timing parameter extremes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Test: test_sanitize_size_limits(), Lines 207-225] [Limited Scope] Tests only validate the happy path of sanitizer catching bad configs - are there tests ensuring sanitizer doesn't reject valid configs or has false positives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Tests] [Missing Coverage] There are no tests for DagFetcherConfig, ReliableBroadcastConfig, DagRoundStateConfig, or DagHealthConfig - can untested configurations cause production issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Tests] [Integration Testing] Tests only cover individual config structs, not cross-component interactions - can valid individual configs combine into invalid overall DagConsensusConfig? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig, Fields: max_sending_txns_per_round, max_receiving_txns_per_round] [Arithmetic] When computing total txns across multiple rounds (max_txns * num_rounds), can this overflow u64, causing validators to accept more transactions than intended and breaking safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig, Fields: max_sending_size_per_round_bytes, max_receiving_size_per_round_bytes] [Memory Calculation] If payload size * validator count overflows when computing total network bandwidth, can this cause memory allocation failures or incorrect rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig, Field: payload_pull_max_poll_time_ms] [Duration Conversion] Converting ms to Duration in Rust can overflow for values near u64::MAX - does the code handle this gracefully or can it panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig, Fields: retry_interval_ms, rpc_timeout_ms] [Timeout Arithmetic] If retry_interval + rpc_timeout overflows u64 when computing total retry duration, can this cause timeouts to wrap to small values and break retry logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Exponential Backoff] Computing base * factor^iteration can overflow quickly - at what iteration count does overflow occur, and is it handled safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Concurrent Access] If multiple threads read/write DagConsensusConfig concurrently during reconfigurations, can race conditions cause partial config updates leading to inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [TOCTOU] Between sanitize() validation and actual config usage in consensus, can the config be modified by another thread, bypassing validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Clone Trait] All structs implement Clone - can concurrent cloning during config hot-reload cause torn reads where some fields are from old config and others from new? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig, Field: max_concurrent_fetches] [Race Condition] If multiple threads check and increment concurrent fetch count against max_concurrent_fetches simultaneously, can this allow exceeding the limit due to non-atomic increment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Serde Deny Unknown] With deny_unknown_fields, can malicious config files with extra fields cause deserialization to fail during critical recovery scenarios, preventing node restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Serde Default] Using #[serde(default)] means all missing fields get defaults - can an attacker provide minimal config that mostly uses defaults, some of which may be insecure for specific deployment scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Fields: chain_backoff_config, pipeline_backpressure_config] [Complex Types] These Vec fields contain complex types from other modules - can malicious payloads in these vectors exploit deserialization bugs in those types? (Medium)"
