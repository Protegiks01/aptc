  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: bytes()] [Borrow checker bypass] Can the Bytes type's implementation allow borrow checker bypass, enabling simultaneous mutable and immutable references to module bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Struct: AptosModuleExtension] [Memory layout] Can attackers exploit the memory layout of the three fields (bytes, hash, metadata) to perform buffer overflows or OOB reads through unsafe pointer arithmetic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/vm/modules.rs] [Function: AptosModuleExtension::new()] [Drop implementation] Does AptosModuleExtension or its fields have custom Drop implementations that could cause double-free or use-after-free if panics occur during destruction? (High)"
