  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: Time::new()] [Timestamp Overflow] Lines 1472-1473 use deprecated from_timestamp_opt which can return None for invalid timestamps - but the unwrap() will panic instead of handling this gracefully, can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: Time::new()] [Deprecated Function Warning] Lines 1471-1475 use deprecated timestamp functions - are these safe against Y2038 problem or timestamp overflow issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: Time::new_micros()] [Microsecond Overflow] Line 1484 converts u64 microseconds to Duration - can this overflow for timestamps beyond ~584,942 years, and should it validate input? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Module: NodeTool] [Command Injection] Does the execute() dispatcher properly validate that all subcommands sanitize their inputs, or can malicious input to one command affect the execution of another? (Medium)",
