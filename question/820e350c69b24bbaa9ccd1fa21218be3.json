  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [String Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious content into the OpenAPI spec that gets served to clients by exploiting the simple string replace operation on line 24, potentially causing XSS or other client-side attacks when the spec is rendered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Pattern Matching] Does the replace operation on line 24 using '; charset=utf-8' create vulnerabilities if the underlying spec_yaml() or spec() methods return strings containing multiple occurrences of this pattern, potentially removing legitimate content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Content Integrity] Can the string replacement operation on line 24 be exploited to corrupt the OpenAPI specification structure if charset declarations appear in unexpected locations within the JSON/YAML content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Unicode Exploitation] Can malicious Unicode characters in the spec content bypass the charset removal logic or cause unexpected behavior when the replace operation is executed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Content-Type Mismatch] Can an attacker exploit the hardcoded 'application/json' content type on line 38 to serve malicious content that is incorrectly interpreted by clients expecting valid JSON? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Content-Type Injection] Does the 'application/x-yaml' content type on line 54 properly protect against YAML deserialization attacks when clients parse the specification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Header Injection] Can the Content-Disposition header on line 55 be exploited for header injection attacks if the filename 'spec.yaml' or inline directive is not properly validated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [MIME Type Confusion] Can the application/x-yaml MIME type on line 54 cause browser or client confusion attacks where the spec is executed as code rather than displayed as documentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Information Leakage] Does the OpenAPI specification generated by service.spec() or service.spec_yaml() on lines 20-23 leak sensitive internal API details, endpoints, or parameters that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Sensitive Data Exposure] Can the publicly accessible JSON spec endpoint expose internal validator endpoints, admin interfaces, or other security-sensitive API routes that should not be documented publicly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Schema Disclosure] Does the YAML specification expose detailed schema information including validation rules, constraints, or business logic that could be exploited by attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Version Information] Can the OpenAPI spec expose version information about the Aptos node, dependencies, or framework versions that could be used to identify vulnerable installations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can repeated requests to the spec endpoint cause memory exhaustion since the spec is cloned on every request (line 39) without rate limiting or caching optimization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Clone Performance] Does cloning the potentially large spec string on line 56 for every request create a DoS vector where attackers can degrade API node performance by repeatedly requesting the YAML spec? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [String Allocation] Can the string allocation and replace operation on line 24 cause memory issues if the underlying spec() or spec_yaml() methods return extremely large specifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Move Semantics] Is the spec.clone() operation on line 39 necessary, or does it create unnecessary memory overhead that could be avoided with move semantics or Arc references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Spec Generation Race] Can concurrent calls to get_spec() from different endpoints (JSON and YAML) cause race conditions if the underlying OpenApiService state is modified during spec generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Closure Capture] Does the closure on line 36 that captures 'spec' create thread-safety issues if the OpenApiService is modified after endpoint creation but before request handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Concurrent Modification] Can the spec string captured in the closure on line 52 become stale or inconsistent if the API service is updated dynamically at runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Generic Type Bounds] Can the generic type constraints 'T: OpenApi' and 'W: Webhook' on lines 15-17 be bypassed or exploited if malicious implementations of these traits are provided? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Lifetime Issues] Does the 'use<T, W>' syntax on line 30 properly capture all necessary lifetimes, or could dangling references occur if the OpenApiService is dropped prematurely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Type Erasure] Can type erasure in the impl Endpoint return type on line 46 hide security-relevant type information needed for proper validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Response Builder] Can the Response::builder() chain on lines 37-39 be exploited if any step in the builder pattern fails silently or returns an error that is not properly handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Header Ordering] Does the order of setting content_type on line 54 before the Content-Disposition header on line 55 create any security implications for how browsers handle the response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Body Encoding] Is the spec string properly UTF-8 encoded when set as the response body on line 39, or could encoding issues cause corruption or injection vulnerabilities? (Low)"
