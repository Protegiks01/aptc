(Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: get_init_features()] [Feature manipulation] The function modifies default_benchmark_features() - can enabling/disabling specific combinations of features (e.g., disabling gas metering) create unsafe execution environments that could affect production if the benchmark config is copied? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Panic condition] The panic at line 545-547 for invalid hotspot_probability - can this be triggered in production-like environments where the benchmark is scripted, causing unexpected failures? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: run()] [Feature default risk] In Command::AddAccounts at line 584, Features::default() is used instead of get_init_features() - can this create inconsistencies where added accounts have different feature settings than the original database?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Time manipulation] The START_TIME gauge at lines 594-599 uses SystemTime::now() - can system time manipulation (e.g., time going backwards) cause negative durations or panics in the unwrap()? (Low)",
