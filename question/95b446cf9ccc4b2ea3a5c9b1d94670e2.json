  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Field: token_id] [Nested struct depth] TokenId contains TokenDataId which contains multiple fields - can deeply nested BCS structures cause stack overflow during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Integration] [Event-state desync] Can the Claim event be emitted successfully but the actual token deposit fail in token_transfers::claim(), causing events to show claims that never completed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Integration] [Feature flag confusion] The Move module emits different event types based on module_event_migration_enabled() - can this flag be manipulated mid-execution to emit wrong event types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Integration] [Cross-module call] Since claim.rs is in types crate but token_transfers.move emits events, can module boundary violations allow unauthorized event emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Integration] [Account resource check bypass] Does the Rust Claim struct validation align with Move module checks, or can events be created that violate Move module invariants? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Indexer processing] [Missing event handling] If indexers fail to process certain Claim events (due to parsing errors or crashes), can this create incomplete transaction histories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [API exposure] [Privacy violation] Does exposing account and to_address in Claim events reveal sensitive transaction patterns that could be exploited for front-running? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [API exposure] [Event flooding] Can an attacker query Claim events at scale to map out the entire token transfer graph and identify high-value targets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Cross-chain] [Bridge replay] If Claim events are used by bridges to verify token movements, can the same event be replayed on another chain to double-claim tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/claim.rs] [Cross-chain] [ChainId missing] The Claim struct has no chain_id field - can events from testnet be replayed on mainnet or vice versa? (Critical)",
