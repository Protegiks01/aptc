  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Backwards compatibility] If the Error enum changes (new variants added), could old peers deserializing new errors cause panics or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Zero-copy deserialization] Are there any zero-copy deserialization patterns that could allow attackers to reference malicious data without proper validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Rust safety] [String handling] Does the use of owned Strings in error variants prevent any use-after-free or dangling pointer issues, or could lifetime issues arise in complex error handling scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/error.rs] [Rust safety] [Panic on error conversion] Could the to_string() call in the From implementation panic on malformed network errors, causing denial of service or inconsistent error handling? (Medium)",
