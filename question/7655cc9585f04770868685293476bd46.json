  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Silent failures] When the table handle is invalid or the table is empty, does consuming code properly detect and handle this? Can silent failures lead to incorrect governance decisions where missing voting records are interpreted as 'no votes cast'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Address arithmetic] AccountAddress is typically 32 bytes - if code performs arithmetic on the table handle address (e.g., incrementing to scan tables), can integer overflows or wrapping cause incorrect table addresses and unauthorized data access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [No integrity protection] The struct has no signature or hash field to verify its authenticity - can an attacker provide a crafted VotingRecords with a malicious table handle, and would consuming code detect this tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [No proof verification] When querying voting records using the table handle, are Merkle proofs verified to ensure the data actually exists on-chain? Can an attacker respond with fake voting records that aren't cryptographically proven? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Voting manipulation] If an attacker can control the table handle value in VotingRecords, can they redirect voting record queries to a table they control, effectively manipulating which proposals appear to have been voted on? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Proposal censorship] Can an attacker provide a VotingRecords with a table handle pointing to an empty table, making it appear that no votes have been cast on any proposals, effectively censoring governance participation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Double voting detection bypass] Since the struct only holds a table reference, can attackers exploit timing windows where the table is read multiple times to cast votes, check records, and cast again before the first vote is committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [API response manipulation] When the REST API deserializes VotingRecords from blockchain state, can a malicious full node operator modify the response to include an incorrect table handle, causing clients to read fake voting data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Network deserialization] When VotingRecords is transmitted over the network (e.g., in state sync), are there size limits or validation to prevent DoS via extremely large serialized payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Breaking changes] If the AccountAddress type changes its internal representation in a future Rust compiler or aptos-core version, can this break VotingRecords deserialization or cause incompatibilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Backward compatibility] When reading historical blockchain state with old VotingRecords format, does the current code handle legacy formats correctly or can this cause state reconstruction failures during replay? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Misleading documentation] The struct has no documentation comments explaining that 'votes' is a table handle - can this mislead developers into incorrectly using it, causing security vulnerabilities in applications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing safety invariants] There's no documentation of safety invariants (e.g., 'votes must be a valid table handle owned by governance module') - can lack of documented invariants lead to violations and security bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Thread safety] The struct derives Debug but doesn't implement Send/Sync explicitly - if code incorrectly assumes thread safety and shares VotingRecords across threads, can this cause data races or corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Concurrent queries] When multiple API requests query voting records using the same VotingRecords table handle concurrently, can database-level race conditions cause inconsistent results or deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Zero address] Can the 'votes' field be set to the zero address (0x0)? If so, does this cause special behavior, panics, or allow bypassing governance checks by querying a non-existent table? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Maximum address] Can the 'votes' field be set to the maximum AccountAddress value (all 0xFF bytes)? Could this cause integer overflow when computing table keys or offsets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Reserved addresses] Are there reserved AccountAddress ranges that should not be used as table handles? Can using special system addresses as table handles bypass access controls or cause privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Duplicate handles] Can multiple VotingRecords instances point to the same table handle? If so, can concurrent modifications through different instances cause state corruption or inconsistent views? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [CLI deserialization] The governance CLI uses get_account_resource_bcs to deserialize VotingRecords - if the node returns malicious data, can this cause the CLI to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Unwrap usage] The CLI code calls .unwrap() after deserializing VotingRecords - can this cause the CLI to panic and crash if deserialization fails, denying service to governance participants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Missing tests] The file has no associated unit tests - can lack of testing mean that serialization bugs, type confusion, or edge cases remain undetected until exploited in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Fuzzing gaps] Has the struct been fuzz tested with random or malicious serialized inputs? Can unfuzzed deserialization paths contain vulnerabilities that crash nodes or cause consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/governance.rs] [Struct: VotingRecords] [Module isolation] Can code in other modules (e.g., mempool, consensus) accidentally use VotingRecords in unsafe ways, such as directly manipulating the votes field, bypassing intended security boundaries? (Medium)"
