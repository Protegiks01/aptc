  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::evict()] [Stale Data] Can evict() fail to invalidate all references to evicted entries, allowing stale cached data to persist and be used in consensus decisions leading to validator divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::evict()] [Key Confusion] Can an attacker evict cache entries using keys that collide due to modulo operations, unintentionally removing valid cached data and causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::evict()] [Memory Leak] Does evict() properly drop the evicted entry's key and value, or can failure to release memory lead to gradual memory leaks in long-running validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::total_size()] [Size Overflow] Can total_size() return incorrect values due to integer overflow from accumulated size_in_bytes, causing eviction policies to fail and cache to grow unbounded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::total_size()] [Atomicity] Does total_size() provide a consistent snapshot of cache size, or can race conditions cause it to return stale or incorrect values during concurrent insert/evict operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::total_size()] [Size Drift] Can cumulative rounding errors or race conditions cause total_size() to drift from the actual cache size over time, leading to incorrect eviction decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::total_size()] [Memory Ordering] Can implementations use relaxed memory ordering that causes total_size() to return inconsistent values across different CPU cores in a validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::capacity()] [Capacity Mutation] Does the trait contract guarantee that capacity() returns a constant value, or can implementations allow capacity to change at runtime in ways that violate cache invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::capacity()] [Zero Capacity] Can implementations return zero from capacity(), causing division-by-zero errors in key-to-index mapping logic using modulo operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache::capacity()] [Inconsistent Capacity] Can capacity() return different values over time or across threads, causing validators to have inconsistent cache behavior leading to state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Send/Sync Bounds] Are the Send + Sync trait bounds sufficient to guarantee thread safety, or can implementations have interior mutability that violates thread safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Data Races] Can concurrent access to SizedCache implementations cause data races in the absence of proper synchronization primitives like Mutex or RwLock? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SizedCache] [Lock-Free Violations] If implementations use lock-free data structures, can ABA problems or lost updates cause cache corruption and validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache] [Hash Collision] Can the Eq + Hash trait bounds on K allow attackers to craft keys with hash collisions that cause cache poisoning or denial-of-service attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache] [Clone Cost] Can expensive Clone implementations on K or V types be exploited to cause denial-of-service during cache operations that require cloning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache] [Type Safety] Do the Send + Sync bounds on K and V prevent all possible thread-safety violations, or can types with unsafe interior mutability still cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache::get()] [Stale Reads] Can get() return stale cached values that diverge from the authoritative state source, causing validators to make consensus decisions on incorrect data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-in-memory-cache/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Cache::get()] [Clone Safety] Does returning Option<V> by cloning prevent use-after-free bugs, or can implementations with custom clone logic introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
