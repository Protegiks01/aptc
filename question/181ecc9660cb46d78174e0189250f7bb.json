  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Branch Hijacking] Can an attacker who has compromised a dependency repository force-push malicious code to a branch, and will reset_hard() fetch and apply these changes without verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Information Disclosure] When clone() fails, does the error message leak sensitive information about internal paths, authentication credentials, or network topology that could aid further attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Error Message Injection] Can malicious dep_name or rev values containing control characters or ANSI escape sequences be used to inject fake error messages or manipulate terminal output to mislead users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Timing Attack] Does the time taken for fetch_origin() to fail reveal information about whether a repository exists at a given URL, enabling enumeration of private repositories? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_rev()] [Output Validation] Does find_rev() properly validate that the stdout output is a valid commit hash format, or can git return unexpected output that causes downstream parsing errors or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: find_tag()] [Output Injection] Can the tag list returned by find_tag() contain malicious strings or injection payloads that get unsafely processed by calling code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Credential Exposure] Does clone() inadvertently expose authentication credentials (tokens, passwords) through command-line arguments visible in process listings or logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Authentication Bypass] Can an attacker bypass authentication by exploiting git's credential helper system or using specially crafted URLs that skip authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Credential Theft] When fetch_origin() interacts with remote repositories, can it be exploited to exfiltrate stored git credentials (SSH keys, HTTP tokens) to attacker-controlled servers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [MitM Attack] Does clone() verify git server certificates and signatures, or is it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that serve malicious repositories over compromised networks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Disk Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a URL to an extremely large repository (hundreds of GB) causing clone() to exhaust disk space and crash the package resolution process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Network Exhaustion] Is there any timeout or size limit on clone() operations, or can attackers provide URLs to slow/large repositories that hang indefinitely and block package builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can repeated calls to fetch_origin() with malicious repositories cause excessive network traffic or disk I/O that degrades system performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Repository Corruption] If reset_hard() is called repeatedly with different revisions, can it cause git repository corruption or excessive disk usage from unreferenced objects? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Environment Variable Injection] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables (GIT_CONFIG, GIT_SSH_COMMAND, GIT_PROXY_COMMAND) to alter clone() behavior and inject malicious commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Git Config Exploitation] Does checkout() inherit potentially malicious git config settings from the cloned repository that could alter subsequent git operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: confirm_git_available()] [PATH Hijacking] Can an attacker place a malicious 'git' binary in the PATH before the legitimate one, causing all git operations to execute attacker-controlled code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Working Directory Confusion] Does clone() execute in a controlled working directory, or can attackers exploit current working directory state to access unintended files through relative paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Output Suppression Risk] By redirecting stdout/stderr to null, does clone() hide critical security warnings from git (e.g., certificate errors, suspicious submodules) that users should see? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Silent Failure Risk] With stdio suppressed, can checkout() silently fail in dangerous ways (e.g., partial checkout, hook execution) without proper error detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Warning Suppression] Does suppressing git output in fetch_origin() hide important security warnings about repository authenticity, TLS issues, or deprecated protocols? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Destructive Operation Risk] Given that reset_hard() performs destructive operations with suppressed output, can errors or warnings about data loss be missed, leading to unintended consequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [URL Format Validation] Does clone() validate that the URL parameter follows expected git URL formats, or can malformed URLs cause git to behave unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [PackageName Injection] Can the dep_name parameter contain malicious strings or path traversal sequences that get unsafely interpolated into error messages or log files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Revision Format Validation] Does checkout() validate that 'rev' is a valid git reference format before use, or can invalid formats cause git to interpret it as something dangerous? (Medium)"
