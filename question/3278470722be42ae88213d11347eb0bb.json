  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Event Loss] Are there scenarios where EventHandle count is incremented but the event is lost (network partition, crash), causing permanent sequence number gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Handle Validation] Does create_event_v1() validate that the EventHandle passed at line 9 is properly initialized and not corrupted, or can malformed handles cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Self Validation] Is the 'self' parameter validated to ensure it's a valid Move struct instance, or can unsafe code pass invalid memory causing crashes during serialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Null/Default Values] Can default-initialized or zero-valued structs cause issues when serialized at line 16, potentially creating malformed events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [V1 vs V2] Does create_event_v1() properly distinguish between V1 and V2 event formats, or could mixing versions cause event parsing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Protocol Upgrade] If the event format changes during a protocol upgrade, can old create_event_v1() calls create incompatible events that break indexers or break consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Deprecation] Is MoveEventV1Type marked as deprecated, and if so, are there migration issues where old events using V1 format conflict with new V2 events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Event Hash] Does the ContractEvent created include a cryptographic hash of its contents, or can events be modified in transit without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Signature Verification] Are events signed by the emitting account, or can any code emit events on behalf of other accounts by manipulating the EventKey? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Zero Sequence] Does the initial event (sequence_number = 0) have any special handling, or can attackers exploit assumptions about non-zero sequence numbers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Empty Data] Can create_event_v1() be called with an empty struct that serializes to zero bytes, and if so, are empty events properly handled by storage and indexing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Function: create_event_v1()] [Maximum Events] What happens when an EventHandle reaches u64::MAX events - is there graceful degradation or does the system become unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Module: move_event_v1] [Public Interface] Is the trait MoveEventV1Type intended to be publicly implementable, or should it be sealed to prevent external implementations that could bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Module: move_event_v1] [Export Safety] Are all types and functions in this module properly scoped, or could pub visibility allow external crates to misuse internal event creation APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Dependencies] [ContractEvent] Does the ContractEvent::new_v1() function (line 12) perform all necessary validation, or does create_event_v1() need additional checks before calling it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Dependencies] [EventHandle] Does the EventHandle type properly enforce invariants (immutable key, monotonic count), or can external mutation break assumptions in create_event_v1()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v1.rs] [Dependencies] [MoveStructType] Does the MoveStructType trait guarantee that struct_tag() returns a valid and unique tag, or can malicious implementations cause type collisions? (Medium)",
