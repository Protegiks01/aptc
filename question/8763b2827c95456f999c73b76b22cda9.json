  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Dependencies] [SeedableRng] from_seed trait is used - can incorrect seed sizes or padding cause weak key generation or RNG state collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Dependencies] [Reqwest URL] Uses reqwest::Url for URL construction - can URL parsing vulnerabilities allow SSRF or open redirect attacks via malicious socket addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Resource Management] [Test Directory] test_dir is used for config and data storage - can improper cleanup leave sensitive validator keys on disk after testnet shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Resource Management] [Thread Handle] node_thread_handle is never joined - can this cause resource leaks or prevent graceful shutdown when the node needs to stop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Resource Management] [Config Cloning] NodeConfig is cloned/moved but not explicitly cleaned - can sensitive data persist in memory after NodeManager is dropped? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty PathBuf] Can config_path or test_config_override be empty PathBuf, causing file operations to target current directory unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Edge Case] [Port Zero] Can txn_stream_port be set to 0, requesting OS to assign random port, causing URL construction to return invalid 'http://127.0.0.1:0' addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Edge Case] [Very Long Paths] Can extremely long PathBuf values cause buffer overflows or path truncation in underlying filesystem operations during config loading? (Low)"
