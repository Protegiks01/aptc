  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Serialization] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft JSON where chain_id or version are not u64 (e.g., negative numbers, floats, strings) to cause deserialization failures or type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Serialization] [JSON Injection] Can special characters in transaction strings within TransactionsBlob cause JSON injection vulnerabilities when the blob is serialized and later parsed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Serialization] [Encoding Issues] Are there any UTF-8 encoding issues with transaction strings that could cause serialization to fail or produce invalid JSON? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Version Tracking] [Monotonic Increase] Is there enforcement that metadata.version always increases monotonically, or can version numbers decrease causing confusion about which transactions have been processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Version Tracking] [Gap Detection] If there are gaps in version numbers (e.g., version jumps from 1000 to 3000), is this detected and handled, or do indexers silently skip processing 1000 transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Version Tracking] [Initial Version] Can metadata.version be initialized to a non-zero value, and if so, how do indexers know not to process transactions before that version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Version Tracking] [Version Overflow Handling] When version approaches u64::MAX, is there a migration strategy or does the system fail catastrophically requiring manual intervention? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Version Tracking] [Blob Boundary Alignment] Are version numbers always aligned to BLOB_TRANSACTION_CHUNK_SIZE boundaries, or can misaligned versions cause partial blob reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic-Driven Crashes] Both get_file_store_metadata() and upload_file_store_metadata() use .expect()/.unwrap() that panic on errors - can transient network issues cause repeated indexer crashes requiring manual restarts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [No Retry Logic] Do the storage functions implement retry logic with exponential backoff, or do they fail immediately on transient errors causing unnecessary service disruptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Error Propagation] Should these functions return Result types for proper error handling instead of panicking, allowing callers to implement recovery strategies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Error Handling] [Partial Failure] If Object::create() partially succeeds (uploads some bytes but not all), can this leave corrupted metadata that crashes all subsequent readers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Concurrency] [Async Function Safety] Are get_file_store_metadata() and upload_file_store_metadata() designed to be called concurrently from multiple async tasks, or can this cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Concurrency] [Read-Modify-Write] Is there a critical read-modify-write race condition where multiple indexers read metadata, increment version, and write back, causing lost updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock-Free Design] Does the storage layer implement any locking or consensus mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications, or is it vulnerable to write conflicts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Concurrency] [Distributed Consistency] In a distributed deployment with multiple indexer instances, how is metadata consistency maintained, or can different indexers diverge in their view of current version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Data Integrity] [Checksum Validation] Does FileStoreMetadata include any checksums or cryptographic hashes to detect tampering, or can modified metadata go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Data Integrity] [Blob Integrity] Is there any mechanism to verify that a blob's contents match its declared starting_version and transaction count? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Data Integrity] [Signature Verification] Should metadata be digitally signed by the uploading indexer to prevent unauthorized modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Data Integrity] [Immutability] Once a blob is uploaded, is it immutable, or can attackers overwrite historical transaction data by uploading new blobs with the same version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Chain ID] [Validation] Is chain_id validated against a known list of valid chain IDs, or can arbitrary values be used potentially mixing testnet and mainnet data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Chain ID] [Immutability] Once set, can chain_id be changed, or is it immutable for the lifetime of the file store? Changing it mid-operation could cause catastrophic data corruption. (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Chain ID] [Cross-Chain Attack] Can an attacker with access to multiple chain file stores mix transaction blobs from different chains to cause cross-chain replay or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Chain ID] [Zero Value] Is chain_id=0 a valid value, and if so, does this have special meaning or can it be confused with uninitialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Blob Management] [Directory Structure] Is the BLOB_FOLDER_NAME directory structure flat or hierarchical, and can a large number of blobs (millions) cause file system or cloud storage performance degradation? (Medium)"
