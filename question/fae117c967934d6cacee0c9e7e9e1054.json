  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Module visibility] [Metric export] Are all metrics defined as 'pub static' (lines 32, 42, 52, 62, 71, 81, 91, 99) exported through a public metrics endpoint, and does this expose sensitive validator operational data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Constant visibility] [Label exposure] Are the GAS_ESTIMATE constants (lines 12-14) marked 'pub const' allowing external code to construct metric queries, potentially enabling metric enumeration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Static: GAS_ESTIMATE] [Type conversion] Does converting DEFAULT_BUCKETS integers to f64 (line 76) risk precision loss for large gas values, potentially causing incorrect bucketing of gas estimates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Static: BYTE_BUCKETS] [Float precision] Can floating-point bucket boundaries (lines 26-28) cause precision issues where payloads near bucket edges are inconsistently classified across different architectures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/metrics.rs] [Constant: SUB_MS_BUCKETS] [Bucket type] Are SUB_MS_BUCKETS defined as f64 slice (line 20) correctly matching histogram requirements, or could type mismatches cause runtime issues? (Low)"
