  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Serde defaults] Do all fields handle serde(default) correctly, or can missing fields during deserialization create ConsensusState with uninitialized or zero values that bypass safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Serialization format] Can different serde formats (JSON vs bincode) produce different ConsensusState representations, causing consensus divergence if validators use different formats? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Version upgrade] When upgrading SafetyData schema (as shown in test_safety_data_upgrade), can ConsensusState incorrectly deserialize old formats, losing critical safety fields? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: in_validator_set()] [Set membership] Can a validator set in_validator_set=true without their public key being in the EpochState verifier, allowing them to sign votes that fail verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: in_validator_set()] [Dynamic changes] If the validator set changes mid-epoch through emergency governance action, does in_validator_set reflect the change, or do validators operate with stale membership? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: in_validator_set()] [False negatives] Can in_validator_set incorrectly return false for active validators due to bugs, causing them to refuse voting and harm liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Trust root] Since waypoint serves as the trust root for epoch change proofs, can an attacker who controls storage modify it to point to a malicious chain fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Version ordering] Can waypoint.version be set to a future version that doesn't exist yet, causing validators to reject all valid epoch change proofs as being 'too old'? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: waypoint()] [Genesis waypoint] Can the waypoint be reset to the genesis waypoint through storage manipulation, causing validators to forget all chain history and accept old forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Equality semantics] Does PartialEq correctly compare all fields including safety_data.last_vote, or can two unequal ConsensusStates be considered equal due to incomplete comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Hash collisions] Is ConsensusState hashed for any security-critical purposes, and if so, can crafted instances produce hash collisions to bypass deduplication or caching? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Lifetime issues] Do all ConsensusState methods properly handle lifetimes, or can references outlive the underlying data in safety_data or waypoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Ownership transfer] Can ConsensusState be moved while references to its fields exist, creating dangling pointers or use-after-free conditions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [State exposure] Since ConsensusState is created by SafetyRules.guarded_consensus_state() for monitoring, can exposing this state to external APIs help attackers predict validator behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Function: safety_data()] [Signature extraction] The cloned SafetyData contains last_vote with the validator's signature - can extracting this signature help forge votes or compromise the validator's key? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/consensus_state.rs] [Struct: ConsensusState] [Error propagation] Do ConsensusState methods properly propagate errors from SafetyData access, or can error swallowing hide critical storage failures? (High)"
