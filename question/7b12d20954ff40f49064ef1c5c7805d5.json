(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Lines: 9-11] [Platform-specific behavior] Does the conditional compilation using jemalloc only on Unix systems create inconsistent memory behavior between platforms that could be exploited to cause non-deterministic service failures or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Lines: 9-11] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger jemalloc's allocation patterns to cause excessive memory fragmentation, leading to memory exhaustion and service unavailability despite having sufficient physical memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Lines: 9-11] [Use-after-free] Are there any unsafe memory access patterns in the indexer service that could interact with jemalloc's allocation/deallocation to cause use-after-free vulnerabilities when processing malformed transaction data?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 13] [Async runtime panic] If a panic occurs in any tokio task spawned by the indexer service, does the tokio::main macro properly propagate the panic to exit the process, or could it silently continue serving corrupted data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 13] [Task scheduling attack] Can an attacker craft specific gRPC requests that spawn an excessive number of tokio tasks, causing task queue saturation and preventing legitimate indexer queries from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 13] [Runtime configuration] Does the default tokio runtime configuration use an appropriate number of worker threads, or could insufficient threading lead to head-of-line blocking where malicious slow requests block fast queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 13] [Async cancellation] Are tokio task cancellations handled safely throughout the service, or could abrupt client disconnections leave the indexer in an inconsistent state with partially processed transaction streams? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 13] [Deadlock potential] Can the tokio runtime enter a deadlock state if all worker threads become blocked waiting for resources (e.g., database connections) while holding critical locks needed by connection cleanup tasks?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 15] [Argument injection] If the service is launched via a script or orchestrator, could command line injection allow an attacker to pass additional arguments that modify security-critical behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 15] [Missing validation] Does ServerArgs::parse() properly validate that a config_path argument is provided, or could omitting it cause undefined behavior or default to an insecure configuration location?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service-v2/src/main.rs] [Line: 16] [Initialization race] Are there race conditions between the health check server startup and main service initialization that could allow health checks to report 'ready' before security-critical components are fully initialized?
