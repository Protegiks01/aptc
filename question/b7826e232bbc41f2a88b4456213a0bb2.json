  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: InnerPool] [Integer overflow consistency] If strings.len() and lookup.len() disagree due to overflow at different sizes, can this cause symbol resolution to fail non-deterministically across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: inner RefCell] [Concurrent mutation] Since RefCell only provides runtime borrow checking, can concurrent access from multiple threads cause data races if SymbolPool is wrapped in Arc and shared across validator threads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: inner RefCell] [Panic in critical path] If RefCell::borrow_mut() panics during Move module compilation in consensus critical path, will this cause validator to crash and miss block proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: inner RefCell] [Nested borrow] Can operations that call both borrow() and borrow_mut() in nested scopes cause panic, especially if make() internally needs to call string() for validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: inner RefCell] [Poison on panic] If a panic occurs while inner is mutably borrowed, does RefCell leave SymbolPool in inconsistent state that causes subsequent operations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: lookup HashMap] [Hash DoS] Can attackers craft Move module identifiers that hash to same buckets, causing O(n) lookup degradation and slowing down module compilation during consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: lookup HashMap] [Key equality edge case] Does Rc<String> equality check work correctly for all Unicode strings, or can normalization differences cause different strings to be treated as duplicates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: lookup HashMap] [Capacity overflow] Can HashMap capacity overflow when storing billions of symbols, causing allocation failures or incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: lookup HashMap] [Entry API race] If lookup.insert() is used without checking get() first in a concurrent scenario, can duplicate entries be created causing symbol inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: strings Vec] [Index confusion] Since symbols are usize indices into strings Vec, can negative indices or underflow cause wrong symbol retrieval if Symbol is constructed maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: strings Vec] [Unbounded growth] Can strings Vec grow indefinitely during long-running validator operation, eventually exhausting memory as more Move modules are processed without cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: strings Vec] [Reallocation cost] When strings Vec reallocates during push(), can this cause unpredictable latency spikes that affect consensus timing if it happens during block production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Field: strings Vec] [Shared Rc ownership] Since both strings Vec and lookup HashMap hold Rc references, can dropping SymbolPool cause cascading Rc decrements that block validator threads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: Symbol::new() in tests] [Test-only constructor abuse] Can the cfg(test) Symbol::new() constructor be exploited if test dependencies leak into production builds, allowing arbitrary symbol creation without pool validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: Symbol::new() in tests] [Arbitrary index creation] Does Symbol::new(val) allow creation of symbols with indices beyond pool bounds, potentially causing panics when used with string() in production code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: SymbolDisplay] [Lifetime violation] Can SymbolDisplay outlive its referenced SymbolPool if stored incorrectly, causing use-after-free when fmt() is called later? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: SymbolDisplay::fmt()] [Panic in formatting] If string() panics due to invalid Symbol, will fmt() propagate the panic and crash during error message formatting, hiding the original error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Function: SymbolDisplay::fmt()] [Allocation in fmt] Does pool.string(*self.sym) allocate during formatting, potentially causing OOM in error handling paths when displaying many symbols? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Trait: PartialEq for Symbol] [Cross-pool comparison] Can two symbols with same usize value from different pools be considered equal, even though they represent different strings, causing Move type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Trait: Hash for Symbol] [Hash collision with usize] Does hashing only the usize value make symbol hashing deterministic across validator nodes, or can pointer values leak into the hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Trait: Ord for Symbol] [Ordering inconsistency] Can symbol ordering differ across validators if different strings are assigned different indices due to race conditions in make()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Trait: Clone for Symbol] [Cheap clone assumption] Does Copy trait on Symbol assume it's always safe to copy, or can copied symbols outlive their source pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Trait: Default for SymbolPool] [Initialization state] Does Default::default() create SymbolPool in a safe initial state, or could uninitialized fields cause issues in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall design] [Non-determinism in compilation] If different validators process Move modules in different orders, can their SymbolPools assign different indices to same strings, causing non-deterministic bytecode generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/symbol.rs] [Overall design] [Symbol serialization] Are Symbols ever serialized for storage or network transmission, and if so, how is cross-node symbol resolution handled to prevent symbol index mismatch? (High)"
