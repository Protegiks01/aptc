(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: verify_share()] [Scalar size mismatch] If coeffs.len() at line 87 doesn't equal apk.len(), the multi-exp at lines 94-95 may silently truncate or pad - can this cause verification to pass when it shouldn't, or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Weight manipulation] At line 116, get_player_weight() determines how many sub-players to create - can Byzantine validators provide a WeightedConfigBlstrs with manipulated weights to over-represent themselves in the Lagrange interpolation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Zero weight attack] If get_player_weight() returns 0 for a player at line 116, the inner loop (j in 0..0) won't execute - can a Byzantine player claim zero weight to exclude themselves from verification while still participating in consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: aggregate_shares()] [Maximum weight violation] Is there a cap on get_player_weight()?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: augment_pubkey()] [Unused delta parameter] Line 63-69 shows augment_pubkey() ignores the delta parameter - if delta is meant to add randomness for security, is this safe?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Function: get_public_delta()] [Unit type delta] Line 59-61 returns &() as Delta - does this mean there's no public randomness in key augmentation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/weighted_vuf/bls/mod.rs] [Type: AugmentedSecretKeyShare] [No actual augmentation] Lines 38-39 show AugmentedSecretKeyShare = SecretKeyShare with no actual augmentation - if other VUF implementations (like PinkasWUF) do augment keys, can this inconsistency cause protocol confusion attacks?
