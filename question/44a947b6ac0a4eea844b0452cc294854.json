  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Network Timeout] If the client.get_ledger_information() hangs or times out, can this cause indefinite blocking in package resolution, leading to build system DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Identity Collision] Does CanonicalNodeIdentity properly normalize URLs to prevent different representations of same node from creating separate lock entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [TOCTOU Race] Can concurrent calls to resolve_network_version() for same URL result in race conditions where multiple network requests are made and entries overwrite each other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Client Clone Cost] The client.clone() for fullnode_url - is this an expensive operation that could be exploited for resource exhaustion in high-frequency resolution scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Response Parsing] Does into_inner().version safely handle all possible response types from the REST API, or can malformed/malicious responses cause panics or incorrect version extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [BTreeMap Key Collision] Can different git repositories or nodes with carefully crafted URLs result in identical string keys in the BTreeMap, causing unintended key collisions and dependency confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker add unlimited entries to git or on_chain BTreeMaps through repeated resolution calls, causing unbounded memory growth and OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [State Inconsistency] Since PackageLock has no interior mutability protection, can multiple mutable references lead to race conditions when used in multi-threaded contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [Serialization Order] Does BTreeMap guarantee deterministic serialization order in TOML output, or can non-deterministic ordering cause lock file churn and confusion in version control? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [Missing Validation] The struct has no validation that git commit hashes are valid hex strings or that on_chain versions are reasonable - can invalid data persist in the lock file? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Async Race Condition] Since resolve_git_revision is async and takes &mut self, can concurrent async calls cause data races if multiple tasks resolve different dependencies simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Async Race Condition] Similarly, can concurrent calls to resolve_network_version lead to lost updates or inconsistent state when multiple network requests complete out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Async Cancellation Safety] If the async function is cancelled mid-execution (after insertion but before return), can it leave the lock in an inconsistent state with partial entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Async Cancellation Safety] If cancelled during network request, can partial state updates cause future resolution attempts to fail or use stale data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Send/Sync Safety] Is PackageLock properly Send+Sync for concurrent use across threads, or can sharing it cause undefined behavior in multi-threaded build systems? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Dependency Confusion] Can an attacker register a malicious package with a similar name or URL pattern that gets resolved instead of the legitimate dependency due to URL parsing ambiguities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Typosquatting] Does the git URL validation prevent typosquatting attacks where slightly misspelled repository URLs get resolved and locked, pulling in malicious code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Network Substitution] Can an attacker exploit DNS hijacking or BGP hijacking to redirect fullnode_url requests to malicious servers that provide fake version numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Lock File Tampering] If an attacker gains write access to the lock file on disk, can they inject malicious dependencies that bypass all validation since load_from_file_or_empty doesn't revalidate entries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [Commit Substitution] Can an attacker who compromises a git repository substitute malicious commits at already-locked commit IDs through git history rewriting, bypassing lock protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [URL Validation] Does CanonicalGitIdentity::new() properly validate and sanitize git URLs to prevent injection of malicious protocols (git://, file://, etc.) or credential exposure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Rev Validation] Is there any validation that rev parameter doesn't contain null bytes, newlines, or other control characters that could break parsing or cause injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [URL Scheme Validation] Does CanonicalNodeIdentity::new() restrict fullnode_url to only safe schemes (https://) and prevent dangerous schemes like file://, javascript:, data:? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Port Validation] Can an attacker specify malicious ports in fullnode_url (e.g., port 22 for SSH, port 25 for SMTP) to cause the HTTP client to interact with unintended services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [Path Sanitization] Is the path parameter validated to prevent null bytes, control characters, or extremely long paths that could cause filesystem errors or exploits? (Medium)"
