  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: signature()] [Aggregation Input Validation] When OrderVote signatures are aggregated via BLS signature aggregation, does the aggregation logic validate that all input OrderVotes have the same ledger_info before aggregating, preventing aggregation of votes for different states? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: is_verified()] [Aggregation Verification State] If multiple OrderVotes are aggregated and one has is_verified() == false while others are true, does the aggregation logic properly handle mixed verification states or could unverified signatures contaminate the aggregate? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: signature_with_status()] [Aggregate Signature Status Tracking] When signatures are aggregated, is the verification_status properly merged or could the aggregate signature have incorrect verification status leading to re-verification or bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Unbounded LedgerInfo Size] Can the LedgerInfo field contain unboundedly large data structures (e.g., massive next_epoch_state), and could attackers create OrderVotes that consume excessive memory causing validator OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Signature Size Validation] Is there validation on the bls12381::Signature size to prevent malformed oversized signatures from consuming excessive memory during OrderVote processing? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Expensive Verification DoS] Can Byzantine validators flood honest validators with invalid OrderVotes that fail the cheap consensus_data_hash check but pass it, forcing expensive optimistic_verify() calls and causing CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Type Confusion] Can the Author type on line 19 be confused with other address-like types in unsafe code or through raw pointer manipulation, causing votes to be attributed to wrong validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [Move Semantics] Does new_with_signature() properly consume/move the signature parameter preventing reuse, or could the same signature be used in multiple OrderVotes if passed by reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Lifetime Issues] Are there any lifetime issues with the &LedgerInfo returned by ledger_info() that could cause use-after-free if the OrderVote is dropped while references exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Quorum Certificate Integration] When OrderVotes are aggregated into a Quorum Certificate for ordering, does the QC properly validate that all constituent OrderVotes had consensus_data_hash == HashValue::zero(), or could mixed vote types break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch Boundary Handling] During epoch transitions, can OrderVotes from the old epoch be incorrectly accepted in the new epoch, or new epoch OrderVotes used in the old epoch, causing validator set confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Order Vote vs Commit Vote Confusion] Can OrderVotes be confused with regular consensus Votes (that have non-zero consensus_data_hash) in signature aggregation or vote counting, breaking the separation between ordering and commit protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [State Root Validation] Does the LedgerInfo.state_root in an OrderVote get validated against actual executed state, or could Byzantine validators create OrderVotes with incorrect state roots causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch Arithmetic Overflow] If epoch() is used in arithmetic operations for epoch transitions or comparisons, can integer overflow in epoch calculations cause security issues like accepting far-future or wrapped-around epoch votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Version Number Arithmetic] Can the LedgerInfo.version() used with OrderVotes overflow, and could this cause ordering of blocks at incorrect blockchain heights or allow replaying old blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Verification Performance] Can an attacker submit OrderVotes with valid consensus_data_hash but complex LedgerInfo structures that make optimistic_verify() extremely slow, degrading validator performance and potentially causing liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: new_with_signature()] [OrderVote Construction DoS] Can repeated calls to new_with_signature() with large LedgerInfo objects cause memory pressure or allocation DoS, affecting validator stability during high vote volume? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Timestamp Validation] Does the LedgerInfo in OrderVote contain timestamp information, and is it validated to prevent timestamp manipulation attacks that could affect transaction ordering within blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Ordering Metadata] Does LedgerInfo contain ordering-specific metadata beyond consensus_data_hash, and could manipulation of this metadata affect the determinism of block ordering across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Mempool Integration] When OrderVotes are used to order transactions from mempool, can invalid OrderVotes cause transaction exclusion or inclusion that differs across validators, violating deterministic execution? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [Storage Layer Integration] When OrderVote LedgerInfo is committed to storage, is the consensus_data_hash == zero requirement preserved, or could storage inconsistencies cause non-zero consensus data to appear in committed blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Struct: OrderVote] [Empty Author Address] Can an OrderVote be created with an empty or zero Author address, and would such votes pass verify() allowing anonymous voting that breaks accountability? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: signature()] [Zero Signature] Can an OrderVote have a zero or identity element BLS signature, and would verify() catch this or could zero signatures pass validation and aggregate incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: verify()] [Ensure! Macro Safety] Does the ensure! macro on line 85-88 properly short-circuit and return error without proceeding to optimistic_verify(), or could logic errors cause verification to proceed despite consensus_data_hash mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/order_vote.rs] [Function: ledger_info()] [LedgerInfo Clone] If LedgerInfo is cloned from the OrderVote and modified before being used elsewhere, could this create inconsistencies between the signed LedgerInfo and the working copy? (Medium)"
