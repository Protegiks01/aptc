  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 450] [Unwrap on Join Next] Line 450 uses '.unwrap()' on join_next_with_id() assuming the set is not empty - can rapid task completion create a window where the set is empty, causing a panic that skips all cleanup logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: wait_for_startup() line 182] [Error Context Loss] Errors are wrapped with CliError::UnexpectedError and formatted with {:?} - can this lose critical stack traces or error details needed to diagnose security issues like authentication failures or permission errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 440-441] [Expect on Ctrl-C Registration] If ctrl_c() registration fails with .expect(), the process panics without running shutdown steps - can an attacker exhaust signal handler resources or manipulate signal masks to trigger this panic, leaving containers running and potentially accessible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 286-344] [Unbounded Manager Vector] The managers vector grows without limits based on configuration - can an attacker provide arguments that create excessive managers (e.g., many processors), exhausting memory or file descriptors during concurrent execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: wait_for_startup() line 136-177] [Unbounded Futures Vector] The futures vector is unbounded and all futures execute concurrently - can an attacker craft configuration to create thousands of health checkers, causing resource exhaustion through concurrent HTTP connections or DNS lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 391] [JoinSet Unbounded Growth] The JoinSet grows as managers are spawned - if manager count is not limited, can this cause memory exhaustion or task scheduler overload, degrading performance or causing service failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 259-267] [Log Directory Traversal] The ThreadNameMakeWriter uses test_dir.clone() which may be user-controlled - can an attacker cause logs to be written to sensitive directories by manipulating test_dir, potentially overwriting system files or disclosing paths through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: wait_for_startup() line 155-173] [Sensitive Information in Logs] Health checker endpoints are logged and printed - can this expose sensitive internal URLs, authentication tokens embedded in URLs, or network topology information to attackers with console access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 412] [Error Message Information Disclosure] The error at line 412 prints the full test_dir path - can this disclose sensitive filesystem structure, usernames, or directory layouts to attackers, aiding in subsequent attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: get_derived_test_dir() line 504] [GlobalConfig Deserialization] GlobalConfig::load() may deserialize untrusted data from disk - can an attacker manipulate the config file to inject malicious paths, commands, or cause deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., if using unsafe deserialization)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 241-243] [Prompt Bypass] The prompt_yes_with_override() can be bypassed with prompt_options - can an attacker set automatic yes flags in configuration to bypass the safety check before directory deletion, enabling automated destruction of data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 294] [Faucet Conditional Logic] The faucet is only disabled if no_faucet is true - can an attacker manipulate FaucetArgs to enable the faucet in production-like environments, creating unauthorized token minting capabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 306-310] [PostgresManager Initialization] PostgresManager is created with test_dir which may be attacker-controlled - can this lead to PostgreSQL data directory manipulation, allowing SQL injection preparation or data exfiltration through controlled data directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 317-323] [ProcessorManager Initialization] ProcessorManagers receive node_manager.get_data_service_url() and postgres connection strings - can an attacker exploit TOCTOU issues where these URLs change between retrieval and use, causing processors to connect to malicious endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 336-343] [IndexerApiManager Connection String] The postgres connection string is passed without validation - can an attacker inject connection parameters (e.g., sslmode=disable, options=-c) to downgrade security or execute arbitrary SQL through connection options? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: wait_for_startup() line 159-176] [Async Block Capture] The async block captures health_checker by move - if health_checker contains Arc/Mutex locks, can this create deadlocks or lock ordering issues when multiple futures execute concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 403-419] [Tokio Select Bias] The tokio::select! may have implicit ordering bias - if wait_for_startup() completes at the same time as a service crash, which branch is taken? Can this create non-deterministic behavior in error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 438] [Async Spawn Without Abort Handle Management] The abort_handle is created but only its ID is used - can memory leaks occur if the spawned ctrl-c task is not properly cleaned up, especially if shutdown is interrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 312-316] [Processor Prerequisite Collection] Prerequisite health checkers are flattened from node and postgres - can an attacker manipulate the order or duplicate entries to cause processors to start with incomplete dependencies, leading to data corruption in indexed data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 325-334] [Processor Manager Collection] Multiple processor managers are collected and their health checkers are flattened - if processor health checks don't properly isolate state, can one processor's failure affect others, creating cascading failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 346-348] [Node Manager Timing] NodeManager is pushed to managers last for access convenience - can this ordering create issues where node-specific cleanup doesn't happen first during shutdown, leaving the node in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 274-283] [Bind Address Auto-Detection] The code checks .dockerenv to decide between 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1 - can an attacker create a fake .dockerenv file in the working directory to force binding to 0.0.0.0 in non-container environments, exposing services publicly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 380-383] [Ready Server Endpoint Disclosure] The readiness endpoint is printed with the bind address - can an attacker use this information disclosure to scan for running testnets on 0.0.0.0 bindings, enabling unauthorized access to faucets or APIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 289-301] [NodeManager Bind Address] NodeManager receives bind_to which could be 0.0.0.0 - can this expose the node API on all interfaces, allowing remote attackers to submit malicious transactions or query sensitive blockchain state without authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/mod.rs] [Function: execute() line 295-303] [FaucetManager Bind Address] FaucetManager binds to the discovered bind_to address - if this is 0.0.0.0, can remote attackers drain faucet funds by sending unlimited requests, or manipulate accounts through publicly accessible faucet APIs?
