  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error handling] Does the ? operator at line 15 properly propagate all error types from WorkspaceCommand::run(), or could certain error variants be silently converted/lost during error propagation, potentially hiding critical failures in service startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error information disclosure] When self.run().await? fails, does the error propagation leak sensitive information about the local development environment (file paths, port numbers, database credentials) to untrusted CLI users? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error recovery] If WorkspaceCommand::run() fails after partial service initialization, does the execute() method ensure proper cleanup of resources (Docker containers, temp directories, network sockets), or can failed executions leave orphaned processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async safety] Is the async execute() method cancellation-safe? If the future is dropped mid-execution (e.g., CLI process killed), can this leave services running indefinitely or corrupt shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic safety] If WorkspaceCommand::run() panics during execution, does the async runtime properly unwind and clean up resources, or can panics cause resource leaks in long-running CLI processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Concurrent execution] Can multiple instances of execute() be called concurrently on the same or different WorkspaceCommand instances? Could this lead to port conflicts, Docker network name collisions, or race conditions in service initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Trait: CliCommand<()>] [Type safety] Does the CliCommand<()> trait implementation correctly handle the () return type in all cases, or could mismatches between execute()'s CliTypedResult<()> and the trait contract cause type coercion issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: command_name()] [Static lifetime] Is returning a &'static str from command_name() safe in all contexts? Could a caller attempt to free or modify this string, potentially causing undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Trait: async_trait] [Macro safety] Does the #[async_trait] macro expansion introduce any hidden allocations, boxing, or trait object conversions that could cause performance issues or unexpected behavior in CLI execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Missing validation] Does execute() perform any validation on the WorkspaceCommand instance before delegating to self.run(), or can malformed/malicious command parameters bypass validation and reach service initialization code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Privilege escalation] If WorkspaceCommand contains user-controlled parameters (e.g., timeout values, port numbers), can a local attacker craft inputs that cause execute() to spawn services with elevated privileges or access restricted resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Input sanitization] Does the delegation pattern ensure that WorkspaceCommand parameters are sanitized before being passed to Docker commands, PostgreSQL connections, or system calls in the underlying implementation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call execute() to spawn unlimited workspace instances, exhausting system resources (ports, Docker containers, disk space) and causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Cleanup on drop] If the CliCommand implementation is dropped before execute() completes, does it ensure graceful shutdown of spawned services, or can abrupt termination leave zombie processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Execution context] Does execute() validate the security context (user permissions, working directory, environment variables) before delegating to self.run()? Can a local attacker manipulate the environment to compromise service startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Credential handling] If WorkspaceCommand contains or accesses credentials (API keys, database passwords), does the wrapper ensure these are not logged, exposed in error messages, or leaked through debug output? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Reentrancy] Can execute() be called multiple times on the same WorkspaceCommand instance? Could this lead to double-initialization of services, port conflicts, or state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [State mutation] Does WorkspaceCommand maintain any mutable state that execute() modifies? Could concurrent or repeated calls cause race conditions or state inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error type conversion] When converting errors from self.run() to CliTypedResult<()>, are all error variants properly mapped, or could certain error types be misrepresented, making debugging harder? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic propagation] If self.run() panics instead of returning an error, does the async trait implementation catch and convert it to a proper error, or will it propagate as an uncaught panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Timeout handling] Does the CliCommand implementation impose any timeout on execute()? Can a malicious or buggy WorkspaceCommand::run() hang indefinitely, blocking the CLI and preventing resource cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Function: execute()] [Graceful shutdown] If the user sends a termination signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM) while execute() is running, does it ensure all spawned services are gracefully stopped before exiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/workspace/mod.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply chain] Does the module properly constrain versions of imported dependencies (CliCommand, CliTypedResult, WorkspaceCommand, async_trait)? Could a malicious dependency update introduce vulnerabilities in the trait implementation? (Low)"
