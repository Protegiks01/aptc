  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_tables.rs] [Function: from_write_table_item()] [Version ordering] If transactions are indexed out of order, can newer CurrentTableItem entries be overwritten by older TableItem data, causing the indexed state to regress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_tables.rs] [Struct: CurrentTableItem] [Type confusion] The decoded_key and decoded_value fields are serde_json::Value - can attacker insert malformed JSON that gets deserialized as wrong types, causing type confusion in applications querying indexed data? (Medium)",
