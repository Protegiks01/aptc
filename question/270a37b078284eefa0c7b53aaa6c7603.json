  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db.rs] [Constant: INDEX_DB_NAME] [Path Traversal] If INDEX_DB_NAME='index_indexer_db' is used unsanitized in filesystem operations elsewhere, could an attacker manipulate the database path through symbolic links or path traversal to corrupt other database files or gain unauthorized access to storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db.rs] [Constant: INDEX_DB_NAME] [Database Collision] Could the hardcoded database name 'index_indexer_db' collide with other database directories in the storage system, leading to data corruption or mixing of indexer data with critical consensus/state data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db.rs] [Constant: INDEX_DB_NAME] [Immutability] Is there a security risk if the constant INDEX_DB_NAME is ever changed in a protocol upgrade, potentially causing existing nodes to lose access to historical indexer data or create database inconsistencies during migration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer/src/db.rs] [Constant: INDEX_DB_NAME] [File System Security] Does the string 'index_indexer_db' contain any special characters that could be exploited in filesystem operations on different operating systems (Windows/Linux/macOS) when used as a directory name? (Low)"
