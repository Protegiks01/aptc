  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature Bypass] Can an attacker craft a malicious EpochChangeProof with empty or invalid aggregated signatures that passes verification due to insufficient signature validation in the loop at lines 80-116, allowing unauthorized epoch transitions and potential validator set takeover? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Consensus Safety Violation] Does the verification loop properly ensure contiguous epoch numbers between consecutive LedgerInfoWithSignatures entries, or can an attacker insert non-contiguous epoch jumps to skip validator set changes and maintain control over consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Byzantine Attack] Can a Byzantine validator coalition (< 1/3) exploit the skip_while logic at lines 103-105 to force verification to skip all honest ledger infos and accept only malicious entries, causing a chain split? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [State Inconsistency] When verifier_ref is updated at line 112-115, can race conditions in concurrent verify() calls with shared verifier state lead to inconsistent epoch state across validators, causing network partition?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator Set Manipulation] Does next_epoch_state() extraction at lines 112-115 properly validate that the new validator set is legitimately voted upon, or can an attacker inject a malicious validator set through crafted LedgerInfo to gain consensus control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay old but valid EpochChangeProof entries from previous epochs to roll back the validator set to a compromised state where they control > 2/3 of validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Between checking is_ledger_info_stale() at line 73-77 and the actual verification loop at lines 80-116, can an attacker exploit timing windows to inject stale proofs that become valid after the initial check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker craft an EpochChangeProof with all entries marked as stale by skip_while at line 103, causing the verification to succeed with an empty iteration and returning potentially unsafe state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Quorum Certificate Forgery] Does verifier_ref.verify() at line 108 properly check BLS signature aggregation math to prevent quorum certificate forgery, or can an attacker with < threshold signatures fool the aggregation verification?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Epoch Monotonicity] Does the verification enforce strict epoch monotonicity (epoch_n+1 > epoch_n), or can an attacker provide equal epochs or backwards epoch numbers to cause state confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator Verifier Mutability] Since verifier_ref is reassigned in the loop at line 112, can an attacker exploit mutable reference semantics to cause use-after-free or double-verification issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Stale Check Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the is_ledger_info_stale() implementation to return false for genuinely stale entries, allowing old epoch proofs to override newer trusted state? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/epoch_change.rs] [Function: verify()] [Last Entry Validation] Does returning last().unwrap() at line 118 ensure that the last entry was actually verified in the loop, or could all entries be skipped leaving an unverified entry as the return value? (Critical)",
