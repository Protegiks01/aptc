  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Struct: IncomingRpcRequest] [Authentication bypass] Can a malicious peer send RPC requests without proper authentication, exploiting the fact that IncomingRpcRequest only validates sender as AccountAddress without cryptographic signature verification on the message itself? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Struct: IncomingRpcRequest] [Message replay] Does IncomingRpcRequest implement replay protection, or can an attacker capture and replay old DKGMessage requests to force validators to re-process stale DKG transcripts from previous epochs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Struct: IncomingRpcRequest] [Type confusion] Can an attacker send IncomingRpcRequest with mismatched msg and response_sender types, causing the response_sender to serialize incorrect data when processing TranscriptRequest vs TranscriptResponse messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Struct: IncomingRpcRequest] [Response hijacking] Is there validation that the response_sender corresponds to the actual sender peer, or can an attacker inject a malicious response_sender to intercept DKG transcript responses meant for other validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Struct: IncomingRpcRequest] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker flood IncomingRpcRequest messages with large DKGMessage payloads to exhaust memory before the rpc_tx channel back-pressure is applied, causing validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::new()] [Identity spoofing] Does new() validate that the author AccountAddress matches the actual validator identity in dkg_network_client, or can an attacker construct a NetworkSender with a forged author to impersonate other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::new()] [Channel ownership] Can multiple NetworkSender instances share the same self_sender channel, allowing concurrent sends that could race and corrupt the self-messaging state or deliver messages out of order? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::new()] [Clone safety] Since NetworkSender implements Clone, can an attacker clone the sender multiple times and use clones to bypass rate limiting or flood self-messages through the self_sender channel? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Self-send bypass] In the self-sending path (lines 69-80), can a malicious validator exploit the lack of authentication to send forged DKG messages to themselves, bypassing network-level signature validation that would apply to normal RPC calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Protocol confusion] The self-send path uses RPC[0] hardcoded protocol (line 71), but what if the dkg_network_client expects a different protocol version? Can this cause deserialization failures or protocol downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Timeout bypass] Can an attacker set an extremely long timeout_duration to hold resources indefinitely, or a zero/negative duration to cause timeout checks to fail and allow synchronous blocking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Race condition] Between lines 73-74, there's a window where self_msg is sent and rx is awaited - can a malicious actor exploit this race to send multiple concurrent self-RPCs that interleave and corrupt the oneshot channel state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Response spoofing] The oneshot receiver rx (line 74) is not cryptographically bound to the request - can an attacker intercept and inject a malicious response into the oneshot channel before the legitimate response arrives? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Error handling leak] Line 79 returns 'self rpc failed' without distinguishing timeout vs channel errors - can this leak information about internal validator state or allow an attacker to cause silent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Deserialize panic] Line 76 spawns blocking deserialization with protocol.from_bytes() - can a malicious message cause panic in spawn_blocking that crashes the entire tokio runtime and halts DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Double await] Line 74 awaits timeout(rx) which returns Ok(Ok(Ok(bytes))) - can malformed responses cause the nested Result unwrapping to panic or bypass error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Channel overflow] Does self_sender have bounded capacity? Can an attacker trigger self-RPC floods that overflow the channel and cause message loss or validator deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Peer validation] Line 69 checks receiver == self.author() - but what if the receiver address is forged or the equality check is bypassed through type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: NetworkSender::send_rpc()] [Response injection] The self-send path clones msg (line 72) - can modifications to the cloned message after sending but before receiving cause inconsistencies in DKG transcript processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Raw bytes injection] Can an attacker send malformed raw_message bytes (lines 92-102) that deserialize into valid but malicious DKGMessage objects, bypassing type safety checks that would apply to send_rb_rpc()? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Protocol mismatch] send_rb_rpc_raw() directly forwards to dkg_network_client without validation - can this allow protocol version confusion attacks between RPC protocols (Compressed/Bcs/Json)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Self-send exclusion] send_rb_rpc() (lines 104-111) always calls self.send_rpc(), but send_rpc has special self-send handling - does reliable broadcast properly handle self-messages in DKG transcript aggregation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Timeout inconsistency] Can different timeout values between send_rb_rpc() and send_rpc() cause reliable broadcast to fail partway through, leaving some validators with transcripts and others without? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization bomb] Can an attacker craft a DKGMessage (line 118) that serializes to extremely large bytes for some peers but not others, causing memory exhaustion selectively to partition the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/network.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Peer list manipulation] Does to_bytes_by_protocol() validate that all peers in the Vec are authorized validators, or can an attacker include non-validator addresses to leak DKG transcripts? (Critical)"
