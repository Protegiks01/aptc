  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/verification/mod.rs] [Function: should_remove_node()] [Silent Failures] Does the filtering process add diagnostics to CompilationEnv when it removes verify_only code, or does it fail silently potentially masking security-critical filtering errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/verification/mod.rs] [Function: verification_attributes()] [Invalid Attributes] What happens when an attribute claims to be verification-related but has invalid syntax - does it get filtered or cause a compilation error? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/verification/mod.rs] [Function: program()] [Propagated Errors] If attribute parsing fails in verification_attributes, are errors properly propagated to the caller or swallowed by the filter_map? (Medium)",
