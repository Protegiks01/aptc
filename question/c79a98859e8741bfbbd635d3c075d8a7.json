  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Multisig Address Collision] For multisig accounts, does create_multisig_account_address with sequence_number 0 properly prevent address collisions, or can an attacker find a standard account that collides with a future multisig account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Hex Validation Bypass] Can an attacker provide a vanity prefix with mixed uppercase/lowercase that passes hex validation but causes case-sensitive comparison issues in short_str_lossless(), finding unintended addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Side Channel] Does the infinite loop's timing leak information about how close the current attempt is to matching the prefix, allowing attackers to infer private key material through timing analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [Odd-Length Prefix] When a prefix has odd length and a '0' is appended for hex validation, does the actual matching logic properly use the original odd-length prefix, or does it incorrectly match the padded version? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: generate_vanity_account_ed25519()] [0x Prefix Handling] Does stripping the '0x' prefix properly handle edge cases like '0x0x' or 'x' that might bypass validation but cause unexpected behavior in downstream address matching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: current_dir()] [Directory Traversal] Can an attacker change the process's current directory mid-execution to redirect file operations to attacker-controlled locations, compromising validator key storage or configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: dir_default_to_current()] [TOCTOU Race] If maybe_dir is None and current_dir() is called, can an attacker change the working directory between this check and subsequent file operations, redirecting writes to unintended locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: create_dir_if_not_exist()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Between checking dir.exists() and calling create_dir_all(), can an attacker create a symlink at that path pointing to a critical system directory, causing the CLI to modify system file permissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: create_dir_if_not_exist()] [Directory Traversal] Does the function validate that the dir path doesn't contain ../ sequences before creation, preventing attackers from creating directories outside intended boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: create_dir_if_not_exist()] [Permission Issues] Does create_dir_all() create intermediate directories with secure permissions, or can they be world-readable, exposing validator configuration or key material to local attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: create_dir_if_not_exist()] [Logic Error] What happens if the path exists but is a file (not a directory)? Does the !dir.is_dir() check properly catch this before attempting create_dir_all(), or can it fail unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_line()] [Buffer Overflow] Does read_line() properly handle extremely long input lines, or can an attacker flood stdin with gigabytes of data without newlines, causing OOM and crashing the CLI during sensitive operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_line()] [Control Character Injection] Can an attacker inject control characters, null bytes, or ANSI escape sequences through stdin that corrupt subsequent parsing or logging, potentially hiding malicious operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_line()] [Unicode Exploitation] Does the function properly handle invalid UTF-8 sequences in input, or can malformed Unicode cause panics or unexpected behavior in downstream string processing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_dir_files()] [Directory Traversal] Does the predicate function properly validate that returned paths don't escape the parent directory through symlinks, potentially leaking files from restricted locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_dir_files()] [Symlink Following] Can an attacker place symlinks in the directory that point to sensitive files (like validator keys), causing them to be read and potentially exposed through the predicate function's logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_dir_files()] [Resource Exhaustion] If the directory contains millions of files, does the function accumulate all matching paths in memory without bounds, causing OOM crashes during directory scanning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: read_dir_files()] [Race Condition] Can files be added or removed from the directory while it's being scanned, causing inconsistent results or missing critical files during operations like key material discovery? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: fund_account()] [Faucet Abuse] Can an attacker flood the faucet with funding requests for the same or different addresses, draining the faucet and preventing legitimate users from obtaining testnet funds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: fund_account()] [Authentication Bypass] If faucet_auth_token is None, does the faucet properly rate-limit or validate requests, or can attackers make unlimited funding requests without authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: fund_account()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker front-run the funding transaction by monitoring the mempool, stealing funds before they reach the intended recipient address? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: fund_account()] [Amount Manipulation] Is num_octas properly validated to prevent overflow or extremely large values that could drain the faucet or cause integer overflow in account balance calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: wait_for_transactions()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate SystemTime to extend the timeout calculation, causing the function to wait longer than intended and potentially missing transaction failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: wait_for_transactions()] [Integer Overflow] If the system time is somehow set to a value near u64::MAX, can the addition of +30 seconds cause an overflow, resulting in a timeout in the past that causes immediate failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/common/utils.rs] [Function: wait_for_transactions()] [Transaction Censorship] Does the function detect if transactions are being censored by validators, or does it silently timeout and fail, potentially hiding network attacks or validator misbehavior? (Medium)"
