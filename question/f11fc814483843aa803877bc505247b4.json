  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Module Visibility] Are all sub-modules correctly marked as pub(crate), or could improper visibility (line 5-13) expose internal consensus liveness components to external crates, allowing unauthorized access to proposer election or round state logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Module Structure] Does the module structure properly isolate different proposer election implementations (cached_proposer_election, rotating_proposer_election, unequivocal_proposer_election on lines 5, 10, 13), or could naming conflicts or improper re-exports lead to consensus using the wrong election algorithm? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Test Module Exposure] Are test modules (lines 15-26) properly gated with #[cfg(test)], ensuring test-only code cannot be accessed in production builds where it might expose internal state or bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Dependency Chain] Does the pub(crate) visibility (lines 5-13) properly restrict access from the parent consensus module, or could the liveness module's internal components be accessed by untrusted code paths through improper re-exports in lib.rs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Module Isolation] Are the multiple proposer election implementations (lines 5, 10, 11, 13) properly isolated to prevent accidental cross-contamination, or could a bug in module resolution cause the wrong proposer election algorithm to be instantiated at runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Missing Safety Checks] Does the module declaration file lack any safety-critical validation or initialization code that should be performed when the liveness module is loaded, potentially allowing the consensus layer to operate with uninitialized or invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Compilation Security] Could conditional compilation of test modules (lines 15-26) introduce security vulnerabilities if test feature flags are accidentally enabled in production, exposing mock implementations or test-only backdoors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/liveness/mod.rs] [Module Ordering] Does the declaration order of sub-modules (lines 5-13) affect initialization or dependency resolution in a way that could cause race conditions or use-before-initialization bugs in the consensus liveness layer? (Low)"
