(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/random.rs] [Function: unsafe_random_points_slow()] [Scalar lifetime] The scalar sampled at line 27 in unsafe_random_point_slow - is this properly zeroed after multiplication at line 29, or can it persist in memory allowing attackers to recover discrete logs?
