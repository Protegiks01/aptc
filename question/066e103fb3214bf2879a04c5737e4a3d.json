  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Serialization errors] If to_bytes_by_protocol() fails for some peers, does send_rb_rpc_raw() skip those peers or abort entirely - can partial failures break reliable broadcast? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitVote] [LedgerInfo manipulation] Can attacker craft CommitVote with valid signature but manipulated LedgerInfo fields (consensus_data_hash, timestamp) to cause state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitVote] [Round manipulation] Can CommitVote.round() return manipulated round numbers that cause votes to be applied to wrong consensus rounds breaking safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitVote] [Signature reuse] Can signature from one CommitVote be extracted and attached to different LedgerInfo, creating forged votes if signature verification doesn't bind message content? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitDecision] [Quorum manipulation] Can attacker create CommitDecision with exactly 2f+1 signatures but include signatures from wrong validators not in current validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitDecision] [Signature aggregation] Are CommitDecision signatures properly aggregated using secure BLS aggregation, or can attacker forge aggregated signature without collecting individual signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitDecision] [Decision finality] Once CommitDecision is broadcast and acked, can it be reverted or overridden by later CommitDecision for same epoch/round causing safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Connection limit] Can attacker force validator to send_rb_rpc() to many Byzantine peers simultaneously, exhausting connection pool and preventing communication with honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Memory amplification] If CommitDecision contains signatures from all validators in large validator set (100+), can serialization consume excessive memory causing OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Memory leak] If broadcast never completes due to missing acks, does AckState remain allocated forever causing memory leak over many failed broadcasts? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Integration: consensus pipeline] [Pipeline ordering] Can CommitVote/CommitDecision messages arrive before corresponding execution completes, causing validators to commit blocks before verifying execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Integration: consensus pipeline] [Pipeline bypass] Can attacker send CommitDecision directly without going through voting phase, bypassing execution and proposal validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Integration: buffer manager] [Buffer overflow] If commit messages arrive faster than they can be processed, can message buffers overflow causing message loss and consensus stalls? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Weak randomness] Does signature verification use cryptographically secure randomness, or can predictable randomness enable signature forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: CommitMessage::verify()] [Hash collision] Can attacker find hash collision in LedgerInfo hash causing two different commits to have same hash, breaking state commitment? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Type: CommitVote] [Key reuse] If validator key is reused across epochs without rotation, can old CommitVote signatures be replayed in new epochs? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: state consistency] [Split brain] Can network partition cause some validators to commit based on CommitDecision while others reject it, creating blockchain fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: state consistency] [Commit divergence] Can validators commit different blocks at same height if they receive different CommitDecisions due to Byzantine broadcast manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Overall: state consistency] [Rollback attack] After CommitDecision is finalized, can attacker cause validators to rollback committed state by sending conflicting Votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Premature completion] If validators HashSet accidentally becomes empty (due to bug/race), does add() return Some(()) allowing broadcast to complete without any acks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Validator removal] Can validator set changes during broadcast cause validators to be removed from AckState.validators, preventing broadcast from ever completing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: BroadcastStatus::add()] [Double ack] If same peer sends Ack twice and add() is called twice, does second call return 'Unknown author' error or does it silently succeed? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Struct: AckState] [Ack threshold] Does protocol require ALL validators to ack or only 2f+1 quorum - can Byzantine validators refusing to ack cause permanent liveness failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc()] [Nack escalation] Can Byzantine validators strategically send Nack for some messages but Ack for others, causing inconsistent retry behavior across validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/pipeline/commit_reliable_broadcast.rs] [Function: send_rb_rpc_raw()] [Nack without reason] CommitMessage::Nack contains no error reason - can this lead to infinite retry loops if underlying issue is permanent? (Medium)"
