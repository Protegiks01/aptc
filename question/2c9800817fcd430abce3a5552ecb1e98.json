  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [No timeout enforcement] Does simple_msg_exchange() at lines 92-118 implement request timeouts, or can Byzantine shards deliberately delay responses indefinitely to cause coordinator deadlocks affecting consensus liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Function: call()] [Slow loris attack] Can attackers send execution requests that take excessive time to process, exploiting the lack of timeouts in call() at lines 210-277 to hold server resources and prevent other requests from being handled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Function: simple_msg_exchange()] [Response integrity] Does the coordinator validate that Empty responses from simple_msg_exchange() at lines 92-118 actually correspond to successful execution, or can corrupted shards return Empty for failed executions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Function: call() - response] [Response tampering] Can responses generated in call() at lines 244-258 be tampered with before reaching the coordinator, potentially modifying execution results or injecting malicious data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Type: Grpc<T>] [Channel reuse vulnerability] Can the underlying Grpc<T> channel reused across multiple requests in the client at line 34 lead to request mixing, where data from one execution request leaks into another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Type: Grpc<T>] [Channel hijacking] Can Byzantine validators hijack established gRPC channels to inject malicious requests or intercept responses, exploiting weaknesses in channel security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Module: Generated code] [Protocol version skew] Can mismatches between coordinator and shard protocol versions (where coordinators use updated .tonic.rs and shards use old versions) cause execution divergence or security vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Module: Generated code] [Breaking changes in regeneration] If this auto-generated file (line 4: @generated) is regenerated with different protobuf compiler versions, can breaking changes introduce security vulnerabilities in deployed systems?

  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Type: BoxFuture] [Stack overflow via deep nesting] Can deeply nested async operations create extremely large BoxFuture chains that cause stack overflows when polled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.remote_executor.v1.tonic.rs] [Function: connect()] [Service endpoint poisoning] Can Byzantine validators provide poisoned service endpoints to connect() at lines 17-24 that redirect execution requests to attacker-controlled services, enabling execution hijacking attacks? (Critical)",
