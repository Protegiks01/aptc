  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Indexer availability] Can resource exhaustion attacks targeting new_db_pool() or get_chunks() cause indexer service disruption, preventing dApps from querying blockchain state and indirectly affecting network usability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Function: execute_with_better_error] [Transaction isolation] Does the function properly set transaction isolation levels, or can concurrent upserts at different isolation levels cause phantom reads or lost updates in the indexed data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Function: execute_with_better_error] [Connection pooling] Can connection state from previous queries (temp tables, prepared statements, session variables) leak between pooled connections, causing unexpected behavior in subsequent indexing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Integration: Diesel + PostgreSQL] [Extension exploitation] Can malicious SQL injected through where_clause exploit PostgreSQL extensions or functions to achieve code execution or privilege escalation on the database server? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Function: get_chunks] [Algorithmic complexity] The while loop at lines 36-42 has O(n/max_item_size) complexity - can attackers provide parameters causing excessive iterations, creating CPU-based DoS against the indexer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Function: clean_data_for_db] [Processing time] The map operation at line 53 processes each item individually - can extremely large items or deeply nested structures cause excessive CPU usage during serialization/deserialization cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Function: execute_with_better_error] [Query complexity] Can complex queries with large where_clause values cause excessive query planning time in PostgreSQL, creating a performance bottleneck for the indexer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Dependency: diesel] [ORM vulnerabilities] Can vulnerabilities in the diesel ORM crate (used throughout this file) be exploited to bypass query parameterization or prepared statement security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Dependency: r2d2] [Connection pool bugs] Can bugs in the r2d2 connection pooling library cause connection leaks or pool corruption, leading to indexer service degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Code quality] [Unsafe allowances] The file has #![allow(clippy::extra_unused_lifetimes)] at line 5 - can this hide legitimate lifetime issues that could lead to use-after-free or other memory safety bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/database.rs] [Code quality] [Generic constraints] The generic type T in clean_data_for_db() and UpsertFilterLatestTransactionQuery lacks comprehensive bounds - can this allow types that violate safety assumptions to be used? (Low)"
