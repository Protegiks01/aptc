  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Non-deterministic optimization] If skip_config_optimizer is false, could non-deterministic optimizer behavior cause validators to have slightly different configs, leading to consensus timing variations or view changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Validation non-determinism] Could different validators getting different sanitization results (based on timing or external factors) when skip_config_sanitizer=false lead to inconsistent network behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Byzantine toolkit] Do these skip flags effectively provide a 'Byzantine behavior toolkit' for malicious validators, allowing them to systematically disable each security layer and test which attacks become possible? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Attack surface expansion] Does the existence of these flags expand the attack surface by creating multiple code paths (with/without optimization, with/without sanitization) that may have different bugs or vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Emergency recovery] In an emergency scenario where nodes need to skip checks to rapidly restart after a network-wide incident, could attackers exploit the confusion to inject malicious configs with skip flags enabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Disaster recovery] If disaster recovery procedures recommend temporarily setting skip_config_sanitizer=true to bypass strict validation, could this create a window of vulnerability where compromised validators can rejoin with malicious configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Forward compatibility] If future versions add new mandatory security checks to the optimizer or sanitizer, will nodes with skip flags set to true be able to bypass these new checks, creating a permanent security debt? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Backward compatibility] Could older node versions that don't recognize these skip flags default to unsafe behavior when parsing newer config files, creating upgrade-related security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Audit trail bypass] Can setting these skip flags to true cause security-relevant configuration decisions to not be logged or audited, making it harder to detect and investigate security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Compliance violation] Do these flags allow node operators to run configurations that violate Aptos network policies or governance decisions about mandatory security features? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Test config leakage] Could test or staging configs with skip_config_sanitizer=true accidentally be deployed to production mainnet validators, disabling critical security checks in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Dev environment escape] If development configurations routinely use these skip flags for convenience, could there be CI/CD pipeline bugs that deploy dev configs to production environments? (High)"
