  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Global] [Deserialize_from_string] The custom deserializer for BigDecimal string parsing - does it handle scientific notation (e.g., '1e18'), hex notation (e.g., '0x1000'), or other numeric formats that could cause parsing inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_resource] [Resource data null check] Before calling resource.data.as_ref().unwrap(), is there validation that resource.data is Some, or will this panic on malformed resources with None data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: StakePoolResource] [Operator address change] If operator_address changes multiple times in quick succession, does the indexer properly track all changes or could intermediate states be lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: StakePoolResource] [Delegated voter validation] Is delegated_voter required to be different from operator_address, or could self-delegation create governance manipulation opportunities that the indexer doesn't flag? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_table_item_type] [Return type semantics] The function returns Result<Option<Self>> - can the Ok(None) case be confused with successful parsing that found no matching type versus a parsing error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: PoolResource] [Share price calculation] If total_shares is updated before total_coins in on-chain state changes, could the indexer capture an inconsistent snapshot showing incorrect share prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Global] [Serde version dependency] Are there known CVEs in the serde or serde_json versions used that could allow deserialization attacks leading to RCE in the indexer process? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: GovernanceVoteEvent] [Voting power overflow] If num_votes exceeds the total supply of APT tokens, does the indexer flag this as anomalous or silently accept impossible voting power? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_event] [Event version compatibility] If the on-chain Move contracts upgrade event structures (adding/removing fields), will older indexer code using these structs fail gracefully or corrupt data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: UnlockStakeEvent] [Amount validation] Can amount_unlocked exceed the delegator's actual staked balance, and would the indexer detect this inconsistency or show negative balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: WithdrawStakeEvent] [Withdrawal timing] If WithdrawStakeEvent occurs before the lockup period ends on-chain (due to a bug), does the indexer validate withdrawal timing or trust event data blindly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: ReactivateStakeEvent] [Reactivation limits] Can amount_reactivated exceed previously unlocked amounts, and would this create false impressions of stake pool sizes in the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_write_resource] [Module name validation] Are module and name fields in WriteResource validated against allowed character sets, or could module names with special characters bypass type matching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Global] [Clone performance] If PoolResource or DelegationPoolResource objects are large, does excessive cloning during indexer processing cause performance degradation or memory pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: SharesInnerResource] [Table handle validation] Is the Table handle in inner validated to ensure it points to valid on-chain data, or could stale/deleted table handles cause indexer errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: is_resource_supported] [Hardcoded type list] The function only recognizes two specific Move type paths - if Aptos adds new staking mechanisms (e.g., liquid staking, restaking), will they be invisible to the indexer until code updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Enum: StakeResource] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] When downstream code matches on StakeResource variants, are all match arms exhaustive, or could adding a third variant cause compiler errors or runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: DelegationPoolResource] [Commission percentage precision] Is operator_commission_percentage stored with sufficient precision to avoid rounding errors when calculating commissions on large reward amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Global] [Error context verbosity] Error messages include full data dumps (lines 108, 138, 206) - could extremely large data payloads cause log flooding or disk exhaustion when many parse errors occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_table_item_type] [Data cloning cost] Line 103 clones the entire data JSON value - if data is megabytes in size, could this cause memory spikes during bulk indexing operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_resource] [Data cloning cost] Lines 130 and 132 clone data - similar concern about memory usage when processing large resource updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Function: from_event] [Data cloning cost] Lines 190-200 all clone event data - could repeated cloning during event-heavy blocks cause indexer slowdown? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: PoolResource] [BigDecimal arithmetic safety] Do BigDecimal operations on total_coins and total_shares check for overflow, underflow, or loss of precision during indexer calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Global] [Timestamp handling] None of the structs include timestamp fields - could the indexer lose critical timing information about when stake events occurred, making it impossible to audit stake changes over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/stake_utils.rs] [Struct: GovernanceVoteEvent] [Proposal ID uniqueness] If proposal_id wraps around after reaching u64::MAX, could historical votes be incorrectly associated with new proposals having recycled IDs? (Low)"
