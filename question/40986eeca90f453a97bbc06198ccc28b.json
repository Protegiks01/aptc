  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Structure] Does the #![cfg(test)] attribute properly isolate test code from production builds, preventing accidental inclusion of test-only code paths that could expose security vulnerabilities in production Move VM deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Declaration] Can the 'mod compiler;' declaration expose internal compilation utilities to test code in ways that could be exploited to bypass Move VM bytecode verification in production environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Declaration] Can the 'mod tests;' declaration inadvertently export test-only helper functions that could be used to manipulate Move VM state in unintended ways if test code is mistakenly compiled into production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Test Isolation] Does the module structure ensure that test utilities in the compiler module cannot be accessed outside of test builds, preventing potential abuse of unmetered gas or bypassing safety checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Build Configuration] Could conditional compilation flags be manipulated to include this test crate in production builds, exposing test-only attack surfaces in deployed Move VMs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Module Visibility] Does the public API surface of this lib.rs file properly restrict visibility of test infrastructure to prevent external crates from accessing Move VM internals through test utilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Dependency Management] Can the module declarations create circular dependencies or expose internal Move VM implementation details that should remain encapsulated for security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/integration-tests/src/lib.rs] [Test Configuration] Does the #![cfg(test)] attribute cover all test-specific functionality, or could some test utilities leak into non-test builds and create unexpected behavior in production Move VM execution? (Medium)"
