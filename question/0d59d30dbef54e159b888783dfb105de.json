  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious path parameter that traverses outside the intended project directory through reroot_path(), potentially accessing or disassembling sensitive bytecode from other parts of the filesystem? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Input Validation] Does the module_or_script_name parameter undergo proper sanitization before being used in package.get_module_by_name() and package.get_script_by_name(), or can injection attacks occur through special characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a package path pointing to an extremely large or deeply nested package structure that causes excessive memory consumption during config.compile_package(), leading to local denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Information Disclosure] Does the error message on lines 52-56 leak sensitive information about the package structure, module names, or file system paths that could aid in reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Unsafe Unwrap] The unwrap_or() call on line 39 defaults to the package name, but does package.compiled_package_info.package_name guarantee non-empty strings, or could this lead to unexpected behavior with empty package names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Symlink Attack] When reroot_path() resolves the path parameter, does it properly handle symbolic links that could redirect to unintended directories containing malicious Move bytecode? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] Between the compilation at line 36 and the module lookup at lines 40-50, could another process modify the compiled package on disk, causing time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Malicious Bytecode] When processing the compiled unit at line 77 with Disassembler::from_unit(), does the disassembler properly validate bytecode integrity, or could crafted malicious bytecode cause crashes, infinite loops, or arbitrary code execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Interactive Mode Security] The interactive bytecode viewer launched at lines 69-73 with move_bytecode_viewer::start_viewer_in_memory() processes untrusted bytecode - does it have proper sandboxing to prevent malicious bytecode from escaping the viewer context? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Clone Safety] The module.clone() and source_map.clone() operations at lines 70-71 duplicate potentially large data structures - could this cause memory exhaustion with deliberately oversized compiled modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Script Fallback Logic] The fallback chain at lines 42-49 tries multiple name resolution strategies - could an attacker craft module names that exploit the pseudo_script_name_builder() logic to access unintended scripts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Package Name Injection] The needle_package variable at lines 37-39 uses either user-supplied package_name or the default package name - can special characters or path separators in package names be exploited to access modules from other packages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Handling] The or_else() error handling chain at lines 42-50 silently attempts multiple resolution strategies - could this mask legitimate errors and lead to disassembling the wrong module without user awareness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [BuildConfig Trust] The BuildConfig parameter is passed directly to compile_package() - does it properly validate compiler settings, or could malicious build configurations inject unsafe compilation flags? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Source Path Safety] The source_path variable at line 72 is passed to the interactive viewer - is this path properly validated to prevent the viewer from accessing arbitrary files on the filesystem? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Struct: Disassemble] [CLI Parameter Injection] The module_or_script_name field at line 24 accepts arbitrary strings from command line - are there injection vulnerabilities when this string is used in package lookup operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Struct: Disassemble] [Boolean Flag Abuse] The interactive boolean flag at line 18 controls execution mode - could this flag be manipulated in automated environments to trigger unintended interactive sessions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic Safety] If the disassemble() call at line 77 panics due to malformed bytecode, does the CLI handle it gracefully, or could it leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Output Injection] The println! macro at line 77 outputs disassembled bytecode directly - could malicious bytecode contain terminal escape sequences that execute commands or manipulate the terminal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Module vs Script Ambiguity] The code tries to resolve as both module (line 41) and script (line 42) - could this ambiguity be exploited to disassemble a different artifact than intended if naming collisions exist? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Pseudo Script Name] The ModuleName::pseudo_script_name_builder() call at line 47 uses hardcoded index 0 - is this assumption safe, or could scripts with different indices be missed or incorrectly accessed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [CompiledUnit Pattern Match] The pattern match at lines 62-75 only handles Module and scripts differently - are there other CompiledUnit variants that should be handled, or could unhandled variants cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Interactive Mode Restriction] Line 74 explicitly bails for scripts in interactive mode - is this restriction properly enforced, or could the match arms be reordered to bypass it? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Compilation Side Effects] The compile_package() call at line 36 modifies the Vec passed to it - could this vec contain sensitive data that gets leaked or modified unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/disassemble.rs] [Function: execute()] [Dependency Chain Attack] When compiling the package, are all transitive dependencies validated, or could a malicious dependency introduce backdoored bytecode that gets disassembled and potentially influences the developer?
