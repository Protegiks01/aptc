  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Arc cloning] If ExecutedChunk fields contain Arc<>, can improper Arc cloning lead to unintended sharing of mutable state across chunks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Drop order] When ExecutedChunk is dropped, is there a safe drop order for output and ledger_info_opt, or can drop order dependencies cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Atomicity violation] Can the transition from ChunkToUpdateLedger to ExecutedChunk fail partway through, leaving the system in an inconsistent state with partially updated ledgers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Commit failure] If save_transactions() fails when committing an ExecutedChunk, is the chunk properly rolled back from the commit queue, or can it remain in an ambiguous state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [State recovery] After a crash during ExecutedChunk commit, can the system recover consistently, or might some chunks be partially committed causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Version gap] If ExecutedChunk commits skip versions (e.g., version 100, 102, skipping 101), can this cause merkle tree corruption or proof generation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Non-deterministic output] Can different validators construct ExecutedChunk with different output fields from the same input transactions, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Hash inconsistency] If ExecutedChunk's output produces different state hashes on different validators due to non-deterministic execution, can this cause permanent chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Timestamp drift] Can ExecutedChunk commits with ledger_info_opt have inconsistent timestamps across validators, breaking block time assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Genesis construction] During genesis, is the ExecutedChunk constructed with proper validation of the genesis ledger_info_opt, or can malformed genesis cause bootstrap failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Genesis replay] Can the genesis ExecutedChunk be replayed or committed multiple times, causing duplicate genesis blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker cause ExecutedChunk instances with large PartialStateComputeResult outputs to accumulate in memory, causing OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Clone overhead] If ExecutedChunk fields are cloned during processing (e.g., state_summary, transaction_accumulator), can this cause excessive memory usage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Pipeline stall] If ExecutedChunk processing in commit_chunk_impl() blocks due to I/O, can this stall the entire execution pipeline and affect liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Error propagation] If an error occurs during ExecutedChunk commit, is it properly propagated and handled, or can silent failures occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Partial commit] Can an ExecutedChunk be partially committed (e.g., state updated but transaction accumulator not), causing state/ledger mismatch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Chunk verifier bypass] Is ExecutedChunk validated by ChunkResultVerifier before commit, or can verification be bypassed allowing invalid chunks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [State proof] Does ExecutedChunk's output contain valid state proofs that can be verified against the merkle root, or can invalid proofs be committed? (High)",
