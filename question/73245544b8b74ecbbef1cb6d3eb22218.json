(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/verified_module_cache.rs] [Static: VERIFIED_MODULES_CACHE] [Cache initialization determinism] Does the global cache initialize identically across all validator nodes at genesis or after restarts, or can initialization timing differences cause divergent cache states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/verified_module_cache.rs] [Function: verifier_cache_enabled()] [Feature flag consistency] If the disable_verifier_cache feature is compiled differently across validator nodes, can this cause fundamental execution behavior differences where some nodes cache and others don't?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/verified_module_cache.rs] [Struct: VerifiedModuleCache] [Mutex poisoning] If a thread panics while holding the Mutex lock in contains(), put(), or flush(), does the Mutex become poisoned, and can this cause all subsequent cache operations to fail, breaking verification for the entire validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/verified_module_cache.rs] [Function: contains()] [Lock panic handling] If the lock().get() operation panics due to LRU cache internal errors, is the panic handled gracefully, or can it propagate and crash the validator during block execution?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/verified_module_cache.rs] [Function: put()] [Error handling] If put() is called after verification completes but the module actually failed verification, can this incorrect usage poison the cache and allow unverified modules to execute?
