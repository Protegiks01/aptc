  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Transaction Manipulation] When calling render_transactions_sequential() in lines 148-152, can an attacker exploit the sequential rendering to reorder transactions or inject fake transactions into the block response? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Does the block_timestamp passed to render_transactions_sequential() in line 151 get validated, or can manipulated timestamps cause transactions to appear at incorrect times breaking audit trails? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Transaction Truncation] If bcs_block.transactions is Some but contains partial transaction data due to size limits, does the function indicate truncation clearly, or can clients incorrectly assume they have complete block data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [None Transaction Handling] When bcs_block.transactions is None (line 154), is this properly distinguished from an empty block, preventing clients from incorrectly caching incomplete block data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Panic on Error] Does the function properly handle errors from context.get_block_by_height() with Result types, or can exceptional conditions (like database failures) cause unwrap() panics that crash the API server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_version()] [Panic on Error] Can errors from context.get_block_by_version() propagate as panics instead of proper error responses, causing API crashes that affect consensus or validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Error Propagation] Does BasicResponse::try_from_json() and try_from_bcs() properly handle serialization failures, or can malformed block data cause panics that crash the API server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_height()] [410 Error Handling] When get_block_by_height() should return 410 for pruned blocks, is this error properly propagated, or can error handling bugs expose pruned data or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_version()] [410 Error Handling] Does the function correctly return HTTP 410 for pruned blocks, or can improper error handling allow access to pruned data that should be unavailable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Nested Error Handling] When render_transactions_sequential() fails in line 148, is the error properly wrapped and returned, or can error handling bugs expose internal error details or cause information leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Failpoint Abuse] Can the fail_point_poem() call in line 52 be exploited by attackers to artificially trigger failures, causing denial of service or exposing failpoint-specific code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_version()] [Failpoint Abuse] Does fail_point_poem() in line 92 have proper access control, or can attackers enable failpoints to cause API failures and test production behavior without authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Failpoint State Corruption] Can failpoint injection at line 52 leave the API in an inconsistent state where subsequent requests see corrupted block data or stale caches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Hash Verification] Does the function verify that bcs_block.block_hash matches the computed hash of block contents before returning it, or can corrupted storage return blocks with invalid hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Version Range Validation] Are first_version and last_version in lines 160-161 validated to be consistent (first <= last), or can corrupted block data expose invalid version ranges causing client errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: render_bcs_block()] [Block Height Consistency] Is bcs_block.block_height validated against the expected height based on version, or can inconsistent block metadata cause chain validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_by_height()] [Merkle Root Validation] Does the function validate that the block's state root matches the Merkle tree commitment, or can storage corruption return blocks with invalid state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/blocks.rs] [Function: get_block_by_height()] [Boolean Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the with_transactions parameter using Query<Option<bool>> to bypass transaction retrieval limits and extract more data than intended? (Medium)",
