  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [PackageName Validation] Is the dep_name parameter validated to prevent injection attacks when used in error messages or file paths, or can it contain malicious control characters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Dependency Context Loss] If checkout() fails, does error handling preserve enough context to identify which package and version failed, or can attackers exploit confusion in multi-package builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Package Version Confusion] Can attackers cause version confusion by manipulating branch names to match legitimate package versions but point to malicious commits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Argument Order Vulnerability] Does the order of arguments to 'git clone' matter for security, or can attackers exploit parsing ambiguities where URLs might be interpreted as paths or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Flag Injection] Can the '-C' flag in checkout() be exploited if repo_path contains special patterns, potentially causing git to ignore the flag and operate on a different repository? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Remote Name Exploitation] Does hardcoding 'origin' as the remote name prevent attackers from exploiting git configurations where 'origin' has been redefined to point to malicious repositories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Option Confusion] Can the '--hard' flag in reset_hard() be bypassed or modified if git interprets subsequent arguments as additional options rather than the target revision? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Permission Preservation] Does git clone preserve file permissions and execute bits from the remote repository, potentially allowing cloned repositories to contain executable malware? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Execute Permission Attack] Can checkout() inadvertently make files executable (via git attributes) that could be exploited in subsequent build or execution steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Directory Permission Weakness] Are cloned directories created with secure permissions, or can other users on the system access or modify dependency repositories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: reset_hard()] [Permission Reset Vulnerability] Does reset_hard() restore file permissions to potentially dangerous states, allowing previously restricted files to become world-writable or executable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Core.autocrlf Exploitation] Can attackers exploit git's core.autocrlf setting to inject Windows-specific line endings that cause files to be interpreted differently on different platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Core.symlinks Vulnerability] If core.symlinks is enabled in git config, can cloned repositories contain dangerous symbolic links on Windows systems where symlink handling differs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: checkout()] [Clean/Smudge Filters] Can malicious git clean/smudge filters in cloned repositories execute arbitrary code when files are checked out? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Transfer.fsckObjects] Is git's transfer.fsckObjects enabled to verify object integrity during fetch, or can corrupted or malicious objects be fetched without validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [Unencrypted Git Protocol] Can clone() be forced to use the unencrypted git:// protocol, exposing cloned data to network eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [HTTP Downgrade Attack] Can attackers force clone() to downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing interception and modification of repository contents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: fetch_origin()] [Certificate Validation] Does fetch_origin() properly validate TLS certificates, or can self-signed or expired certificates be accepted, enabling MitM attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package/src/resolution/git.rs] [Function: clone()] [DNS Rebinding] Can attackers exploit DNS rebinding attacks where the git repository URL resolves to different IPs between initial validation and actual clone operation? (Medium)",
