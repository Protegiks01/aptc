  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker provide a maliciously large blocklist file via ListManagerConfig that causes memory exhaustion during initialization, leading to faucet service denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization race condition] Is there proper synchronization when multiple threads attempt to initialize RefererBlocklistChecker concurrently, or can race conditions lead to inconsistent blocklist state across different checker instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [File path traversal] Does the ListManagerConfig file path validation prevent directory traversal attacks, or can an attacker load arbitrary files from the filesystem by manipulating the config path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Symbolic link exploitation] Can an attacker use symbolic links in the blocklist file path to read sensitive system files or cause the service to load unintended blocklist data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Error information disclosure] Does the error handling in new() leak sensitive filesystem information or internal paths when the blocklist file fails to load, potentially aiding reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Missing header bypass] Can an attacker bypass the blocklist entirely by omitting the Referer header, since the function returns Ok(vec![]) when the header is missing, allowing blocked referers to fund accounts by simply not sending the header? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Header injection] Can an attacker inject multiple Referer headers or use header folding techniques to bypass blocklist validation, exploiting how .get(REFERER) handles multiple header values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Invalid UTF-8 bypass] Does the .to_str().ok() conversion silently fail on non-UTF-8 referer values, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist by sending binary or invalid UTF-8 data in the Referer header? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Case sensitivity bypass] Is the referer matching case-sensitive in manager.contains(), allowing attackers to bypass blocklisting by changing the case of blocked domains (e.g., 'Evil.com' vs 'evil.com' vs 'EVIL.COM')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Unicode normalization bypass] Can attackers use Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) or homograph attacks with visually similar characters to bypass referer blocklisting (e.g., using Cyrillic 'а' instead of Latin 'a')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [URL encoding bypass] Does the checker handle URL-encoded referer values, or can attackers bypass the blocklist by encoding characters in the referer (e.g., 'evil%2Ecom' or 'evil.c%6Fm')? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Punycode domain bypass] Can attackers use Punycode-encoded international domain names to bypass ASCII-based blocklist entries (e.g., 'xn--evil-domain' instead of blocked unicode domain)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Whitespace manipulation] Can attackers bypass blocklisting by adding leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, or other whitespace characters to the referer value that aren't properly stripped before comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Protocol scheme bypass] If the blocklist only contains domain names, can attackers bypass checks by using different schemes (http:// vs https:// vs ftp:// vs // protocol-relative URLs)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Port number bypass] Can attackers bypass domain-based blocklisting by appending port numbers to blocked domains (e.g., 'evil.com:8080' vs 'evil.com')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Path component bypass] If only full URLs are blocklisted, can attackers use the same domain with different paths, or vice versa, to bypass the blocklist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Query parameter bypass] Can attackers append query parameters to blocked referers to bypass exact string matching (e.g., 'evil.com?x=1' vs 'evil.com')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Fragment identifier bypass] Can attackers use URL fragments (#fragment) to bypass blocklisting if the comparison doesn't normalize or strip fragments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Subdomain bypass] If only root domains are blocklisted, can attackers use subdomains to bypass checks (e.g., 'sub.evil.com' when only 'evil.com' is blocked)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [TLD substitution bypass] Can attackers bypass blocklisting by using alternative TLDs for the same domain (e.g., 'evil.net' when 'evil.com' is blocked)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IP address bypass] If domain names are blocklisted, can attackers use IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) to reference the same blocked sites and bypass the check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 format bypass] Can attackers use different IPv6 address representations (compressed, expanded, with zone IDs) to bypass IP-based blocklisting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [URL shortener bypass] Can attackers use URL shortening services to mask blocked referers, since the checker only sees the shortener domain rather than the final destination? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/referer_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Redirect chain bypass] Can attackers set up redirect chains where the immediate referer is not blocklisted but ultimately leads to blocked content? (Medium)",
