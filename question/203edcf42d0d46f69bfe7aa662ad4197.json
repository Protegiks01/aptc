  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Information Disclosure] Does the println! macro at line 16 leak sensitive internal state information (delayed field values, transaction data, validator identities) to stdout that could be exploited by attackers monitoring node logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft inputs that trigger repeated calls to code_invariant_error() with large Debug format messages, causing unbounded memory allocation in the format!() macro and potential node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Log Injection] Can an attacker inject control characters or ANSI escape codes through the Debug implementation of message M to manipulate log parsing, hide malicious activity, or crash log monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Status Code Abuse] Since this function always returns DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR, can an attacker exploit the special handling of this status code to force sequential execution fallback, causing denial of service through performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Error Message Manipulation] Can an attacker control the Debug output of message M to inject misleading error messages that confuse operators or automated monitoring systems, masking actual exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Panic Behavior] If the Debug implementation of M panics during format!(), will this cause an unhandled panic that crashes the validator node without proper cleanup of transaction state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Unicode Handling] Can malicious Unicode in the message parameter cause buffer overflows or incorrect string handling in the println! or format! macros on certain platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: code_invariant_error()] [Error Propagation] Since this creates a PartialVMError that signals BlockSTM for fallback, can an attacker repeatedly trigger this in parallel execution to force permanent sequential execution, degrading network throughput to enable double-spending attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Invariant Violation] Can an attacker provide malicious inputs that cause expect_ok() to convert legitimate errors into code_invariant_error, incorrectly triggering BlockSTM fallback and causing consensus inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Error Suppression] Does expect_ok() properly preserve error context from the original error E, or can critical security information be lost during the map_err conversion, hiding exploit attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Type Safety] Since expect_ok() accepts any error type E: Debug, can an attacker exploit weaknesses in specific Debug implementations to cause unexpected behavior during error conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Assumption Violation] What happens if expect_ok() is called on operations that should be allowed to fail (e.g., user input validation)? Can this cause legitimate errors to be treated as invariant violations, triggering unnecessary sequential fallback? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Function: expect_ok()] [Resource Leak] If expect_ok() is called in a loop and repeatedly returns errors (converted to code_invariant_error), can the accumulated error messages cause memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [StatusCode: DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR] [Consensus Inconsistency] When code_invariant_error() is called during parallel execution, does BlockSTM ensure all validators fallback to sequential mode consistently, or can some validators execute in parallel while others are sequential, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [StatusCode: DELAYED_FIELD_OR_BLOCKSTM_CODE_INVARIANT_ERROR] [Transaction Discarding] Since transactions with this error code are discarded in sequential fallback, can an attacker craft transactions that trigger code_invariant_error to censor legitimate transactions and break liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage Context] [Race Condition] When multiple threads in Block-STM parallel execution simultaneously call code_invariant_error(), can race conditions in the println! output or error handling cause data races or incorrect transaction ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage Context] [Delayed Field Validation] If code_invariant_error() is incorrectly called during delayed field validation instead of returning a speculative error, can this cause valid transactions to be discarded, leading to fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage Context] [State Rollback] When a transaction triggers code_invariant_error during execution, is the state properly rolled back, or can partial state changes be committed, causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage Context] [Aggregator Operations] Can an attacker exploit the delayed field aggregator operations to deliberately trigger code_invariant_error() in specific execution paths, manipulating which transactions succeed in parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Usage Context] [Speculative Execution] Is there proper differentiation between code_invariant_error (should never happen) and speculative errors (expected during parallel execution), or can confusion between these cause incorrect transaction outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: Prologue] If code_invariant_error() is triggered during transaction prologue validation, will it be converted to UNEXPECTED_ERROR_FROM_KNOWN_MOVE_FUNCTION as intended, or can special handling bypass security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: Epilogue] If code_invariant_error() occurs during epilogue (gas payment), can this cause gas to not be charged, enabling free transaction spam attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: Resource Groups] When resource groups are being processed and code_invariant_error() is triggered, can this cause incomplete resource group updates leading to inconsistent state across related resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: Change Sets] If code_invariant_error() occurs during change set materialization, can partially applied changes create invalid state that passes Merkle tree verification but violates application invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/delayed_values/error.rs] [Integration: View Functions] Can expect_ok() be misused in read-only view functions where errors should be allowed, causing view queries to incorrectly trigger code_invariant_error and affect transaction execution?
