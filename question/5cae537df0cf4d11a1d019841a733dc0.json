  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Dev mode in production] Can the -dev flag at line 56 be accidentally used in production deployments, disabling all Vault security features (encryption at rest, audit logging, sealed state) and exposing validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [No persistence] Does dev mode at line 56 use in-memory storage without persistence, meaning validator keys and consensus secrets are lost on Vault restart, potentially causing validator slashing or consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [No audit logging] Does the -dev mode disable Vault audit logging, preventing detection of unauthorized access to validator private keys or other cryptographic material used in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [No seal mechanism] Does dev mode at line 56 disable Vault's seal mechanism, leaving cryptographic secrets unencrypted in memory and vulnerable to cold-boot attacks or memory dumps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Unlimited access] Does the dev-root-token-id at line 57 provide unlimited access without any policies or restrictions, allowing the root token to perform any operation including exfiltrating all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Test: run_vault()] [Test isolation] Does run_vault() at lines 133-146 properly isolate test Vault instances, or can secrets from one test leak into another through shared Vault state or persistent storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Test: run_test_vault()] [State pollution] Does run_test_vault() at lines 148-155 clean up Vault state after tests, or can leftover secrets from previous tests interfere with subsequent security tests and create false positives/negatives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: client()] [Test credential leakage] Can the Client returned by client() at line 122-130 be misused to access test Vault instances from production code, leaking test credentials into production environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Static: APTOS_VAULT] [Global state contamination] Does the global APTOS_VAULT static at lines 12-23 prevent proper test isolation, allowing security bugs in one test to affect others through shared Vault instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Format string injection] Can the format!() calls at lines 57-58 be exploited with malicious inputs in ROOT_TOKEN or port number to cause format string vulnerabilities or command injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Constant: BINARY] [Path traversal] Is the BINARY constant at line 36 validated to prevent path traversal attacks where an attacker replaces 'vault' with '../../../malicious-binary' to execute arbitrary code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: _transit()] [Injection in address] Can the format!() at line 98 for -address parameter be exploited if host contains special characters, allowing argument injection into the vault CLI command? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Struct: VaultRunner] [Host validation] Does VaultRunner validate the host string at line 44 to prevent injection of malicious URLs, redirect attacks, or SSRF vulnerabilities when Client makes API calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [String allocation] Can extremely large port numbers or manipulated HOST values cause excessive string allocations at line 67, leading to memory exhaustion DoS in test infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: _port()] [Integer overflow] Can the port number returned at line 86 overflow or wrap around, causing Vault to bind to privileged ports (<1024) that could be exploited for privilege escalation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Struct: VaultRunner] [Drop safety] Does VaultRunner implement Drop correctly to ensure child process cleanup, or can panic during destruction leave orphaned Vault processes with root access running indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: test_host()] [Option unwrap] Does unwrap() at line 33 handle all edge cases properly, or can None values during concurrent initialization cause undefined behavior or use-after-free issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Constant: HOST] [Hardcoded URL] Does the hardcoded 'http://localhost' at line 37 create deployment issues where tests fail to detect misconfigurations that would occur in production with real network URLs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Binary path] Is the 'vault' binary path at line 36 searched from PATH, allowing attackers to place malicious binaries in PATH to be executed with test infrastructure privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Working directory] Does vault spawn at line 60-65 inherit the working directory, potentially accessing or writing sensitive files in unexpected locations if cwd is compromised? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: _transit()] [Engine configuration] Does enabling transit secrets engine at line 99 use secure default configuration, or can weak cryptographic parameters be inherited that compromise validator key security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: run()] [Process priority] Does the spawned Vault process inherit scheduling priority, allowing it to monopolize CPU and cause DoS for other critical validator components like consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: _port()] [Socket options] Does the TcpListener at line 78 set proper socket options (SO_REUSEADDR, SO_REUSEPORT), or can improper settings cause port binding failures that prevent security tests from running? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Function: client()] [Connection pooling] Does the Client created at line 122-130 properly handle connection pooling, or can connection exhaustion occur when many tests run concurrently, causing timeouts that hide security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/dev.rs] [Static: APTOS_VAULT] [Initialization order] Can static initialization order issues cause APTOS_VAULT to be accessed before proper initialization, leading to null pointer dereferences or use-before-init bugs? (Medium)"
