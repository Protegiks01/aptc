  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Error silencing] The result is discarded with let _ = at line 158, but does this hide critical errors that should cause the validator to disconnect from malicious peers attempting authentication attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly send malformed handshake responses that cause the initiator to consume excessive CPU or memory in upgrade_outbound parsing logic, leading to validator slowdowns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Nonce manipulation] Could fuzz data manipulate the Noise protocol nonce counter in a way that causes nonce reuse in subsequent encrypted messages, completely breaking the encryption security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Key confirmation] Does fuzzing test for missing key confirmation attacks where the initiator believes the handshake succeeded but the responder used different keys, causing all subsequent messages to fail decryption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Timestamp injection] Even though fake_timestamp is used, can fuzz data inject a malicious timestamp in the responder's message that causes incorrect anti-replay state updates when real timestamps are used in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Peer ID confusion] Can malformed handshake data cause the initiator to associate the established session with the wrong peer_id, allowing an attacker to impersonate a different validator in subsequent consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_initiator()] [Panic attacks] Does the fuzzer test for inputs that cause panics in upgrade_outbound, which could be exploited by Byzantine peers to crash honest validators and reduce network liveness below 2/3 threshold? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Malformed initiator message] Can an attacker craft malicious data that causes buffer overflows, integer overflows, or memory corruption vulnerabilities when upgrade_inbound at line 181 parses the initiator's first handshake message? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Authentication bypass] Does fuzzing adequately test whether an attacker can bypass client authentication checks in HandshakeAuthMode::server_only, allowing unauthorized peers to establish connections to validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Public key forgery] Can fuzz data inject a forged public key in the initiator's handshake message that the responder accepts as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate any peer in the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Trailing data injection] Does set_trailing() at line 178 allow an attacker to append malicious payload data after the handshake that gets processed incorrectly, potentially bypassing input validation in subsequent message handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Session hijacking] Can malformed handshake data cause upgrade_inbound to establish a session with incorrect keys, allowing an attacker to decrypt or inject messages in that session? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Replay attack] Even with fake_timestamp disabling anti-replay, does the fuzzer test whether upgrade_inbound properly validates timestamp ordering when real timestamps are used, or can attackers replay old handshake messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Error handling bypass] The result is silently discarded at line 181, but could this hide vulnerabilities where upgrade_inbound should reject malicious handshake attempts but instead returns Ok with compromised session state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker flood responders with malformed handshake messages that consume excessive CPU or memory in cryptographic operations, causing validator performance degradation affecting consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [DH key validation] Does fuzzing test for invalid Diffie-Hellman public keys (e.g., identity element, small subgroup) in the initiator's message that could weaken or break the key agreement protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Length field manipulation] Can fuzz data manipulate length fields in the handshake message to cause integer overflows when allocating buffers, leading to heap corruption exploitable for remote code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Cipher suite downgrade] Could malformed handshake data cause the responder to negotiate a weaker cipher suite than the default AES-256-GCM, reducing encryption security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [Peer ID extraction] Can fuzz data cause incorrect peer_id extraction from the handshake, allowing an attacker to cause the responder to misidentify the remote peer and violate access control policies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_responder()] [State machine violation] Does fuzzing test for handshake messages that arrive out of order or violate the Noise IK protocol state machine, potentially causing undefined behavior in the protocol implementation?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Dummy session] Using NoiseSession::new_for_testing() at line 195 creates a dummy session that may not have proper initialization, so could this miss vulnerabilities in how NoiseStream handles malformed encrypted messages with real session keys?

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/noise/fuzzing.rs] [Function: fuzz_post_handshake()] [Buffer size limitation] The fixed 1024-byte buffer at line 200 limits fuzzing to small messages, but can an attacker exploit large encrypted messages to cause buffer overflows or excessive memory allocation in NoiseStream::read?
