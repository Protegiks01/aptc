  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Label uniqueness] Are all error labels returned by get_label() unique, or can label collisions cause different errors to be incorrectly aggregated in metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Label stability] If error variants are added/renamed, can get_label() return inconsistent labels across different code versions, breaking monitoring dashboards? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Static lifetime safety] Does the 'static lifetime guarantee in get_label() prevent any potential memory safety issues when labels are used across thread boundaries? (Low)",
