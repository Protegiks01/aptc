  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 12-17] [Environment variable injection] Can an attacker inject malicious values through the NETWORK_NAME environment variable that bypass NetworkName parsing validation, potentially causing the tester to connect to attacker-controlled nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 12-17] [Configuration bypass] Does the NETWORK_NAME parsing properly validate all possible string inputs, or can specially crafted strings (e.g., 'testnet\\0devnet', Unicode characters, control characters) bypass validation and cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 12-17] [Default value security] Is the default NetworkName::Devnet value safe for production environments, or could forgetting to set NETWORK_NAME cause tests to execute against unintended networks with different security properties? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 12-17] [Race condition] Since NETWORK_NAME uses Lazy initialization, can concurrent access during first initialization from multiple threads cause race conditions or inconsistent network selection across different test threads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 19-20] [URL injection] Does the hardcoded DEVNET_NODE_URL properly validate the URL scheme and prevent protocol downgrade attacks (e.g., http:// instead of https://) that could expose test traffic to MITM attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 19-20] [DNS spoofing] Can an attacker performing DNS cache poisoning redirect 'fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com' to a malicious server, causing the API tester to send test transactions to attacker-controlled infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 22-23] [Faucet compromise] If DEVNET_FAUCET_URL is compromised or points to a malicious faucet service, can an attacker control account funding amounts or inject malicious account states during test setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 25-26] [URL validation] Does TESTNET_NODE_URL parsing use unwrap() without proper error handling, potentially causing panic if the hardcoded URL is malformed or if the url crate has parsing bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 28-29] [Authentication bypass] Is TESTNET_FAUCET_URL protected by authentication mechanisms, or can any attacker directly fund arbitrary accounts during testing, potentially affecting test isolation and resource availability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 19-29] [URL substitution] Can environment variables override these hardcoded URLs in downstream code usage, and if so, could an attacker inject malicious node/faucet URLs to redirect all test traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Line: 31] [Integer overflow] Is FUND_AMOUNT = 100_000_000 used in arithmetic operations that could overflow when multiplied or added with other values during test account funding or balance checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Line: 31] [Economic impact] If FUND_AMOUNT is used on mainnet or production testnet, could repeatedly requesting this amount drain faucet resources or enable economic attacks against test infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Line: 31] [Type confusion] Is FUND_AMOUNT properly converted between u64 and other numeric types (U256, etc.) in downstream code, or could type conversions introduce truncation or overflow bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 36-42] [Environment variable parsing] Can an attacker inject extremely large PERSISTENCY_TIMEOUT values (e.g., u64::MAX seconds) through environment variables, causing tests to hang indefinitely and enabling DoS of test infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 36-42] [Integer overflow] When parsing PERSISTENCY_TIMEOUT from string to u64, are there proper bounds checks to prevent overflow when converting to Duration::from_secs, which could wrap around and create near-zero timeouts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 36-42] [Negative value injection] Does the parsing logic properly reject negative values or invalid numeric strings for PERSISTENCY_TIMEOUT, or can malformed input cause panic or unexpected timeout behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 36-42] [Default timeout safety] Is the default 30-second PERSISTENCY_TIMEOUT sufficient for all network conditions, or could network delays cause legitimate tests to fail, masking real bugs or creating false negatives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 45-51] [Sleep duration attack] Can an attacker inject SLEEP_PER_CYCLE = 0 through environment variables, causing the test loop to spin at 100% CPU and DoS the test execution environment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 45-51] [Time-based race conditions] If SLEEP_PER_CYCLE is set too low, can race conditions emerge in the tested API endpoints that wouldn't occur under normal timing, creating false test failures or missing real bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 45-51] [Millisecond overflow] When parsing SLEEP_PER_CYCLE and converting to Duration::from_millis, can extremely large values cause overflow or unexpected behavior in the duration calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 56-61] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker inject NUM_THREADS = u64::MAX through environment variables, causing the runtime to attempt creating an unbounded number of threads and crashing the test process through OOM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 56-61] [Zero threads] Does the NUM_THREADS parsing properly validate that the value is > 0, or can NUM_THREADS = 0 cause division-by-zero errors or deadlocks in the thread pool initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 56-61] [Thread pool DoS] If NUM_THREADS is set to 1 while running many tests concurrently, can this create a bottleneck that causes legitimate tests to timeout and mask real API performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/consts.rs] [Lines: 56-61] [Default thread count] Is the default of 4 threads optimal for all testing environments, or could this cause test failures on systems with fewer CPU cores or create resource contention? (Low)",
