(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Memory safety] Does to_be_bytes().to_vec() properly handle memory allocation failures, or can out-of-memory conditions during encoding cause data corruption or validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/block_by_version/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Reference lifetime] Can the mutable reference in decode_key(mut data: &[u8]) lead to use-after-free if the slice is freed while read_u64() is executing, causing undefined behavior? (High)",
