  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: Share::aggregate()] [Weak randomness] The SHA3-256 hash of the WVUF evaluation is used as randomness - is the evaluation entropy sufficient to prevent grinding attacks where validators try to influence outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Constant: FUTURE_ROUNDS_TO_ACCEPT] [DoS vector] The value of 200 future rounds - can Byzantine validators flood the system with shares for 200 rounds ahead to exhaust memory or computational resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: AugmentedData::generate()] [Delta conflicts] If add_certified_delta() succeeds for self but fails for the fast_delta, is the state left inconsistent with partially applied augmented data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: AugmentedData::augment()] [Expect panic] Both add_certified_delta() calls use expect() - can Byzantine validators provide deltas that cause invariant violations leading to panics? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: AugmentedData::verify()] [Fast path validation] The ensure! check for fast_delta presence - can a Byzantine validator exploit the asymmetry by providing fast_delta when it shouldn't exist or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: RandConfig::get_id()] [Panic risk] The expect() call will panic if peer is not in the validator set - can this be triggered during epoch transitions where the validator set is changing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: RandConfig::add_certified_apk()] [Race condition] If multiple threads call add_certified_apk() for the same peer simultaneously, can OnceCell allow duplicate APK additions or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: RandConfig::derive_apk()] [Cryptographic failure] If WVUF::augment_pubkey() fails for invalid deltas, is the error properly propagated or can partially augmented keys be used? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: RandConfig::threshold()] [Integer overflow] Is get_threshold_weight() validated against overflow when cast to u64, potentially allowing threshold bypasses with extremely large weight values? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: RandShare::verify()] [Circular verification] Does this function properly delegate to the inner share's verify(), or can custom TShare implementations bypass verification by providing no-op implementations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: AugData::verify()] [Author mismatch] The ensure! checks that self.author == sender, but is this check performed before or after cryptographic verification, potentially allowing sender spoofing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: AugDataSignature::verify()] [Signature verification] Does verifier.verify() properly validate that the signature was created for this specific aug_data, or can signature from different data be replayed? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [Function: CertifiedAugData::verify()] [Quorum validation] Does verify_multi_signatures() check that signatures meet the quorum threshold, or just that they're valid, allowing sub-threshold certifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: ShareAggregator::add_share()] [Weight calculation] If shares HashMap already contains a share from an author, is the total_weight correctly NOT incremented, or can duplicate shares inflate the weight calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: ShareAggregator::try_aggregate()] [Threshold bypass] Can Byzantine validators manipulate get_peer_weight() to return artificially high weights, allowing them to reach threshold with fewer than required honest validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: ShareAggregator::try_aggregate()] [Expect panic] The expect() on 'Aggregated item should have self share' can panic - can a Byzantine validator trigger a state where self_share is missing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: ShareAggregator::try_aggregate()] [Aggregation error handling] If S::aggregate() returns an error, it's logged but decision_tx doesn't receive anything - can this cause blocks to remain stuck in the queue indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: ShareAggregator::retain()] [Metadata mismatch] After retain(), is total_weight recalculated correctly if some shares are removed, or can weight calculations become inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::add_share()] [State machine bypass] Can a Byzantine validator send shares in a specific order to transition RandItem from PendingMetadata directly to Decided, bypassing the PendingDecision state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::add_share()] [Metadata validation] The ensure! checks that share metadata matches block metadata - is this comparison done correctly including all fields (epoch, round, hash), or can partial matches succeed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::try_aggregate()] [Memory replacement] The std::mem::replace() creates a temporary dummy RandItem - can this cause issues if the function panics or is interrupted mid-execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::add_metadata()] [State transition] If add_metadata() is called when already in PendingDecision state, does it silently ignore the metadata or could this cause inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandItem::get_all_shares_authors()] [Unreachable] The unreachable! for PendingMetadata state assumes this is never called before block is added - can Byzantine validators trigger this through out-of-order message delivery? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_store.rs] [Function: RandStore::new()] [Initial state] Is highest_known_round initialized correctly, or can shares be rejected as 'future rounds' during the initial startup phase? (Medium)",
