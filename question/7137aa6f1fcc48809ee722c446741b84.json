(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/consensus_config.rs] [Function: generate_consensus_upgrade_proposal()] [Double Reconfiguration] If consensus_config::set_for_next_epoch() and aptos_governance::reconfigure() are called in sequence, can race conditions cause double reconfigurations or skipped epoch updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/consensus_config.rs] [Function: generate_consensus_upgrade_proposal()] [Atomic Failure] Are the operations at lines 42-45 atomic - if aptos_governance::reconfigure() fails after set_for_next_epoch() succeeds, can this leave consensus in an inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/consensus_config.rs] [Function: generate_consensus_upgrade_proposal()] [Rollback Attack] If the proposal execution fails after partial application, can the consensus config be left in an intermediate state that breaks consensus until manual intervention?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/consensus_config.rs] [Function: generate_consensus_upgrade_proposal()] [Result Tuple Confusion] The function returns Vec<(String, String)> - can the string tuple ordering be confused by callers, causing filenames and scripts to be swapped? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/consensus_config.rs] [Function: generate_consensus_upgrade_proposal()] [Unwrap Panic] The assertion at line 34 uses assert! which can panic - can this be triggered during proposal generation to crash the release builder?
