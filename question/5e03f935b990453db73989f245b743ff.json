  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_parameters()] [Storage Gas Inconsistency] StorageGasParameters::new() can fail internally. If it returns Ok but with incorrect values due to partial config reads, can this cause state divergence where validators charge different storage fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_parameters()] [IoPricing Manipulation] When IoPricing::V2 is used to overwrite table gas params, can an attacker manipulate the per_item_read or per_byte_read values on-chain to drastically reduce gas costs for storage operations, enabling storage exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_parameters()] [Type Conversion Attack] The assignments use pricing.per_item_read * NumArgs::new(1). Can integer multiplication overflow when per_item_read is set to maximum values, wrapping to zero and allowing free operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_feature_version()] [Default Zero Exploit] When no gas schedule exists, the function returns 0. Can this default value during edge cases enable attackers to exploit vulnerabilities only present in gas version 0 configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_config_from_storage()] [BTreeMap Ordering Attack] GasSchedule is converted to BTreeMap using into_btree_map(). Can an attacker craft gas schedule entries with specific keys to exploit BTreeMap ordering and affect gas parameter parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_parameters()] [Legacy Compatibility Bypass] Gas versions 2-6 use common_load_base_legacy while 7-9 use common_load_base_new. Can version mismatches during upgrades cause validators to use different gas calculation paths, breaking determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/gas.rs] [Function: get_gas_parameters()] [Error Message Injection] The error string 'Failed to initialize storage gas params due to failure to load main gas parameters: {}' includes the inner error. Can this leak sensitive state information or be exploited for log injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Vector Bytecode Bypass] The HashSet filter removes vector methods like 'empty', 'length', 'borrow', etc. if registered as natives. Can an attacker exploit timing where these are partially registered to cause inconsistent native function tables across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Native Registration Race] Multiple native sources (aptos_move_stdlib, aptos_framework, aptos_table_natives) are chained with collect(). Can duplicate function registrations or registration order differences cause determinism violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Println Side Effect] The code uses println! to log errors when vector bytecode methods are mistakenly registered. Can log output differences across validators or during parallel execution affect environment initialization ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Create Signer Injection] When inject_create_signer_for_gov_sim is true, create_signer native is added. Can this flag being set incorrectly in production allow any transaction to create signers for arbitrary addresses and drain accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [SafeNativeBuilder Mutation] The mutable SafeNativeBuilder is passed to multiple native registration functions. Can state accumulated in the builder (gas params, features) be corrupted by one native source, affecting subsequent registrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Vector Method Collision] If a non-stdlib module tries to register a native with module name 'vector' and matching function names, does the filter properly reject it, or can attackers override vector bytecode instructions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [CORE_CODE_ADDRESS Manipulation] All natives use CORE_CODE_ADDRESS as the module address. Can on-chain state corruption or address remapping attacks cause natives to be registered under wrong addresses, breaking Move semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [HashSet Contains Bypass] The vector_bytecode_instruction_methods HashSet checks func_name.as_str(). Can function names with Unicode normalization issues or null bytes bypass the contains() check and allow registration of forbidden natives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/natives.rs] [Function: aptos_natives_with_builder()] [Chain Ordering Dependency] Native functions are collected via .chain().chain().chain(). Does the iteration order guarantee deterministic registration, or can subtle ordering differences cause different function resolution across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Feature Flag Race] Multiple feature flags are checked (ENABLE_ENUM_TYPES, ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_CONTROL, ENABLE_FUNCTION_VALUES). Can concurrent feature flag updates during epoch changes cause validators to initialize VMs with inconsistent configs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_verifier_config()] [Signature Checker Bypass] sig_checker_v2_fix_script_ty_param_count depends on FeatureFlag while sig_checker_v2_fix_function_signatures depends on gas_feature_version. Can mismatched activation cause verification bypass vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Type Max Cost Integer Overflow] type_max_cost is set to 5000, type_base_cost to 100, and type_byte_cost to 1. Can carefully crafted type structures cause the cost calculation (base + bytes) to overflow and wrap to zero, bypassing type size limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_ty_builder()] [Type Depth Bypass] TypeBuilder::with_limits uses max_ty_size and max_ty_depth from gas params. Can these limits be set to extremely high values through governance to enable DoS via deeply nested types that exhaust stack memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_default_ty_builder()] [Fallback Limits Exploit] Default limits are max_ty_size=128, max_ty_depth=20. Can attackers exploit the fallback to these weaker limits during gas parameter failures to bypass stricter production limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_verifier_config()] [Max Loop Depth DoS] max_loop_depth is hardcoded to Some(5). Can attackers craft Move modules with 5 nested loops that consume excessive verification time, causing validator synchronization delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_verifier_config()] [Generic Instantiation Overflow] max_generic_instantiation_length is Some(32). Can recursive generic type instantiations approaching this limit cause exponential verification time or memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_verifier_config()] [Meter Unit Exhaustion] max_per_fun_meter_units and max_per_mod_meter_units are set to Some(1000 * 80000). Can modules with complex control flow designed to just fit under this limit cause verification to consume excessive CPU during block validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/prod_configs.rs] [Function: aptos_prod_vm_config()] [Layout Max Size Race] layout_max_size changes from 256 to 512 at RELEASE_V1_30. Can validators on different gas versions disagree on layout size limits during upgrades, causing deserialization failures and network partition? (Critical)"
