  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Struct: NetbenchConfig] [Integer Overflow] Can the combination of direct_send_data_size and direct_send_per_second values cause integer overflow when calculating bytes-per-second throughput (direct_send_data_size * direct_send_per_second * 1_000_000), leading to incorrect rate calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Struct: NetbenchConfig] [Resource Exhaustion] Can rpc_data_size be set to extremely large values causing each RPC request to consume excessive memory, leading to OOM conditions when combined with rpc_in_flight concurrent requests? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Insecure Default] Is the default max_network_channel_size of 1000 too small for production workloads, potentially causing message drops during high load that could affect consensus or state sync? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Security Bypass] Can the chain_id check be bypassed by passing None as the chain_id parameter, allowing netbench to be enabled on mainnet/testnet without proper validation? (Critical)",
