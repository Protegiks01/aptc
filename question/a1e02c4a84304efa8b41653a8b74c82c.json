  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_destroy_signer()] [Replay Determinism] During transaction replay for historical blocks, does destroy_signer produce exactly the same gas cost and state changes, or can replay diverge from original execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Signer Persistence] Can the master_signer created by this function be serialized and stored in account resources, allowing persistent unauthorized access across transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Cross-Module Passing] Can a malicious module create a signer and pass it to another module, effectively delegating full account control to untrusted code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Event System Abuse] Can signers created by this function be used to emit events as if they came from victim accounts, enabling phishing or reputation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Reentrancy] Can this function be called recursively or in a reentrant manner during signer-based operations, leading to unexpected state changes or privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Integer Overflow in Gas] The gas cost is converted via 25.into() - can this cause integer overflow or type conversion issues on different platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_destroy_signer()] [Gas Calculation Error] The function charges 213 gas for a no-op - is this consistent with Aptos gas schedule, or could it cause transactions to fail unexpectedly due to insufficient gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [Compiler Optimization] Can aggressive compiler optimizations in release mode change the behavior of signer creation in ways that break security assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/natives/src/account.rs] [Function: native_create_signer()] [SmallVec Overflow] The smallvec! macro is used for return values - can an attacker cause stack overflow or heap corruption by manipulating the size of return values? (Medium)"
