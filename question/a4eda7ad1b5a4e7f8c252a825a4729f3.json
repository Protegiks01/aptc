  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund()] [Header injection via HeaderMap parameter] The header_map is passed as reference (&HeaderMap) - can an attacker inject custom headers that bypasser/checker logic doesn't expect, causing authentication bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [JWT logging without validation] jwt_sub is logged with .ok() which hides failures - can invalid JWTs be logged as valid, creating false audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Query parameter parsing] MintRequest uses serde::Deserialize on query params - can an attacker inject unexpected fields or values that cause parsing errors to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Error message exposure] Errors are converted to plaintext with e.message exposed directly - can attackers learn about internal system state or exploitation paths from detailed error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Return txns BCS serialization] When return_txns=true, returns BCS-serialized transactions - can an attacker use these serialized transactions to replay, modify, or analyze transaction structure for attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Retry-After header missing] The legacy endpoint doesn't include Retry-After headers that the /fund endpoint would have - can this lead to more aggressive retry behavior from clients causing additional load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Asset parameter ignored] The mint endpoint doesn't accept an asset parameter like /fund does - can this inconsistency be exploited where legacy clients expect different funding behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [BCS serialization errors] If bcs::to_bytes() fails, it returns a generic anyhow error - can an attacker craft transactions that fail BCS serialization in exploitable ways? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [Hex encoding without validation] Hex encoding uses hex::encode() without validation - can this produce ambiguous or exploitable hex representations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: mint()] [GET vs POST inconsistency] Legacy mint uses Query params (GET) while /fund uses Json body (POST) - can this parsing difference allow bypass attacks that work on one endpoint but not the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [Error response status determination] Uses error_code.status().is_server_error() to determine response_is_500 - can an attacker manipulate error codes to change this flag and affect complete() logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [Partial transaction submission] If funding fails after submitting some transactions, txn_hashes are extracted from error - can this lead to state inconsistency where checkers see partial completion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: preprocess_request()] [Error code consistency] Different error paths return different AptosTapErrorCode values - can attackers probe the system by analyzing error codes to learn about system configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [Logging before error propagation] Success/failure is logged before returning the error - can this cause log analysis to miscount successful vs failed funding attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: preprocess_request()] [Permit dropped on error path] When returning error, the SemaphorePermit in the tuple is dropped - can rapid error triggering cause permit churn that affects system stability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: preprocess_request()] [time_request_received_secs immutable] Uses get_current_time_secs() once and stores in CheckerData - can attackers exploit slow processing where actual validation time differs significantly from recorded request time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: preprocess_request()] [No timeout enforcement] There's no timeout for how long preprocess_request() can take - can an attacker intentionally slow down bypassers/checkers to hold semaphore permits indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [Async execution timing] The function is async but timing between preprocess and funding is unpredictable - can attackers exploit timing windows to bypass rate limits through race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund_inner()] [Complete timing variability] Checker.complete() is called sequentially but could take variable time - can slow complete() calls cause timeout issues or allow concurrent requests to exploit timing gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: is_eligible()] [Dry run exploit] is_eligible() uses check_only=true and dry_run=true - can attackers use this endpoint to probe rate limit state without consuming their quota? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: is_eligible()] [Bypass affects eligibility check] If bypass=true, is_eligible() returns Ok(()) immediately - can attackers use this to confirm bypasser configurations without actually requesting funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: is_eligible()] [State modification in dry_run] While check_only=true prevents funding, could checkers still modify state in dry_run mode, allowing attackers to manipulate rate limit counters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: is_eligible()] [Funder initial checks only] Calls funder.fund() with check_only=true - are funder's initial checks sufficient, or could transaction submission reveal additional rejection reasons that is_eligible() misses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund()] [Asset parameter optional] Asset is an optional query parameter - if not provided, what default is used and can attackers exploit asset switching to bypass rate limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/endpoints/fund.rs] [Function: fund()] [Asset validation missing] The asset parameter is passed directly to funder without validation in this file - can attackers request arbitrary or invalid assets? (Medium)"
