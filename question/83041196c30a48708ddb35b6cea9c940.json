  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::insert_waypoint()] [Safety Rules Initialization] Does InitialSafetyRulesConfig::from_file() properly validate the validator_identity_file exists and contains valid consensus keys before configuring safety rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::insert_waypoint()] [File Path Race] Between insert_keys() creating VALIDATOR_IDENTITY and insert_waypoint() using it, can the file be modified causing safety rules to use incorrect consensus keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::save_config()] [Atomic Write Missing] Does save_config() write directly to the final file, or use atomic write-and-rename to prevent partial config files if the process crashes during write? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::save_config()] [Config File Permissions] Are saved config files (node.yaml) created with restrictive permissions, or can other users read sensitive validator configuration including network endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::save_config()] [Double Save Issue] Is save_to_path() called before save_config(), potentially writing two different versions of the config and causing confusion about which is authoritative? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: ValidatorNodeConfig::save_config()] [Error Handling] If save_to_path() succeeds but save_config() fails, is the validator left in an inconsistent state with partial configuration written? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Key Regeneration] Does calling try_from() regenerate keys by calling get_key_objects(None), potentially creating new keys if cache is cleared between init_keys() and this conversion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Network Config Unwrap] Does unwrap() on validator_network and full_node_networks panic if these are None, causing genesis ceremony to fail partway through validator setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Address Conversion] Can try_into() for validator_host and full_node_host fail on malformed addresses, leaving validators without proper network configuration in genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Proof of Possession] Is the BLS12-381 ProofOfPossession::create() resistant to rogue key attacks, or can malicious validators create invalid proofs that pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Key Consistency] Are consensus_public_key, validator_network_public_key, and full_node_network_public_key derived from the same seed, ensuring consistent identity across all network layers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Stake Amount Overflow] Is genesis_stake_amount validated before assignment to stake_amount, or can extremely large values cause overflow in subsequent staking calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Commission Percentage] Is commission_percentage validated to be ≤ 100 before being included in ValidatorConfiguration, or can invalid values break reward distribution logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Account Unification] Does using the same account_address for owner, operator, and voter create security risks where compromise of one role compromises all roles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Public Network Assumption] Does assuming NetworkId::Public exists in full_node_networks cause panic if the network config is missing, breaking genesis for custom network configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: TryFrom<&ValidatorNodeConfig> for ValidatorConfiguration] [Join During Genesis] Is join_during_genesis hardcoded to true, potentially forcing all configured validators to join genesis even if they shouldn't, breaking test scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::public_fullnode()] [Genesis Validation] Is the genesis transaction validated before insertion, or can a malicious genesis be inserted into public fullnodes causing them to sync to a fake chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::public_fullnode()] [Waypoint Trust] Does the fullnode blindly trust the provided waypoint without validation, potentially allowing attackers to redirect fullnodes to malicious chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::public_fullnode()] [Port Randomization] Can randomize_ports() create port conflicts if multiple fullnodes are created simultaneously, causing network binding failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::public_fullnode()] [Identity Collision] Does set_identity() check for peer_id collisions across fullnodes, or can identical peer IDs be generated causing network routing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::validator_fullnode()] [Network Exposure] Does attaching VFN to validator properly isolate the validator's consensus network from the public network, or can attackers access validator consensus through the VFN? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::validator_fullnode()] [Validator Config Validation] Is validator_config validated to actually be a Validator RoleType before extracting VFN network info, or can non-validator configs be passed causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs] [Function: FullnodeNodeConfig::validator_fullnode()] [Identity Cloning] Does cloning public_network.identity allow both validator and VFN to share the same network identity, potentially causing authentication confusion? (High)",
