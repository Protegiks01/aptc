  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Binary downgrade attack] Can an attacker replace newer, secure versions of binaries in the directory with older versions containing known vulnerabilities, and will the CLI detect and prevent this? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Unsigned binary acceptance] Does the update system verify signatures of binaries installed in get_additional_binaries_dir(), or can an attacker inject unsigned malicious binaries that will be executed without warning? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Partial binary update corruption] If binary updates are interrupted (power failure, network issue), can this leave partially-written or corrupted binaries in the directory that will cause undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities when executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Unwrap_or_else error propagation] The function uses unwrap_or_else to default to empty string when HOME/USERPROFILE is not set - does this silent failure propagate to callers, or will they attempt to use invalid paths leading to security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Invalid UTF-8 in environment variables] Can non-UTF-8 byte sequences in HOME/USERPROFILE environment variables cause path parsing errors or security vulnerabilities in filesystem operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Path length overflow] Can extremely long HOME/USERPROFILE values combined with the joined path components exceed maximum path length limits, causing buffer overflows or unexpected behavior in filesystem operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Null byte injection] Can null bytes (\\0) in environment variables truncate paths prematurely, causing binaries to be installed in unexpected parent directories? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Missing security audit logging] Does the function log the resolved binary directory path for security auditing, or can attackers manipulate paths silently without detection in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Binary modification detection] Is there a mechanism to detect when binaries in the directory have been modified after installation, or can tampering go unnoticed until execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Integrity verification bypass] If integrity checks exist for installed binaries, can an attacker exploit the time window between installation and verification to replace binaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Sudo/privilege escalation via binary] If the CLI is run with sudo or elevated privileges, can malicious binaries in the user's home directory be executed with root/admin privileges, achieving privilege escalation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [CI/CD pipeline injection] In CI/CD environments where HOME might be shared or predictable, can an attacker pre-stage malicious binaries that will be executed during automated builds or tests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Shared hosting environment exploit] On shared hosting platforms where multiple users share the same system but have separate HOME directories, can directory permission misconfigurations allow cross-user binary injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/helpers.rs] [Function: get_additional_binaries_dir()] [Filesystem case sensitivity confusion] On case-insensitive filesystems (Windows, macOS default), can attackers exploit case variations in the directory path to bypass security checks or create duplicate directories with different permissions? (Medium)"
