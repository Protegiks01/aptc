  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Struct: IndexerApiArgs] [Default port security] The default indexer_api_port is 8090 - is this port commonly used by other services, creating potential port conflicts or service confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Constant: INDEXER_API_CONTAINER_NAME] [Name collision] The hardcoded container name 'local-testnet-indexer-api' could collide with other Docker containers - can this be exploited to attach to or manipulate unrelated containers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - container lifecycle] [Orphaned containers] If the localnet crashes before calling shutdown steps, does the Hasura container remain running, consuming resources and potentially exposing APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - container lifecycle] [Restart attack] Can an attacker repeatedly crash the Hasura container to trigger constant restarts, causing resource exhaustion or bypassing rate limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Import: aptos_localnet::indexer_api] [External module trust] The file imports HASURA_IMAGE and HASURA_METADATA from aptos_localnet - if that module is compromised, can malicious image references or metadata be injected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Import: bollard] [Docker library vulnerabilities] Does the bollard Docker library properly validate all inputs and handle malicious Docker daemon responses, or could a compromised Docker daemon exploit the Rust client? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Error propagation] When context() is used to wrap errors, does it properly sanitize error messages to avoid leaking sensitive information like connection strings or API keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Panic on unwrap] Line 98 calls .unwrap() when parsing the localhost URL - while this should never fail, could an unexpected environment cause a panic and DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: pre_run()] [Silent failure] If get_docker(), delete_container(), or pull_docker_image() fail, are errors properly propagated or could they be silently swallowed, leading to inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Trait: ServiceManager] [Async cancellation] If the async run_service() future is cancelled or dropped mid-execution, does it properly clean up the Docker container or leave it running? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - existing Hasura loop] [Tokio sleep precision] The loop sleeps for 1 second between health checks - can timing attacks exploit the sleep precision to detect health check scheduling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - wait_container] [Stream handling] The try_collect::<Vec<_>>() on the wait stream could consume unbounded memory if the container produces endless wait events - is this properly bounded? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: IndexerApiManager::new()] [Missing validation] Does the constructor validate that indexer_api_port is in a valid range (1-65535) and not a privileged port (1-1024) that requires root? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: IndexerApiManager::new()] [URL validation bypass] If existing_hasura_url is provided, is it validated to be a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL, or can attacker provide file://, ftp://, or other schemes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: new()] [Postgres connection string validation] Is the postgres_connection_string validated to be a proper PostgreSQL connection URI, or can it contain shell metacharacters that get executed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: get_prerequisite_health_checkers()] [Prerequisite bypass] Can prerequisite health checkers be satisfied by an attacker before the actual prerequisites (like postgres) are truly ready, causing connection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: get_health_checkers() - IndexerApiMetadata] [Metadata health timing] Is there a race condition where the health checker confirms metadata is applied, but it gets reset or overwritten immediately after? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - Config] [TTY allocation risk] The config sets tty: Some(true) - does this create security risks like allowing interactive access to the container or bypassing certain security restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - HostConfig] [Volume mount missing] The container has no explicit volume mounts - could this cause Hasura to write metadata to container filesystem, losing data on restart or creating security isolation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - HostConfig] [Resource limits] Does the HostConfig set CPU, memory, or disk I/O limits to prevent the Hasura container from consuming excessive host resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - HostConfig] [Security options missing] Are Docker security options like seccomp profiles, AppArmor, or SELinux contexts configured to restrict container capabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - env configuration] [Hasura admin secret] No HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET is set in the environment - does this leave the Hasura GraphQL API completely unauthenticated and open to anyone who can reach the port? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - env configuration] [Console asset security] The HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONSOLE_ASSETS_DIR points to bundled assets - could a compromised Hasura image contain malicious JavaScript in these assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - env configuration] [Server port mismatch] HASURA_GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT is set to indexer_api_port - if these don't match the exposed_ports configuration, could this cause port confusion or bypass firewall rules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/indexer_api.rs] [Function: run_service() - connection string replacement] [Hardcoded IP replacement] The hardcoded check for '127.0.0.1' doesn't handle 'localhost' or other loopback representations - could this cause connection failures or security bypasses?
