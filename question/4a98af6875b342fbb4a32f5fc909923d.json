  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malformed BCS-encoded bytes that cause bcs::from_bytes() to panic or consume excessive memory, potentially crashing indexer nodes processing event data and causing API unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit BCS deserialization to inject mismatched types that pass bcs::from_bytes() but violate CollectionMutation invariants, leading to state inconsistencies when the event is processed by indexers or translators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does BCS deserialization validate string length prefixes to prevent integer overflows when allocating memory for mutated_field_name, old_value, or new_value strings that could crash event processors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Recursive deserialization] Can nested or recursive BCS structures in the Object field cause stack overflow during deserialization, allowing DoS attacks against nodes processing CollectionMutation events?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: mutated_field_name] [Field name spoofing] Can an attacker set mutated_field_name to arbitrary values not matching actual collection fields (e.g., 'balance', 'admin'), tricking indexers or applications into misinterpreting which field was mutated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: mutated_field_name] [Empty field name] Is there validation preventing empty strings in mutated_field_name, or can events be created with '' causing indexing failures or application logic errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Object validation] Does the Object field validate that it references an actual Collection resource on-chain, or can attackers emit events referencing non-existent, deleted, or wrong-type objects causing translator failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Cross-collection spoofing] Can an attacker emit a CollectionMutation event for Collection A but set the collection field to Collection B, creating false mutation history that could be exploited in marketplace verification or provenance tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Object type confusion] Does the code validate that the Object::inner() address points to a 0x4::collection::Collection resource, or can events reference token objects, accounts, or other types causing type confusion in event translators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Duplicate events] Can multiple CollectionMutation events be emitted for the same collection and mutation in a single transaction, causing duplicate entries in indexers and breaking event ordering guarantees?
