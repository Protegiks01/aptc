  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_block_info_by_height()] [Height Mapping] If multiple blocks have the same height due to a bug, which one is returned, and can this cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_block_info_by_height()] [Height Overflow] Can BlockHeight overflow if the chain runs for an extremely long time, causing height-based queries to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_last_version_before_timestamp()] [Timestamp Ordering] If blocks are committed with non-monotonic timestamps, can this return the wrong version, breaking time-based queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_last_version_before_timestamp()] [Future Timestamp] If no blocks exist at or after the required timestamp, does this error correctly, or can it return an invalid version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_last_version_before_timestamp()] [Ledger Version Check] If ledger_version is stale when querying, can this return a version > ledger_version causing consistency violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_epoch_state()] [Epoch Transition Race] Can this return stale EpochState if called during an epoch transition, causing validators to use incorrect validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_epoch_state()] [Validator Set Integrity] Can the returned EpochState have inconsistent validator voting power or cryptographic keys due to partial writes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Prefix Validation] Can an attacker use an empty StateKeyPrefix to iterate over the entire state, causing DoS through excessive database reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Cursor Manipulation] Can a malicious cursor parameter cause the iterator to skip entries or return duplicates, breaking pagination logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Version Consistency] If the iterator reads from version V but state is modified, can this return inconsistent state where some values are from V and others from V+1? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_prefixed_state_value_iterator()] [Access Control] Can this be used to read state from privileged accounts without proper permission checks, leaking sensitive data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_ledger_info_option()] [Signature Verification] Can the returned LedgerInfoWithSignatures contain invalid signatures that weren't properly verified during storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_ledger_info_option()] [Concurrent Commit] If this returns Some(ledger_info) but a commit is in progress, can the ledger_info be from a partially committed state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_synced_version()] [Version Consistency] Can synced_version > committed_version, and if so, can this cause validators to execute transactions before they're properly certified? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_synced_version()] [Rollback Handling] If a rollback occurs, is synced_version properly decremented, or can it remain at a higher value causing incorrect state queries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_pre_committed_version()] [Pre-commit Safety] Can pre-committed transactions be read before they're validated by consensus, allowing execution of malicious transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_pre_committed_version()] [Version Drift] If pre_committed_version - committed_version is very large, can this indicate a stalled consensus or DoS attack? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_state_checkpoint_version()] [Checkpoint Consistency] Can the checkpoint version point to a state that doesn't match the committed ledger state due to crash recovery issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_latest_state_checkpoint_version()] [Checkpoint Frequency] If checkpoints are created too infrequently, can this return None causing state sync to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_before()] [Snapshot Selection] Can this return a snapshot at version V where V >= next_version, violating the 'strictly before' constraint? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_before()] [Hash Verification] Can the returned HashValue be from a different snapshot version than claimed, causing state sync to download incorrect state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/lib.rs] [Function: get_account_ordered_transaction()] [Sequence Number Collision] If two transactions have the same sequence number due to a bug, which one is returned, and can this enable replay attacks? (Critical)",
