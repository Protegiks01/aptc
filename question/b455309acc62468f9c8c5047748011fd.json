  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Function: inc_and_check_delayed_fields_count()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow in delayed_fields_count by repeatedly incrementing it beyond usize::MAX, bypassing the MAX_DELAYED_FIELDS_PER_RESOURCE limit and enabling unlimited delayed fields per resource? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/value_serde.rs] [Constant: MAX_DELAYED_FIELDS_PER_RESOURCE] [Resource Exhaustion] Is the hardcoded limit of 10 delayed fields per resource sufficient to prevent state bloat attacks where an attacker creates resources with maximum delayed fields to exhaust storage and gas metering? (High)",
