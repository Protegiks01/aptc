  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: old_id(), new_id()] [TokenId Cloning] Returning &TokenId allows access to nested TokenDataId with mutable strings - can this enable modification of supposedly immutable token identifiers through unsafe operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Replay Protection] Does MutatePropertyMap include any nonce or sequence number to prevent replay attacks where the same mutation event is emitted multiple times, causing duplicate property updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Timestamp Absence] Without a timestamp field, can events be reordered maliciously, causing mutations to be applied out-of-order and resulting in incorrect final property states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Transaction Context] Can an attacker emit multiple MutatePropertyMap events in a single transaction with conflicting mutations, causing ambiguous final states where it's unclear which mutation should be applied last? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Cross-Transaction Ordering] If two transactions in the same block emit conflicting MutatePropertyMap events for the same token, how is ordering determined? Can transaction ordering manipulation cause front-running of property mutations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: new()] [Signer Verification] Does new() perform any validation that the caller is authorized to mutate the token identified by old_id? Can any account create mutation events for tokens they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: account] [Owner Validation] Is there validation that the account field matches the actual token owner or creator? Can attackers set account to an arbitrary address to make mutations appear to come from legitimate owners? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Capability Requirements] Does emitting a MutatePropertyMap event require specific Move capabilities (e.g., MutateTokenPropertiesCapability)? Can the event be emitted without proper authorization, bypassing access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Creator Authorization] Can an account other than the token creator emit mutation events, or is there enforcement that only creators can mutate properties, preventing unauthorized property modifications? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information Disclosure] Does the Debug trait implementation expose sensitive data when MutatePropertyMap is logged or printed in error messages, potentially leaking private property values to log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Panic Safety] If any getter methods panic (e.g., due to corrupted internal state), can this cause validator node crashes during event processing, disrupting consensus liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error Propagation] Does the anyhow::Result error type properly propagate all BCS deserialization errors, or are some errors silently converted, hiding potential exploitation attempts in error logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Drop Trait] Is there a custom Drop implementation that ensures cleanup of vectors? Can interrupted event processing leave dangling allocations that accumulate over time in validator memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Event Handler Assumptions] Do downstream event handlers (indexers, APIs) assume keys.len() == values.len() == types.len()? Can violating this assumption cause indexer crashes, data corruption, or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Move VM Integration] Does the Move VM validate MutatePropertyMap events match the actual property mutations performed? Can events lie about mutations without detection, causing state divergence between chain state and event logs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Static: MUTATE_PROPERTY_MAP_TYPE] [Type Registry] Is MUTATE_PROPERTY_MAP_TYPE registered in a global type registry? Can type registration conflicts cause events to be misinterpreted as different types, leading to deserialization into wrong structs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Version Migration] If MoveEventV2Type is upgraded to V3, how are existing MutatePropertyMap events migrated? Can version mismatches cause events to be dropped or misinterpreted, losing critical property mutation history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: old_id, new_id] [Property Version Increment] Does the event enforce that new_id.property_version == old_id.property_version + 1, or can arbitrary version jumps occur, breaking the invariant that property versions are strictly increasing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: keys, values, types] [Property Type Consistency] Can properties change types between mutations (e.g., 'level' changing from u64 to String)? Does the event validate type consistency, or can type changes corrupt property map semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Immutable Property Protection] Does the event allow mutation of properties marked as immutable in the TokenData? Can attackers bypass immutability by emitting mutation events for protected properties? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Struct: MutatePropertyMap] [Property Count Limits] Are there limits on the maximum number of properties (keys.len())? Can attackers create tokens with millions of properties through unbounded mutations, causing storage exhaustion and indexer performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty Vectors] Can new() be called with all empty vectors (keys=[], values=[], types=[]), creating a no-op mutation event? Does this waste gas and pollute event logs without performing actual mutations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_property_map.rs] [Field: keys] [Unicode Normalization] Are keys compared using Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD)?
