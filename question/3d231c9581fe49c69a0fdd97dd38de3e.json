  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: ShellSafeName] [Period exploitation] Multiple consecutive periods are allowed ('a..b') - can this enable directory traversal when combined with path joining operations in implementors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: TextLine] [Empty line handling] TextLine::new() allows empty strings (length 0) which become just '\\\\n' - can empty metadata lines cause parsing ambiguities or be used to inject delimiter confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Struct: TextLine] [Whitespace preservation] Does TextLine preserve leading/trailing whitespace, or can trimming operations cause metadata fields to merge or become indistinguishable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Type alias: BackupHandleRef] [Reference aliasing] BackupHandleRef is just &str - can aliasing allow modification of the underlying string through unsafe code or interior mutability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Type alias: FileHandleRef] [Lifetime elision] FileHandleRef references don't encode lifetimes - can this cause use-after-free bugs when handles outlive their backing storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Missing cleanup method] The trait has no cleanup/shutdown method - can leaked resources (open files, connections) accumulate during long-running backup operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Error propagation] Methods return anyhow::Result - does this mask critical errors that should cause backup abortion versus transient errors that can be retried? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Cancellation safety] Async methods have no explicit cancellation handling - if backup operations are cancelled mid-flight, can this leave partial state that corrupts future operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Transaction semantics missing] The trait provides no BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK primitives - can failures during multi-file backup leave inconsistent state where some files are written and others aren't? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Consistency between metadata and data] If save_metadata_lines() succeeds but corresponding create_for_write() fails, can manifest point to non-existent files causing restore failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Eventual consistency vulnerability] For distributed storage backends (S3, GCS), are reads after writes consistent, or can restore operations read stale/incomplete data due to eventual consistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Checkpoint atomicity] Can backup_metadata_file() be used to implement checkpoints, or does lack of atomicity mean checkpoints can be partially applied, causing ambiguous restore points? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Concurrent operation limits] Are there limits on concurrent calls to create_for_write() or open_for_read(), or can unbounded parallelism exhaust file descriptors or network connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Timeout handling] Do async operations have timeouts, or can hung storage operations block backup indefinitely, preventing timely disaster recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Buffering strategy] AsyncRead/AsyncWrite returned by methods - what buffering strategy is used? Can unbuffered I/O cause excessive syscalls degrading backup performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Memory mapping risks] Do implementations use memory-mapped files, and if so, can SIGBUS on corrupted files crash the backup process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Encryption missing] The trait provides no encryption primitives - are backups stored in plaintext allowing attackers with storage access to steal private keys and validator credentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Authentication missing] No authentication methods exist - can unauthorized parties create, modify, or delete backups if they can access the storage backend? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Integrity verification] Without checksums or signatures in the trait, can corrupted or tampered backup files be detected before they're used for restoration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Replay protection] Can attackers replay old backups to restore the chain to a previous state, enabling double-spending or governance attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Type alias: FileHandle] [Predictable file names] If FileHandles use sequential or predictable naming, can attackers enumerate and access all backups to reconstruct complete blockchain history? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Audit logging missing] The trait has no logging or audit trail capabilities - can attackers perform malicious backup operations without leaving forensic evidence? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Access control delegation] Implementations may use IAM roles or credentials - are these validated and rotated, or can leaked credentials grant persistent access to backup storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Trait: BackupStorage] [Data residency] For cloud storage, can data be backed up to regions with adverse legal jurisdictions, exposing node operators to legal risks or data subpoenas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/mod.rs] [Cfg attribute: test] [Test code in production] Multiple #[cfg(test)] blocks at lines 8, 21, 92, 124 - can these be accidentally compiled into production builds exposing test functionality? (Low)"
