  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious node_config_path containing '../' sequences to read arbitrary files outside the intended config directory, potentially accessing validator keys or sensitive system files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Symbolic Link Attack] Does the config loader follow symbolic links, allowing an attacker to point node_config_path to a symlink that redirects to a malicious config file or sensitive data, enabling config injection or information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where the config file could be modified between loading at line 74 and execution config loading at line 78, allowing an attacker to inject malicious configuration after validation? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Order Dependency] Does the specific ordering of operations (load config, load execution, set data dir, optimize, sanitize) create vulnerabilities where early steps can be exploited before later security checks are applied? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Error Handling Bypass] If NodeConfig::load_config() at line 74 returns an error, does the error message leak sensitive path information or system details that could aid further attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Incomplete Sanitization] Between lines 74-87, multiple operations occur before sanitization at line 87 - can an attacker craft configs that exploit these intermediate states before security hardening is applied?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [State Inconsistency] If optimize_and_sanitize_node_config() at line 87 fails partway through, is the node left in an inconsistent state with partially applied configs that could cause consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: load_and_sanitize_config()] [Panic-Based DoS] Can specially crafted config files cause panics during deserialization or validation that crash the node, preventing it from participating in consensus and reducing network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Privilege Escalation] Can a malicious actor craft a node config that passes validator role checks at line 41 but actually operates as a fullnode, bypassing validator-specific security controls and potentially joining the validator set unauthorized? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Node Type Spoofing] Can an attacker create a config with RoleType::FullNode but inject validator-specific network configs to be misclassified as a ValidatorFullnode at lines 47-52, gaining unauthorized access to VFN networks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [VFN Network Detection Bypass] At lines 47-50, the code checks for VFN networks using is_vfn_network() - can an attacker manipulate network_id fields to spoof VFN detection and elevate a PFN to VFN privileges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Empty Network List Attack] If full_node_networks is empty at line 47, does the node default to PublicFullnode at line 54, and could this be exploited to downgrade security assumptions for nodes that should be VFNs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Multiple VFN Networks] If an attacker provides multiple network configs where some are VFN and some are public, does the any() check at line 50 correctly handle this, or could mixed configs cause security violations?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Role Type Confusion] Does the role check at line 41 properly validate all possible RoleType variants, or are there edge cases where undefined or future role types could bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_config_loader.rs] [Function: extract_from_config()] [Config Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker provide a serialized config where base.role and full_node_networks contradict each other, causing inconsistent node type detection across different code paths?
