  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Referenced: num_bigint] [BigUint timing] The test uses num_bigint::BigUint for scalar generation - does this library have constant-time guarantees for set_bit and to_bytes_le operations? Could timing leaks in BigUint operations contaminate the test? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Referenced: group::Group trait] [Trait implementation timing] Does the Group::random() trait method used to generate random G1 points have constant-time implementation? Could non-constant-time random point generation affect test validity when random_bases=true? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Line 7: Note comment] [Incomplete documentation] The comment states 'This runs the fixed base test. You'd need another Rust file to run the random base test' - does this lack of clear guidance lead to incomplete deployment where validators only test fixed-base operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Example file location] [Discoverability] Being located in 'examples/' rather than 'tests/' or integrated into CI, is this constant-time verification discoverable by security auditors and mandatory for deployment validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Minimal code] [Lack of assertions] The example file contains no explicit assertions or validation logic - does this make it unclear what 'passing' means, and can the test silently fail without proper interpretation of the t-statistic output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Timing attack focus] [Non-timing side channels] While validating constant-time execution, does the example miss other side channels like electromagnetic emanations, acoustic cryptanalysis, or fault injection attacks on the same scalar multiplication operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Scalar multiplication only] [Protocol-level timing] Does testing only low-level scalar multiplication miss protocol-level timing attacks where the overall VUF eval time leaks information through network timing, even if individual operations are constant-time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/examples/is_blstrs_constant_time.rs] [Production validation] [Deployment verification gap] Can an attacker compromise the deployment process to skip this constant-time check or replace it with a no-op, deploying vulnerable validators that leak VUF keys without detection? (High)"
