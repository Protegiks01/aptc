  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Schema version] Are TransactionAccumulatorSchema and DbMetadataSchema versioned, and can schema version mismatches cause pruning operations to interpret data incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Write amplification] Does the pruning algorithm cause excessive write amplification by repeatedly updating nearby positions, potentially degrading RocksDB performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Progress visibility] After updating DbMetadataKey::TransactionAccumulatorPrunerProgress, is the new progress immediately visible to other threads/processes reading from the database, or can stale progress values be read? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Checkpoint consistency] If a database checkpoint is taken while TransactionAccumulatorPruner is executing write_schemas(), can the checkpoint contain a partially pruned accumulator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: new()] [Metadata staleness] Can get_or_initialize_subpruner_progress return stale cached metadata that doesn't reflect recent progress updates, causing the pruner to re-prune versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Proof security] After pruning, can an attacker who knows deleted node hashes forge proofs for non-existent transactions, or does the remaining accumulator structure prevent this? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Hash collision] If two different accumulator node contents hash to the same value (due to collision), can pruning delete one while keeping the other, breaking proof verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/pruner/ledger_pruner/transaction_accumulator_pruner.rs] [Function: prune()] [Sibling hash] Does the pruning algorithm ensure that when deleting a node, its sibling needed for proofs is preserved, or can it delete both siblings leaving gaps in the proof path? (High)"
