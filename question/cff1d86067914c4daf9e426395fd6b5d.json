  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error variants] [Information Leakage] Can an attacker exploit the String parameters in error variants (lines 10, 13, 16, 19, etc.) to extract sensitive internal state information such as validator identities, block hashes, or network topology by triggering specific error conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::InvalidMessageError] [Message Validation Bypass] Can an attacker craft malicious consensus observer messages that bypass validation in verify_ordered_blocks(), verify_ordered_proof(), or verify_payload_digests() by exploiting incomplete error checking, allowing invalid blocks or proofs to be accepted as valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::InvalidMessageError] [Consensus Safety Violation] Can a Byzantine validator send crafted messages that trigger InvalidMessageError (line 10) but still cause state corruption before the error is properly handled, potentially breaking consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::NetworkError] [Network Partition Attack] Can an attacker manipulate NetworkError conditions (line 13) to cause observers to incorrectly disconnect from honest validators while maintaining connections to Byzantine nodes, enabling targeted network partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::ObserverFallingBehind] [Liveness Attack] Can a malicious publisher intentionally trigger ObserverFallingBehind errors (line 16) by withholding blocks or sending them out of order, causing observers to repeatedly reset subscriptions and never catch up with the chain? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::ObserverProgressStopped] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker force observers into ObserverProgressStopped state (line 19) by manipulating block timestamps or round numbers, causing permanent loss of liveness for all consensus observers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::RpcError] [Error Conversion Attack] Does the automatic conversion from RpcError (line 22) properly preserve all security-relevant error context, or can attackers exploit error conversion to downgrade critical network failures into benign errors that aren't properly handled? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::SubscriptionDisconnected] [Subscription Manipulation] Can Byzantine validators trigger SubscriptionDisconnected errors (line 25) at critical moments (e.g., during epoch transitions or block commits) to prevent observers from witnessing valid consensus decisions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Enum: Error::SubscriptionProgressStopped] [State Inconsistency] Can an attacker exploit SubscriptionProgressStopped errors (line 28) to cause observers to accept stale or forked chain state by manipulating the progress detection logic?

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Metric Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the static string labels returned by get_label() (lines 47-57) to manipulate consensus observer metrics, causing operators to make incorrect decisions about node health or network status? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Error Classification Attack] Does get_label() properly distinguish between benign transient errors and critical security violations, or can attackers trigger high-severity errors that are logged with innocuous labels like 'network_error', hiding malicious activity? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Observability Bypass] Can Byzantine validators trigger errors that return generic labels (lines 48-57) to evade monitoring and alerting systems designed to detect consensus attacks or validator misbehavior? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Label Inconsistency] Are the error labels (lines 47-57) used consistently across all consensus observer components, or can label mismatches cause incorrect error categorization that breaks alerting or recovery logic?
