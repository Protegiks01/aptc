  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: ModuleTestPlan::new()] [String ownership] The module_name parameter at line 83 is &str but gets to_owned() at line 87 - can this string conversion introduce security issues with invalid UTF-8, or can the owned string be manipulated after Identifier creation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Dependency trust] The code depends on move_core_types and move_binary_format crates - can vulnerabilities in those dependencies (e.g., in CompiledModule, MoveValue, StatusCode) propagate through this testing infrastructure to affect Aptos security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: fmt::Display] [Pattern matching safety] The match statements at lines 150-166 for StatusCode - are all StatusCode variants handled, or can new variants be added that fall through to default cases with less secure error formatting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: fmt::Display] [Conditional logic] The if statements at lines 168-179 have complex conditionals checking status type - can logical errors in these conditions cause incorrect error messages that hide security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: ExpectedMoveErrorDisplay] [Reference validity] The ExpectedMoveErrorDisplay holds a reference to ExpectedMoveError at line 76 - can this reference become invalid during formatting if the underlying error is moved or dropped, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Module isolation] Can tests from different modules interfere with each other if they share ModuleIds or if the test execution environment doesn't properly isolate module state between test runs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: TestPlan::new()] [Iterator safety] The into_iter() calls at lines 101, 106, 118 consume the collections - can this lead to double-free or use-after-free if the original collections are accessed afterwards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: TestPlan::new()] [Filter_map side effects] The filter_map closure at lines 107-116 accesses annot_module multiple times - can side effects or panics within this closure corrupt the resulting module_info map? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: TestPlan::new()] [Map construction] The map() call at line 119 creates tuples for BTreeMap - can key duplication at this stage cause data loss where the last module overwrites earlier ones with the same ID? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestPlan] [Field initialization order] The TestPlan struct is constructed at lines 124-128 - can incorrect initialization order cause fields to reference invalid data or cause use-before-init issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: ExpectedMoveError::verbiage()] [Boolean flag] The is_past_tense parameter at line 133 controls formatting - can this flag be manipulated to generate inconsistent error messages that confuse security analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Type alias safety] The TestName type alias at line 19 is just String - can using raw Strings without newtype wrappers lead to confusion where non-test strings are used as test names, causing security checks to be bypassed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: ExpectedMoveError] [Tuple struct] ExpectedMoveError is a tuple struct (line 62) with public fields - can direct field access bypass validation logic that should check field consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: PartialEq for ExpectedMoveError] [Equality semantics] The custom PartialEq at lines 69-72 ignores field 3 (error message) - can this cause HashSet or HashMap deduplication to incorrectly merge distinct errors, hiding multiple security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Import security] The imports at lines 5-14 bring in external types - can malicious implementations of AccountAddress, Identifier, or ModuleId exploit this testing infrastructure through trait implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Module: filter_test_members] [Submodule trust] The submodule at line 17 is declared but not shown - can vulnerabilities in filter_test_members affect test execution by incorrectly filtering out security-critical tests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: fmt::Display] [String concatenation] Multiple write!() calls at lines 151-185 build up the error message - can excessive string concatenation cause performance issues or memory exhaustion with long error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: fmt::Display] [Error propagation] The write!() calls return Result<(), fmt::Error> - can formatting errors be silently ignored with the ? operator, causing incomplete error messages that hide security details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Struct size] Are there any size constraints on TestPlan or ModuleTestPlan? Can extremely large test plans with thousands of modules cause stack overflow when passed by value or cloned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Function: ModuleTestPlan::new()] [AccountAddress construction] AccountAddress::new() at line 86 takes bytes - can malformed byte arrays (wrong length, invalid format) cause panics or undefined behavior in address construction? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Copy trait] None of the structs implement Copy - can this lead to unintended moves that invalidate references or cause use-after-move bugs in calling code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: NamedOrBytecodeModule] [Enum size] Can the size difference between Named (large NamedCompiledModule) and Bytecode (CompiledModule) variants cause memory inefficiency or alignment issues when stored in vectors or maps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Panic safety] Multiple unwrap() calls throughout - are all panics properly handled by calling code, or can test infrastructure panics bring down validator nodes during test execution? (High)",
