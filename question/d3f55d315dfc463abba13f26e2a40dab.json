  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Metrics: Label injection] Can peer_network_id values be crafted to inject special characters into metric labels, causing metric namespace pollution or confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Metrics: Cardinality explosion] Could unlimited unique peer_network_id values cause unbounded metric cardinality growth, exhausting monitoring system resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Metrics: Update race condition] Can concurrent calls to update_peer_state_metrics() for the same peer cause metric value corruption or lost updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Memory: State accumulation] Can monitoring state accumulate unboundedly if peers are added but never removed, causing memory exhaustion over time? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Memory: Large response handling] If monitoring service responses contain large data structures (e.g., long peer lists), could this cause memory spikes or OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Resource: Request tracker leak] Can RequestTracker Arc references leak if peer states are not properly cleaned up on disconnection, causing unbounded Arc reference count growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Serialization: State persistence] If PeerStateValue is serialized and deserialized, could Arc<RwLock> references be incorrectly restored causing shared state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Test leak: Mock TimeService] If TimeService::mock() is accidentally used in production instead of TimeService::real(), could this allow time manipulation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/client/src/peer_states/key_value.rs] [Test leak: Test configs] Could test-only configuration values leak into production, disabling critical monitoring or setting unsafe thresholds? (High)"
