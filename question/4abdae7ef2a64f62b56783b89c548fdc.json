  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: helpers] [Access Control] Why is the helpers module declared as private (line 8) while all cryptographic modules are public - could this create inconsistent security boundaries where helper functions used internally lack the same validation as public APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Architecture] Does the flat module structure (all modules at same level, lines 4-13) allow for improper cross-module dependencies where low-level cryptographic primitives could be misused by higher-level modules without proper validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: algebra] [Missing Validation] Is the algebra module (line 4) properly isolated from direct Move VM access, or could malicious Move code invoke algebraic operations that bypass signature validation in other modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: bls12381] [Cryptographic Primitive] Does the public exposure of bls12381 (line 5) allow Move contracts to perform arbitrary BLS operations that could be used to forge validator signatures or manipulate consensus voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: bulletproofs] [Zero-Knowledge Proof] Are bulletproofs operations (line 6) properly gas-metered, or could attackers craft expensive proof verification calls that cause validator nodes to slow down or halt? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: ed25519] [Signature Verification] Does the ed25519 module (line 7) enforce proper public key validation before signature verification, or could malformed keys lead to signature verification bypasses in transaction validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: multi_ed25519] [Multi-Signature] Can the multi_ed25519 module (line 9) be exploited to create quorum bypass attacks where fewer than required signatures are accepted due to threshold validation errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: ristretto255] [Elliptic Curve] Are ristretto255 operations (line 10) protected against small subgroup attacks, or could attackers exploit the curve to extract private keys or forge signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: secp256k1] [ECDSA] Does the secp256k1 module (line 13) properly validate k-values in ECDSA signatures to prevent nonce reuse attacks that could reveal private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Exports] [Type Confusion] Could the separation of ristretto255, ristretto255_point, and ristretto255_scalar (lines 10-12) lead to type confusion attacks where points are treated as scalars or vice versa, breaking cryptographic invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Dependencies] [Circular Reference] Is there risk of circular dependencies between these cryptographic modules that could create initialization ordering vulnerabilities or unsafe static initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Isolation] [Side Channel] Do all public modules (lines 4-13) properly protect against timing side-channels, or could response time differences in different cryptographic operations leak sensitive validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Missing Primitives] [Protocol Vulnerability] Are critical cryptographic primitives missing from this module declaration (such as VRF for leader election, threshold cryptography for DKG, or hash-to-curve for BLS) that could force insecure workarounds elsewhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Organization] [Gas Metering] Does the flat module structure ensure that all cryptographic operations are consistently gas-metered, or could some module paths bypass gas accounting leading to DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Public API Surface] [Attack Surface] Does exposing 9 different cryptographic modules publicly (lines 4-13 excluding helpers) create an unnecessarily large attack surface where only a subset should be directly callable from Move? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: helpers] [Code Reuse] Does the private helpers module (line 8) contain security-critical validation logic that should actually be duplicated in each cryptographic module to prevent single-point-of-failure bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module: helpers] [Visibility] Should helper functions be public to allow security auditors to verify their correctness, or does keeping them private (line 8) prevent external validation of critical utility functions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Interaction] [Signature Malleability] Can attackers exploit interactions between ed25519 (line 7) and multi_ed25519 (line 9) to create malleable signatures that verify under both schemes, breaking transaction uniqueness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Interaction] [Curve Mixing] Could mixing operations between secp256k1 (line 13) and ristretto255 (lines 10-12) lead to cross-curve attacks where keys from one curve are validated against another? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Module Coordination] [State Corruption] Is there shared mutable state between these modules that could be corrupted by race conditions when multiple cryptographic operations execute concurrently in the VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Missing Module] [Randomness] Is secure randomness generation missing from module declarations, forcing insecure randomness implementations in upper layers that could compromise validator selection or cryptographic nonces? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Missing Module] [Hash Functions] Are cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2, etc.) missing from this module structure, and if so, where are they implemented and are they properly integrated with gas metering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Missing Module] [Key Derivation] Is there a secure key derivation function (KDF) module for deriving child keys from master keys, or could improper key derivation in other modules lead to related-key attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/mod.rs] [Missing Module] [Constant-Time Operations] Are constant-time comparison and arithmetic operations provided as a separate module, or could timing-variable operations in individual modules leak secrets? (High)"
