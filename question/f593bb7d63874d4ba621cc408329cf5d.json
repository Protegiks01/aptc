  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes with extremely large String fields (collection, token, old_uri, new_uri) exceeding available memory, causing validator nodes to crash or become unresponsive when deserializing UriMutation events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization DoS] Does try_from_bytes() impose any size limits on the input byte array, or can an attacker submit gigabytes of malformed BCS data causing CPU exhaustion during deserialization attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can malicious BCS bytes be crafted to deserialize into a UriMutation struct with mismatched type tags, causing type safety violations when the event is processed by indexers or APIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] If the BCS encoding specifies string lengths that overflow usize when deserialized, can this cause memory corruption or panics in the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Malformed UTF-8] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes containing invalid UTF-8 sequences in the String fields that pass BCS deserialization but cause panics or undefined behavior when accessed by getter methods? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Duplicate field injection] Can malicious BCS encoding include duplicate fields or extra fields beyond the 5 expected struct members, potentially causing state inconsistency if not properly validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error propagation] Does the anyhow error handling in try_from_bytes() expose internal system information or memory addresses in error messages that could aid attacker reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Recursive deserialization] Can nested or recursive BCS structures be injected to cause stack overflow during deserialization, crashing validator nodes processing UriMutation events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Determinism violation] If BCS deserialization produces different results on different validator nodes (due to platform differences or BCS library versions), can this cause consensus divergence when events are translated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Canonical encoding bypass] Can an attacker craft non-canonical BCS encodings that deserialize successfully but produce different hash values, allowing event replay or duplication attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Struct: UriMutation] [Unbounded strings] Since collection, token, old_uri, and new_uri are unbounded String types, can an attacker emit events with multi-gigabyte string values causing storage exhaustion and indexer failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [String injection] Can an attacker inject special characters, control characters, or null bytes in the collection string field to exploit downstream parsers, indexers, or API consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: token] [Unicode normalization] If the token field contains non-normalized Unicode strings, can two visually identical token names produce different hashes, enabling token identity confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: old_uri] [URI scheme validation] Is there any validation that old_uri contains a valid URI scheme, or can arbitrary strings be stored potentially causing security issues in applications that blindly trust and dereference these URIs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: new_uri] [Cross-site scripting] Can an attacker set new_uri to contain JavaScript code or data URIs that execute malicious scripts when displayed by frontends or wallets consuming this event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: collection] [Empty string handling] What happens if collection, token, or URI fields are empty strings? Can this cause indexing errors, key collisions, or break assumptions in event translation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: token] [Whitespace manipulation] Can leading/trailing whitespace or internal whitespace sequences in token names cause identifier confusion when matching tokens across events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: old_uri] [URI length limits] Are there any practical limits on URI length enforced by the Move contract, or can events reference URIs exceeding HTTP header limits causing failures in metadata fetching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: new_uri] [SSRF potential] Can malicious new_uri values pointing to internal network addresses (localhost, 169.254.x.x, private IPs) cause server-side request forgery when indexers or applications fetch metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [All String fields] [Memory aliasing] Since getter methods return &String references, can concurrent modifications (if any unsafe code exists) lead to data races or use-after-free vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: creator] [Zero address] Can an attacker create UriMutation events with creator set to the zero address (0x0), potentially bypassing ownership checks or causing null pointer-like behavior in downstream code? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Function: creator()] [Reference lifetime] Does the reference returned by creator() have proper lifetime bounds, or can it outlive the UriMutation struct causing use-after-free in unsafe contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/uri_mutation.rs] [Field: creator] [Address format validation] Are there any checks that creator is a valid 32-byte account address, or can malformed addresses cause issues in address-to-string conversions? (Low)",
