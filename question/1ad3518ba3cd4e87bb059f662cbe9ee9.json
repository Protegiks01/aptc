  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Deserialize::deserialize()] [Serde format confusion] Can attackers exploit differences between JSON, BSON, MessagePack, or other serde formats to cause the same Address to deserialize differently depending on wire format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Function: Serialize::serialize()] [Serializer state corruption] Can bugs in custom Serializer implementations cause Address serialization to corrupt serializer state, affecting subsequent serialization of other fields? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Struct: Address] [Optimization instability] Can aggressive compiler optimizations miscompile Address operations (especially with Copy trait) in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities in release builds but not debug builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Struct: Address] [Alignment issues] Does the single-field struct wrapping AccountAddress have alignment or padding issues that could cause memory corruption on certain platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Dependency: AccountAddress] [Upstream vulnerability] If the underlying aptos_types::account_address::AccountAddress has vulnerabilities, does this wrapper provide any additional validation or safety, or does it blindly expose all upstream issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Dependency: serde] [Serde CVE exposure] Are there known CVEs in the serde version being used that could affect Address serialization/deserialization, enabling injection or DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/address.rs] [Dependency: anyhow] [Error handling bypass] Can bugs in anyhow's error formatting or propagation allow error conditions to be silently ignored, permitting invalid addresses to pass validation? (Medium)"
