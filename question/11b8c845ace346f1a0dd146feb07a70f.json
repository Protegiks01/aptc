  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Generator security] If the base point is not a generator of the full group (e.g., generates a small subgroup), can this reduce the security of commitments and enable discrete log attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: dst()] [Context separation] The DST doesn't include session-specific context (e.g., epoch number, validator set). Can this allow cross-session proof replay in scenarios where the same base/ell are reused? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Commitment malleability] Can an attacker find two different chunk representations that unchunk to the same scalar, allowing commitment malleability without breaking binding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Trait: fixed_base_msms::Trait] [Batch verification bypass] Can an attacker craft MSM inputs that cause batch verification optimizations to incorrectly accept invalid commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Memory leak] Do the vectors allocated in msm_terms get properly deallocated if an error occurs during processing, or can repeated failures cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Struct: CodomainShape] [Clone efficiency] Does PartialEq (line 28, 35) clone large curve points during comparison, causing unnecessary allocations and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: EntrywiseMap::map()] [Closure capture] If the closure F in map() captures large data structures, can this cause excessive memory usage during transformation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: into_iter()] [Premature collection] The flatten().collect() pattern (line 69) eagerly collects all elements. For large CodomainShapes, can this cause temporary memory doubling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Test: test_chunked_homomorphism_ell_16] [Test inadequacy] The test only covers ell=16 and 8 scalars. Can vulnerabilities exist for other ell values (8, 32, 64) or extreme scalar counts (1, 1000+)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Test: test_chunked_homomorphism_ell_16] [Malicious input testing] The test uses random inputs but doesn't test adversarial cases (e.g., all-zero scalars, maximum scalars, special curve points). Can these expose vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Test: test_chunked_homomorphism_ell_16] [Concurrent testing] Does the test verify thread safety of Homomorphism operations, or can race conditions exist in production that aren't caught by tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Test: test_chunked_homomorphism_ell_16] [Error path coverage] The test doesn't cover error cases (e.g., MSM failure, invalid inputs). Can error handling bugs exist that aren't detected by passing tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: msm_eval()] [Subgroup attack] If the MSM produces a point in a small cofactor subgroup (e.g., for BLS12-381's G2), can this leak information about the scalar or enable small-subgroup attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: apply()] [Point decompression] If the base point requires decompression from affine coordinates, can invalid decompression (e.g., choosing wrong y-coordinate) cause security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Struct: Homomorphism] [Twist attack] Can an attacker substitute the base point with a point on the curve's twist, causing the discrete log problem to become easier? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Scalar normalization] Does le_chunks_to_scalar ensure that reconstructed scalars are in canonical form (0 <= s < field modulus), or can non-canonical representations break commitment uniqueness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: apply()] [Pairing compatibility] If the Homomorphism is used in pairing-based protocols (e.g., for verification), can group element mismatches between G1/G2 cause verification failures or security issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Function: msm_terms()] [Chunk count validation] Does the code validate that the number of chunks matches the expected value for given ell and field size, or can mismatched chunk counts cause incorrect reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/chunky/chunked_scalar_mul.rs] [Struct: Witness] [Dimensional consistency] Are the dimensions of chunked_values validated (e.g., all rows have same length), or can inconsistent dimensions cause index errors? (High)",
