  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Duration overflow attack] Can an attacker pass Duration::MAX or an extremely large duration value, causing state sync to hang indefinitely or trigger integer overflow in duration calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_to_target()] [Merkle root forgery] Does the LedgerInfoWithSignatures target get validated against state sync's local merkle tree, or can an attacker provide a target with incorrect transaction accumulator root to corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Callback drop attack] If the callback oneshot::Receiver is dropped before state sync responds, does consensus properly handle the RecvError, or does it assume success, potentially causing committed transactions to be lost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: respond_to_commit_notification()] [Double response exploit] Can state sync call respond_to_commit_notification multiple times on the same notification, causing consensus to receive duplicate success responses and incorrectly advance state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: send_result_to_callback()] [Response race condition] If multiple threads in state sync attempt to send responses to the same callback simultaneously, can a race condition cause undefined behavior or lost responses?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: respond_to_sync_duration_notification()] [Ledger info mismatch] Can state sync return Ok(()) but set latest_synced_ledger_info to None, causing consensus to extract None and panic on the unwrap in sync_for_duration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Error response exploitation] Can state sync deliberately return Err() responses for valid commit notifications to prevent consensus from making progress, effectively halting the chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationResponse] [Result cloning vulnerability] Does cloning Error results (via get_result) properly clone the error state, or can it lead to use-after-free or double-free issues with error strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: respond_to_sync_target_notification()] [Silent failure] If the oneshot::Sender fails to send due to receiver being dropped, is the error properly propagated, or does state sync incorrectly assume the sync succeeded? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationResponse] [Ledger info cloning overhead] Can repeatedly cloning large LedgerInfoWithSignatures objects in get_latest_synced_ledger_info cause memory exhaustion when handling many concurrent sync operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Async race condition] If multiple consensus threads call notify_new_commit concurrently, can notifications arrive at state sync in a different order than committed, causing state sync to apply transactions out-of-order and fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Clone race] Does cloning notification_sender and sending through it guarantee message ordering, or can concurrent sends from different clones cause message reordering and state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Interleaved sync attack] If consensus calls sync_for_duration and sync_to_target concurrently, can the responses get crossed, causing consensus to use the wrong ledger info for decision-making? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotificationListener] [Stream polling race] Can multiple tasks poll the ConsensusNotificationListener Stream simultaneously, causing notifications to be delivered to wrong handlers or dropped entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Timeout race with response] If state sync responds just after timeout fires but before the timeout error is returned, can consensus receive both success and timeout error, leading to inconsistent state tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: respond_to_commit_notification()] [Concurrent response handling] If state sync processes multiple commit notifications concurrently and responds out-of-order, can consensus get confused about which transactions were committed successfully? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNotifier] [Clone safety] Is the ConsensusNotifier truly thread-safe when cloned and used from multiple async tasks, or can concurrent access to internal state cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: poll_next()] [Pin safety] Can improper use of Pin::new and get_mut in the Stream implementation cause memory unsafety or data races when the listener is polled from multiple executors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Error string injection] Can an attacker manipulate error messages in NotificationError to inject misleading logs that hide the actual attack, making incident response difficult?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: sync_for_duration()] [Unwrap panic] Does the ok_or_else on latest_synced_ledger_info properly handle None cases, or can a malicious state sync return None to cause consensus to panic and crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: send_result_to_callback()] [Callback send failure] If callback.send fails due to receiver drop, does the error handling prevent cascading failures, or can it trigger additional errors that crash state sync? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/inter-component/consensus-notifications/src/lib.rs] [Function: notify_new_commit()] [Error propagation bypass] Can an attacker cause notification_sender.send to fail silently by closing the channel, making consensus think commits succeeded when they actually didn't?
