  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/util.rs] [Function: do_compile_module()] [Code Generation Error] Can specific IR patterns trigger bugs in compile_module()'s code generation that produce incorrect bytecode, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/util.rs] [Function: do_compile_script()] [Constant Folding Bug] If the compiler performs constant folding, can incorrect evaluation of compile-time constants lead to security vulnerabilities in the generated bytecode? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/util.rs] [Function: do_compile_script()] [Dependency Resolution] How are module dependencies resolved during compilation, and can attackers exploit dependency resolution to inject malicious modules or cause resolution confusion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-ir-compiler/src/util.rs] [Function: do_compile_module()] [Handle Exhaustion] If compilation creates file handles, network connections, or other system resources, can an attacker exhaust these resources through repeated compilation requests? (Medium)",
