  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/builders.rs] [Global] [Handle reference integrity] Throughout imports, various handles reference other handles by index - can circular or invalid references be created? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-binary-format/src/builders.rs] [Global] [Pool ordering dependency] Does the order of imports matter for security, or can imports in different orders produce different but semantically equivalent scripts? (Medium)",
