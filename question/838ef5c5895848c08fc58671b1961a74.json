  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Unsafe Code] Are there any unsafe blocks or FFI calls in the dependency chain (reqwest, serde_json) that could cause undefined behavior with malicious inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [HTTP Compliance] Does the code properly handle HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding, which could allow attackers to send content larger than the Content-Length header indicates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [HTTP/2 Attacks] If reqwest uses HTTP/2, can attackers exploit HTTP/2-specific vulnerabilities like request smuggling or stream manipulation to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [JSON Standard] Does the parser strictly follow RFC 8259 JSON specification, or can attackers exploit lenient parsing that accepts malformed JSON? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [URI Standards] Does the URI parsing follow RFC 3986, or can attackers exploit non-standard URI formats to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Constant Validation] At line 56, is MAX_JSON_REQUEST_RETRY_SECONDS (30s) appropriate, or could a lower value reduce attack surface while a higher value enables longer-running attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Backoff Configuration] At lines 80-83, is the MAX_RETRY_TIME_SECONDS (2s) sufficient, or can attackers exploit the short retry window to cause excessive retry attempts during network instability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Size Limit Validation] Is the max_file_size_bytes parameter at line 29 properly validated by the caller, or can an attacker pass u32::MAX to effectively disable size checking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Default Parameters] If max_file_size_bytes is 0 or negative (impossible with u32 but consider unsafe cast), does the comparison at line 41 behave correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Does the reqwest crate version used have any known CVEs related to SSRF, request smuggling, or TLS validation that could be exploited through this code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Does the serde_json crate version have any known parsing vulnerabilities or DoS vectors that could be triggered by malicious JSON input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Dependency Vulnerability] Are the image, backoff, and futures crates up-to-date with security patches, or could outdated versions expose known vulnerabilities? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Log Injection] Can attackers inject newlines or ANSI escape codes in the URI to manipulate log files or inject fake log entries? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Logic Error] Why does the function return Ok with the parsed JSON even if image and animation_url fields are missing (None) - could this cause downstream processing to fail or behave incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Validation Gap] Are there other required JSON fields beyond 'image' and 'animation_url' that should be validated but aren't, allowing incomplete or malformed NFT metadata to be stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [State Consistency] If the parse() function is called multiple times for the same URI with different max_file_size_bytes values, could this cause inconsistent state or cache poisoning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Empty Response] What happens if the server returns an empty response body (0 bytes) - does this pass validation and cause JSON parsing errors? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Array Response] What if the server returns a JSON array instead of an object - does the indexing at lines 71-73 fail safely or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/utils/json_parser.rs] [Function: parse()] [Special JSON Values] How are special JSON values (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) handled if they appear in numeric fields - could these cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
