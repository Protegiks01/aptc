  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Events with Clone/Eq/PartialEq] [Deep clone attacks] For events implementing Clone, can deeply nested or large event objects cause stack overflow or excessive memory consumption when cloned during event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Events with Eq/PartialEq] [Equality bypass] Can custom Eq implementations be exploited where two events with different semantic meaning compare as equal, enabling event deduplication bypasses or cache poisoning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Module dependency attack] If underlying event modules (coin.rs, token.rs, etc.) are updated with breaking changes, can the wildcard re-exports cause silent behavior changes that break event handling without compilation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Circular dependency] Can circular dependencies between event modules cause initialization order issues where type tags or constants are used before initialization, resulting in panics or undefined behavior? (Low)"
