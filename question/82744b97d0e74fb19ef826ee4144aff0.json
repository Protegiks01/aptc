(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Case sensitivity bypass] Is the Authorization header parsing case-sensitive, and can an attacker use 'bearer' (lowercase) or 'BEARER' instead of 'Bearer' to bypass the split_whitespace().nth(1) extraction logic?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Logic confusion] Can an attacker exploit the interaction between X_IS_JWT_HEADER check and Authorization header parsing to create a race condition where JWT validation is bypassed but auth token check also returns false, granting unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Header case manipulation] Are HTTP header names case-insensitive in the HeaderMap.contains_key() check at line 34, allowing attackers to use 'X-Is-Jwt', 'X-IS-JWT', or other variations to bypass the intended logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/bypasser/auth_token.rs] [Function: request_can_bypass()] [Dual authentication bypass] If both X_IS_JWT_HEADER and a valid bypass token are present, does the early return at line 35 prevent legitimate bypass users from accessing the faucet, creating a denial of service condition?
