  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious YAML/JSON config file with non-boolean values for skip_config_optimizer or skip_config_sanitizer that bypass serde validation, causing the deserializer to default to 'true' and disable all security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Attribute: deny_unknown_fields] [Config injection] Can an attacker inject additional unknown fields in the node_startup config section that get silently ignored due to improper serde configuration, allowing them to smuggle malicious configuration data into the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Type confusion] If serde deserialization encounters type mismatches (e.g., integer instead of boolean), does it fail safely or could it interpret non-zero integers as 'true', enabling attackers to bypass security checks by providing skip_config_sanitizer: 1? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [YAML bomb] Can an attacker craft a deeply nested or recursive YAML structure in the node_startup section that causes deserialization to consume excessive CPU/memory, leading to node startup DoS before config validation occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Struct: NodeStartupConfig] [Unicode normalization] Can an attacker use Unicode normalization attacks in YAML field names (e.g., 'skip_config_optimizer' with lookalike characters) to bypass the deny_unknown_fields check and inject malicious skip flags? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Default override] If the Default trait implementation is somehow bypassed or overridden through unsafe code elsewhere, could both security flags default to 'true' instead of 'false', causing all nodes to start with disabled security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Function: default()] [Partial deserialization] If YAML deserialization fails mid-way through parsing NodeStartupConfig, does serde properly use the default values (false) for unparsed fields, or could partially initialized structs have undefined/true values for security flags? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Attribute: serde(default)] [Missing field handling] If a node config file completely omits the 'node_startup' section, is the default() implementation guaranteed to be called with skip_config_optimizer=false and skip_config_sanitizer=false, or could uninitialized memory be used? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Mainnet seed bypass] Can a malicious mainnet node operator set skip_config_optimizer=true to prevent automatic injection of official Aptos Labs seed peers, allowing them to isolate their node and potentially perform eclipse attacks or network partitioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Validator network ID bypass] Can a malicious validator set skip_config_optimizer=true to prevent the automatic setting of validator network ID, allowing them to misconfigure their validator network connection and potentially eavesdrop on or disrupt validator consensus communications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Mutual auth bypass] Can an attacker set skip_config_optimizer=true to bypass automatic mutual authentication enablement on validator networks, allowing them to connect to validator nodes without proper authentication and potentially inject malicious consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Identity key persistence] Can setting skip_config_optimizer=true prevent the automatic loading/saving of network identity keys from disk, causing node operators to lose their network identity and potentially enabling identity theft or impersonation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_optimizer] [Listen address bypass] Can an attacker set skip_config_optimizer=true to prevent automatic listener address configuration, causing network misconfiguration that could make validator nodes unreachable during critical consensus rounds leading to liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Mainnet failpoints] Can a malicious mainnet validator set skip_config_sanitizer=true to bypass the failpoints check, enabling them to run failpoints on mainnet that could be triggered remotely to cause consensus failures, validator crashes, or double-signing violations? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Missing fullnode networks] Can an attacker set skip_config_sanitizer=true to start a public fullnode with empty fullnode network configs, causing the node to be isolated from the network and unable to sync, potentially facilitating eclipse attacks or serving stale data to users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Duplicate network IDs] Can setting skip_config_sanitizer=true allow nodes to start with duplicate network IDs in their fullnode network configs, causing network routing confusion, connection conflicts, or split-brain scenarios in the P2P layer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Wrong validator network ID] Can an attacker use skip_config_sanitizer=true to configure a validator with a non-validator network ID (e.g., NetworkId::Public), allowing them to expose validator consensus traffic on public networks or mix validator and fullnode traffic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Field: skip_config_sanitizer] [Paranoid verification bypass] Can a mainnet validator set skip_config_sanitizer=true with paranoid_hot_potato_verification=false to bypass critical Move resource verification checks, potentially enabling resource duplication or double-spending attacks through unchecked hot potato violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Total security bypass] Can a sophisticated attacker set both skip_config_optimizer=true AND skip_config_sanitizer=true to completely bypass all node startup security checks and run a maliciously configured validator on mainnet with failpoints enabled, no mutual authentication, and arbitrary network configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/node_startup_config.rs] [Both fields] [Coordinated attack] Could multiple colluding Byzantine validators (up to 1/3 of stake) coordinate to all set skip_config_optimizer=true and skip_config_sanitizer=true, creating a subset of misconfigured validators that could be exploited to break consensus safety or liveness guarantees? (Critical)",
