  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Cryptographic correctness] Does the implementation correctly compute g^dk, or is there a mathematical error in the point multiplication that could result in incorrect encryption keys being generated, breaking the DKG protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Invalid curve point] Does pp.pubkey_base() validate that it returns a point on the correct elliptic curve, or can an attacker provide malformed PublicParameters with an invalid generator point that leads to weak or predictable encryption keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Point at infinity] Can pp.pubkey_base() return the point at infinity (identity element), causing the resulting EncryptPubKey.ek to always be the identity regardless of the private key, allowing all shares to be trivially decrypted? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Subgroup attack] Does the implementation verify that pp.pubkey_base() is in the prime-order subgroup, or can an attacker provide a small-order point that results in weak encryption keys vulnerable to discrete log attacks?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Scalar validation] Does the implementation verify that self.dk is a valid scalar in the field (not zero, within range), or can invalid scalar values lead to predictable or weak encryption keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Parameter validation] Are there any checks that PublicParameters pp has been properly initialized and contains valid cryptographic parameters, or can uninitialized/corrupted parameters lead to broken key derivation?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Generator consistency] Does the implementation ensure that all validators use the same PublicParameters pp with identical pubkey_base, or can parameter inconsistencies lead to validators deriving different encryption keys from the same private key?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Timing attack] Does the mul() operation execute in constant time regardless of the scalar value self.dk, or can timing variations leak information about the private key through timing analysis during key generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Cache timing] Is the point multiplication implementation resistant to cache-timing attacks, or could an attacker on the same machine observe cache access patterns to extract bits of the private key self.dk? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Scalar overflow] Can the multiplication operation overflow or wrap around when operating on the scalar self.dk, potentially producing incorrect results or weak keys due to modular arithmetic errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Field reduction] Is the scalar self.dk properly reduced modulo the curve order before multiplication, or can out-of-range scalars lead to incorrect point computation? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/enc.rs] [Function: to()] [Scalar inversion] Should the implementation compute g^(dk^-1) instead of g^dk for correctness? Is there a mathematical error where the encryption scheme requires the inverse but only the scalar is used? (Critical)",
