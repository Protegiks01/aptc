  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: SubscriptionStreamMetadata] [Epoch mismatch] Can providing known_version_at_stream_start and known_epoch_at_stream_start that don't correspond to the same ledger state cause the server to generate proofs with inconsistent epoch information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: SubscriptionStreamMetadata] [Stream ID exhaustion] Can an attacker rapidly create and destroy subscriptions with sequential subscription_stream_id values to exhaust the ID space or cause ID collisions after wraparound?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Max response bytes bypass] Can setting max_response_bytes to u64::MAX cause integer overflow when allocating response buffers, leading to small allocations that get overwritten and cause memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Zero max bytes] Can setting max_response_bytes=0 cause division by zero errors when calculating how many transactions fit in the response, or cause the server to return empty responses even when data exists?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Version range vs byte limit conflict] Can requesting a large version range with a small max_response_bytes value cause the server to truncate data mid-transaction, returning incomplete or corrupted transaction data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Proof version boundary] Can setting proof_version to exactly an epoch transition version while requesting data from multiple epochs cause proof generation to fail or produce invalid proofs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetNewTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Known epoch race] Can concurrent requests with different known_epoch values from the same client cause the server to cache inconsistent state, leading to responses from different epochs being interleaved?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: GetNewTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Max bytes exhaustion] Can repeatedly requesting with max_response_bytes=1 force the server to return one transaction at a time, causing thousands of round trips and bandwidth amplification?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: SubscribeTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Max bytes in subscription] Can setting an extremely small max_response_bytes in a subscription cause the server to send thousands of tiny responses, overwhelming the client's processing queue and causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: SubscribeTransactionDataWithProofRequest] [Subscription index desync] Can packet loss or reordering cause subscription_stream_index values to arrive out of order, causing the server to misinterpret which data has been acknowledged and resend or skip data?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Enum: TransactionDataRequestType] [Output data vs transaction data confusion] Can a client that requests TransactionOutputData but expects to receive full transaction data fail to verify signatures or execute prologue/epilogue checks, accepting invalid transactions?

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Enum: TransactionDataRequestType] [Event inclusion in outputs] Can requesting TransactionOutputData with include_events=true in nested structs cause the server to return invalid data combinations (outputs don't have events), leading to parsing errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: TransactionData] [Event flag manipulation] Can toggling include_events rapidly across requests cause the server to cache inconsistent transaction data, potentially serving transactions without events when events should be included? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/types/src/requests.rs] [Struct: TransactionOrOutputData] [Event data inconsistency] When include_events=true but the server decides to return outputs instead of transactions due to max_num_output_reductions, does the client incorrectly expect event data that never arrives?
