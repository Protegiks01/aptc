  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Abort code collision] Can an attacker craft a custom abort code in two-argument assert! that collides with UNSPECIFIED_ABORT_CODE or other well-known abort codes, causing error handling confusion or bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Negative abort codes] If the abort_code expression evaluates to a negative number (e.g., through arithmetic overflow), could this bypass error categorization or cause unexpected behavior in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_macro()] [Error message injection] The error message at line 21 includes the attacker-controlled macro name - can special characters or escape sequences in the name cause log injection, terminal escape exploits, or downstream parsing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Multiple error conditions] If both the language version check fails AND the argument count is wrong, which error takes precedence? Can this ordering be exploited to hide critical errors behind less severe ones? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Error recovery state] When UnresolvedError is returned (lines 22, 50), does the compiler properly clean up all intermediate state, or could there be memory leaks or dangling references? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_macro()] [Error propagation] After logging an error with self.error(), does execution continue? Could this allow partially-expanded macros to proceed through compilation and cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_macro()] [Translation consistency] The expanded expression is passed to self.translate_exp() at line 5773 in exp_builder.rs - can an attacker craft macro arguments that create valid expansion AST but invalid translated expressions, causing type system bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Type inference interference] Does macro expansion happen before or after type inference? Can attacker-controlled macro arguments influence type inference in ways that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_macro()] [Module isolation] Can macros expanded in one module affect the compilation or behavior of other modules, potentially creating cross-module exploits or information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Gas metering bypass] Does the expanded IfElse properly account for gas costs? Could macro-generated code have different gas characteristics than equivalent hand-written code, enabling gas manipulation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Optimization interference] Could aggressive compiler optimizations treat macro-generated IfElse differently than user-written code, potentially removing security-critical checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Non-deterministic expansion] Is macro expansion guaranteed to be deterministic across all validator nodes? Could differences in language version, compiler flags, or environment cause different code generation leading to consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_macro()] [Location reproducibility] The Loc (location) values are used to track source positions - are these deterministic across all nodes, or could timestamp/path differences cause non-deterministic compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Code hash consistency] Does macro expansion affect the bytecode hash or module hash? Could two validators produce different hashes for the same source code due to macro expansion differences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Version divergence] If validators are running different Move compiler versions that handle assert! macro differently, could this cause consensus divergence or chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Resource in condition] Can the condition expression contain operations on Move resources (borrow, move, etc.)?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Linear type violation] If the condition involves moving a linear type (resource), does the macro expansion preserve linearity guarantees, or could resources be duplicated or dropped unsafely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Borrow scope] The IfElse creates nested scopes - do borrowed references in the condition remain valid in the unit branch, or could there be borrow checker violations in the generated code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/macros.rs] [Function: expand_assert()] [Move semantics preservation] When cloning expressions (lines 37, 44), are move semantics properly preserved? Could the clone operation violate Move's ownership rules? (High)",
