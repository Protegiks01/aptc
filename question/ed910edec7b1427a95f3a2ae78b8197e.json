(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Error Handling] Does File::open() properly handle all error cases (permission denied, file not found, too many open files, I/O errors) or do some errors propagate uncaught causing test suite failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Race Condition] Between File::open() at line 24 and read_to_string() at line 25, can the file be modified, deleted, or replaced by another process (TOCTOU vulnerability) causing inconsistent test results or data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_SENDER] [Address Validation] Is the hardcoded DEFAULT_SENDER address '0x8675309' at line 13 a valid Aptos address format, or could using it in tests cause false positives/negatives that mask real security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_SENDER] [Test Security] Can malicious tests exploit the well-known DEFAULT_SENDER address '0x8675309' to bypass access control checks or manipulate test outcomes in ways that don't reflect real-world security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_SENDER] [Address Collision] Could the DEFAULT_SENDER address '0x8675309' conflict with actual addresses on Aptos testnet/mainnet, causing confusion or test contamination? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Empty File] Does the function handle empty files correctly, or could reading an empty file cause unexpected behavior in the while loop at line 28-31? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Empty Captures] When the regex matches but the 'ann' capture group is empty (matching zero-length string), does trim() at line 29 handle this correctly or could it add empty strings to the result vector? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Whitespace Handling] Does the trim() call at line 29 properly handle all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII spaces/tabs), or could unusual whitespace in test directives cause parsing inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [No Matches] When the regex finds zero matches in the file, does the function return Ok(vec![]) as expected, or are there any edge cases that could cause errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Special Characters] Can test directives containing special characters (null bytes, control characters, UTF-8 invalid sequences) cause string corruption or security issues during extraction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Function: extract_test_directives()] [Line Length] Does the regex matching handle extremely long lines (megabytes per line) without performance degradation, or could adversarial test files with no newlines cause memory/CPU exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/test-utils/src/lib.rs] [Module: baseline_test] [Module Security] Does the baseline_test module at line 8 introduce any additional security vulnerabilities related to file operations, regex processing, or test baseline management? (Low)",
