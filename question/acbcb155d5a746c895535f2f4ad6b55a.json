  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Type args manipulation] Do StructTag definitions with empty type_args vectors properly validate that no generic type parameters should exist, or can attackers inject type_args to create polymorphic event types that bypass type safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [BCS version mismatch] Can events serialized with future BCS format versions be accepted by older validators, causing deserialization failures or silent data corruption that forks the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Partial deserialization] If try_from_bytes() encounters errors mid-deserialization, are partially-constructed event objects leaked with uninitialized fields that could be exploited for information disclosure or corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Deserialization resource exhaustion] Can malicious events with extremely large amounts (u64::MAX) or long strings exhaust memory during deserialization before validation, enabling DoS attacks against event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [NewBlockEvent export] [Event key collision] Does the new_block_event_key() function properly prevent key collisions, or can attackers emit fake NewBlockEvents with the same EventKey as legitimate blocks, causing duplicate event handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [NewEpochEvent export] [Event key manipulation] Can the event_key() function be called concurrently, creating race conditions where multiple events share keys or keys are uninitialized, leading to lost events or event replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [CoinDeposit/Withdraw exports] [Coin type injection] Can coin_type strings contain special characters, path separators, or module delimiters that exploit type parsing logic to access unauthorized coin types or system modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Collection events] [Name collision] Can collection and token name strings be crafted with Unicode homoglyphs or zero-width characters to create visually identical but distinct collections, enabling phishing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mutation events] [Field name overflow] Can mutated_field_name strings exceed expected lengths or contain binary data that overflows fixed-size buffers in event processing code, causing memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All events with AccountAddress] [Reserved address bypass] Can events use reserved system addresses (0x0, 0x1) as regular account fields to bypass permission checks that assume these addresses are only used by system code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All events with AccountAddress] [Address format confusion] Can AccountAddress fields accept both standard 32-byte addresses and special address formats, creating confusion in access control logic that checks addresses in only one format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mint export] [Snapshot staleness] Can Mint events with stale AggregatorSnapshotResource values bypass updated mint limits or quotas, allowing over-minting when the snapshot reflects outdated permissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Mint export] [Snapshot forgery] Can attackers craft fake AggregatorSnapshotResource structures with arbitrary values to mint tokens beyond collection limits, bypassing aggregator-based rate limiting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All MoveEventV2Type exports] [V1/V2 confusion] Can events implementing both old EventHandle patterns and new MoveEventV2Type be emitted in both formats simultaneously, causing double-counting or inconsistent event processing between v1 and v2 handlers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All MoveEventV2Type exports] [Event migration attack] During migration from v1 to v2 events, can attackers emit duplicate events in both formats to exploit systems that don't deduplicate, enabling double-deposit or double-withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_governance_create_proposal_event()] [Event filtering bypass] Can attackers emit CreateProposal events with slightly modified type strings that pass the check but aren't recognized as governance events, bypassing governance event monitoring and alerting systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Function: is_aptos_governance_create_proposal_event()] [Versioning confusion] Does checking for both '::CreateProposal' and '::CreateProposalEvent' create confusion where old and new event formats are treated identically, potentially enabling replay of old proposals in new governance systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [CORE_CODE_ADDRESS abuse] Can events claiming to originate from CORE_CODE_ADDRESS (0x1) be verified as actually coming from system modules, or can user code emit fake system events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [Token events] [TOKEN_ADDRESS confusion] Can the TOKEN_ADDRESS and TOKEN_OBJECTS_ADDRESS constants be confused, allowing legacy token events to be interpreted as token object events or vice versa, breaking compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All Lazy statics] [Initialization race] Can concurrent access to Lazy::new() type tags during parallel transaction execution cause race conditions where multiple threads initialize different type tag values, leading to type confusion?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All event exports] [Concurrent deserialization] When multiple transactions emit the same event types concurrently, can race conditions in try_from_bytes() implementations cause data corruption or partial event objects to leak between threads?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mod.rs] [All numeric fields] [Zero amount events] Can events with zero amounts (u64 = 0) bypass validation logic that assumes positive values, enabling ghost transactions that manipulate event counts without actual value transfer? (Low)",
