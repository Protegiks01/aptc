  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Access Control Bypass] Can an attacker access the parking lot endpoint without authentication when admin service authentication configs are empty, potentially exposing sensitive transaction data about which accounts have pending transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does the parking lot address response leak information about which accounts have pending transactions with sequence number gaps, allowing attackers to identify accounts with potential replay attack vulnerabilities or transaction ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Privacy Violation] Can an attacker use repeated queries to the parking lot endpoint to build a profile of account transaction patterns and identify high-value accounts or validator operators through transaction timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Channel Flooding] Can an attacker flood the mempool_client_sender channel with GetAddressesFromParkingLot requests using try_send, causing channel buffer exhaustion and blocking critical consensus or transaction submission requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Race Condition] If multiple concurrent requests call get_parking_lot_addresses simultaneously, can this cause race conditions in the mempool's parking lot index access, leading to inconsistent or corrupted address data being returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Channel Deadlock] Can the oneshot channel receiver.await block indefinitely if the mempool coordinator fails to respond, causing request handler threads to accumulate and eventually exhaust server resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Channel Poisoning] If mempool_client_sender.clone().try_send fails with Err(e), does the error handling at line 50-53 properly clean up the oneshot sender/receiver pair, or can this cause memory leaks through orphaned channel endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [DoS via Channel Exhaustion] Can an attacker send rapid requests to exhaust the mempool_client_sender channel capacity, causing legitimate transaction submissions or consensus messages to fail with try_send errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Memory Exhaustion] At line 19, if the parking lot contains millions of addresses, can the bcs::to_bytes(&addresses) serialization consume excessive memory and cause OOM crashes on the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Unbounded Response Size] Does bcs::to_bytes at line 19 have any size limits, or can an attacker fill the mempool parking lot with transactions to force generation of multi-gigabyte BCS responses that exhaust network bandwidth and crash clients? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Serialization DoS] If BCS serialization at line 19 is computationally expensive for large Vec<(AccountAddress, u64)> structures, can an attacker trigger repeated parking lot queries to create CPU exhaustion and slow down validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Integer Overflow] In the Vec<(AccountAddress, u64)> returned from get_parking_lot_addresses, can the u64 transaction count overflow if an account has an extremely large number of parked transactions, causing incorrect reporting or serialization failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Error Message Leakage] At lines 22-26, does e.to_string() in the error response expose internal mempool state, memory addresses, or sensitive debugging information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Silent Failure] When try_send fails at line 50, the function logs with info! and returns Err(Canceled), but does this properly propagate the failure context, or can it mask critical mempool communication failures? (Medium)",
