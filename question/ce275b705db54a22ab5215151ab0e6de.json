  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Struct: OptBlockData] [Deep Copy Cost] Does cloning OptBlockData recursively clone parent BlockInfo and entire block_body with payload, enabling DoS through expensive clone operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Validation Cost Attack] Can attackers spam OptBlockData with valid-looking but ultimately invalid blocks to force expensive verify_well_formed() calls, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Parent BlockInfo Validation] Does verify_well_formed() validate the parent BlockInfo's internal consistency (matching id to actual hash), or only its relationship to grandparent and current block? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: new()] [Parent Forgery] Can new() be called with a fabricated parent BlockInfo that has fake epoch/round/timestamp but plausible relationships to grandparent_qc? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: parent_id()] [ID Verification Gap] Since parent_id() returns self.parent.id() without verifying the ID matches parent block hash, can inconsistent parent IDs pass through? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Parent Reconfiguration State] Does the validation check if parent.has_reconfiguration() is consistent with the epoch continuity checks, or can parent have reconfiguration while epochs claim continuity? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Zero Timestamp Edge Case] Can timestamp_usecs be 0 (GENESIS_TIMESTAMP_USECS) in non-genesis blocks, and does the strictly increasing check handle this correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Maximum Values Edge Case] What happens if epoch, round, or timestamp_usecs are set to u64::MAX - do all arithmetic operations and comparisons handle maximum values correctly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty Payload Edge Case] Can new() be called with empty validator_txns vector and empty payload, creating valid but useless OptBlockData that wastes network resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Timestamp Equality Edge Case] The check on line 103 uses > for strictly increasing - is there an off-by-one error where timestamp_usecs == parent.timestamp_usecs should be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash Calculation Order] Does the CryptoHasher derive on line 21 hash fields in a deterministic order, or can field reordering create different hashes for logically identical OptBlockData? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Nested Hash Integrity] When CryptoHasher hashes the parent BlockInfo and block_body OptBlockBody, does it recursively hash their contents or just their references, allowing internal modifications to go undetected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash Collision Domain Separation] Does the CryptoHasher provide proper domain separation between OptBlockData hashes and hashes of other consensus types to prevent cross-type collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Safety Rule Integration] Does verify_well_formed() ensure OptBlockData conforms to AptosBFT safety rules (voting rules, commit rules), or only structural validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Liveness Preservation] Can verify_well_formed() reject valid blocks due to overly strict checks, causing liveness failures where honest validators cannot make progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [Deterministic Validation] Is verify_well_formed() completely deterministic across all validators, or can differences in duration_since_epoch() cause validators to disagree on block validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [QC Signature Verification] Does verify_well_formed() trigger validation of grandparent_qc signatures, or is signature verification assumed to happen elsewhere allowing forged QCs through?

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/opt_block_data.rs] [Function: verify_well_formed()] [QC Reconfiguration Check] The check on line 96 uses grandparent_qc.has_reconfiguration() - does this call BlockInfo.has_reconfiguration() or QuorumCert-specific logic, and can this be exploited?
