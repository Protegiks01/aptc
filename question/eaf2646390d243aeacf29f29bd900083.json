  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Block boundary handling] At block boundaries during sequential execution, can partial hook invocations leave the system in an inconsistent state if block execution is interrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Reference lifetime] Can hook implementations extend the lifetime of the OnceCell<TransactionOutput> reference beyond the intended scope, causing use-after-free vulnerabilities when the output is deallocated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Resource leak] If a hook implementation allocates resources during on_transaction_committed() and fails to clean them up, can repeated invocations cause memory exhaustion across thousands of transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Trait bound] [Send + Sync safety] Are the Send + Sync bounds sufficient to prevent hook implementations from capturing non-thread-safe references that could cause data races when executed concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Commit atomicity] Can hook invocation occur before the actual transaction commit to storage, allowing observers to see committed outputs before they're durably persisted, breaking atomicity guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [State divergence] If different validators use different hook implementations, can this cause state divergence where validators agree on the block but disagree on derived state, leading to network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Abort cleanup] When on_execution_aborted() is called, is the transaction guaranteed to be fully rolled back, or can partial state changes persist if the hook is invoked before rollback completes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Determinism] Can non-deterministic hook implementations cause validators to produce different side effects for the same block, breaking consensus determinism requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Panic handling] If on_transaction_committed() panics, does this crash the entire block executor or is the panic caught, and can repeated panics be used to DoS validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Panic in abort] Can a panic in on_execution_aborted() prevent proper error handling, causing the executor to lose track of aborted transactions and potentially double-execute them? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Error suppression] Are errors within hook implementations properly logged and reported, or can silent failures in hooks hide critical issues like cross-shard message delivery failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Pipeline ordering] In the execution pipeline, can hooks be invoked before gas charging or after limit checks, potentially allowing free execution of hook side effects for transactions that later fail gas checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Reconfig handling] During epoch reconfigurations, can hook invocations span epoch boundaries, causing hooks to operate with stale validator sets or configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Block limit bypass] Can hook implementations be used to bypass block gas or size limits by performing computation or storage operations outside the metered execution context? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Slow hook DoS] Can a malicious hook implementation intentionally run slowly during on_transaction_committed(), degrading block execution performance and causing validators to fall behind consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Resource exhaustion] Can hook implementations allocate unbounded memory or open file handles during invocation, causing resource exhaustion and validator crashes after processing many transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_execution_aborted] [Abort spam] Can an attacker spam transactions designed to abort, triggering excessive on_execution_aborted() calls that overwhelm the system with cleanup operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Reentrancy] Can hook implementations trigger re-entrant calls back into the block executor, causing stack overflow or infinite recursion that crashes the validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Circular dependency] Can hooks trigger operations that indirectly invoke the same hook again, creating circular dependencies that deadlock the execution engine? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Output tampering] Can malicious hook implementations modify the TransactionOutput through the OnceCell reference, corrupting the output before it's committed to storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Output validation] Are TransactionOutputs validated before being passed to hooks, or can hooks receive malformed outputs that violate protocol invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Gas manipulation] Can hooks observe TransactionOutputs before final gas charges are applied, allowing them to extract information about pre-gas-charging state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Trait bound] [Generic abuse] Can malicious code exploit the generic parameter E in NoOpTransactionCommitHook to inject unexpected types that bypass security checks in the type system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Trait: TransactionCommitHook] [Trait object safety] Is the TransactionCommitHook trait object-safe, and if not, can this limitation be exploited to create type confusion when using dynamic dispatch? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_commit_hook.rs] [Method: on_transaction_committed] [Monitoring bypass] Can malicious validators use custom hook implementations to hide transaction execution from monitoring and audit systems, masking malicious behavior? (Medium)"
