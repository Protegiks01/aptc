  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Macro: generate_error_response!] [Trait implementation order] At lines 168-274, trait implementations are generated in macro order - can this order dependency cause issues if traits are used before generation completes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Macro: generate_success_response!] [Variant explosion] At lines 321-351, each status code creates a variant with 10 fields - can large numbers of status codes cause compilation slowdown or binary bloat enabling cache timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Macro: generate_error_traits!] [Unused code elimination] At lines 80-114, multiple trait methods are marked #[allow(unused)] - can unused methods contain security bugs that aren't caught by testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: with_cursor] [StateKey conversion] At line 514, StateKey is converted via StateKeyWrapper::from(c).to_string() - can malicious state keys contain path traversal sequences or special characters that bypass access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: with_cursor] [Cursor replay] At lines 513-514, cursors are set without nonces or signatures - can attackers replay old cursors to re-access pruned state or bypass rate limits on paginated queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Cursor header] [Length validation] At line 348, cursor is a String header - can unbounded cursor strings cause HTTP header size limits to be exceeded, causing request failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [All error functions] [Timing side channel] Error construction timing varies by error type and input size - can attackers use response timing to infer information about blockchain state or existence of accounts/resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [All functions] [Integer type confusion] Multiple conversions between u8, u64, u128, and usize occur - can type mismatches at conversion boundaries cause silent truncation or sign extension bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [All response types] [OpenAPI spec divergence] Response types define OpenAPI spec via attributes - can divergence between actual implementation and spec cause client-side validation bypasses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Trait bounds] [Generic type constraints] Multiple functions have generic types with ToJSON + Send + Sync bounds - can relaxing these bounds in future changes introduce thread-safety or serialization bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: version_not_found] [Version enumeration] At lines 631-638, the function reveals requested version number in error - can attackers use binary search on version numbers to find exact pruning boundaries? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: block_pruned_by_height] [Pruning state disclosure] At lines 786-792, pruned block info is returned - can this be used to infer node storage capacity or predict when historical data will be unavailable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: account_not_found] [Account creation timing] At lines 672-686, error includes both address and ledger_version - can timing of this error reveal when accounts were created or destroyed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: resource_not_found] [Resource type oracle] At lines 688-705, StructTag canonical string is included - can this be used to enumerate all possible resource types an account might have? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: struct_field_not_found] [Schema discovery] At lines 724-743, field names are exposed in errors - can attackers reconstruct complete struct schemas by enumerating field names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: module_not_found] [Module enumeration] At lines 707-722, module names are revealed - can this enable attackers to map complete account codebases including unverified or private modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/response.rs] [Function: table_item_not_found] [Table handle exposure] At lines 745-760, table handle Address is exposed - can this reveal the internal table structure and enable attacks on table access patterns? (Low)",
