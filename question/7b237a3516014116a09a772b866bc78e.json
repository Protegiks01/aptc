  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Handler errors] Various handler functions return (StatusCode, Body, String) tuples - if a handler panics or returns an error, does this crash the entire inspection service thread or is each request properly isolated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 132-136] [Index endpoint] The INDEX_PATH endpoint lists all available endpoints - does this information aid attackers in identifying which endpoints are enabled and planning targeted information gathering campaigns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 33-41] [Endpoint constants] All endpoint paths are defined as public constants - can attackers use these hardcoded paths to automatically scan for inspection services across IP ranges, identifying validator nodes on the network? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: start_inspection_service()] [Service restart] There's no visible mechanism to restart or reload the inspection service - if the service crashes or hangs, can operators recover without restarting the entire validator, potentially causing consensus disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 75-100] [Error recovery] The spawned thread blocks on server.await.unwrap() - if the server future resolves with an error, does the thread exit cleanly or leave resources in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 172-175] [Content type] Response content-type is set based on handler return value - can attackers exploit content-type confusion if responses contain user-controlled data, potentially enabling XSS if responses are rendered in browsers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 189-197] [Error responses] Error responses use a generic UNEXPECTED_ERROR_MESSAGE - does this hide important diagnostic information that could help operators identify attacks or system issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 50-101] [Service isolation] The inspection service runs in a separate thread with its own runtime - if the inspection service is compromised or behaves maliciously, are there sufficient isolation mechanisms to prevent it from affecting validator consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: serve_requests()] [Logging] The function uses debug! for error logging - is this sufficient for security monitoring, or should authentication failures, unusual access patterns, and endpoint enumeration be logged at higher severity levels for intrusion detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 77-91] [Service factory] The make_service_fn creates new service instances for each connection - can rapid connection cycling cause memory leaks or resource exhaustion if service instances aren't properly cleaned up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Function: start_inspection_service()] [Network exposure timing] The service starts immediately with no delay or coordination with other validator components - can attackers exploit the window between service start and full validator initialization to gather information about a partially-initialized validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 50-101] [Cross-service attacks] If an attacker gains access to the inspection service endpoints, can they use timing analysis of response times across multiple endpoints to infer validator state, transaction processing patterns, or consensus voting behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 147-155] [Network mapping] By repeatedly querying peer_information across multiple validators, can an attacker construct a complete map of the Aptos network topology, identifying critical validators, network partitions, or trust relationships? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 127-130] [Identity correlation] Can attackers correlate identity_information across multiple inspection service queries to track validator identity changes, migrations, or operator changes, potentially deanonymizing validator operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 117-121] [Consensus monitoring] Can attackers continuously poll consensus_health_check across the validator set to detect consensus failures early, potentially coordinating Byzantine attacks to exploit the window before operators respond? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 142-146] [Metrics correlation] Can attackers correlate metrics from multiple validators to infer which validators are processing which transactions, potentially enabling MEV attacks or front-running in the presence of parallel execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 78-91] [Arc cloning] The move closures capture cloned Arc-wrapped data structures - are there any interior mutability patterns (RefCell, Mutex) that could cause runtime panics or deadlocks when accessed concurrently from multiple requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 104-198] [Async lifetime] The serve_requests function is async and clones inputs - can long-lived references in async contexts cause memory leaks if requests are cancelled or time out? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 77-91] [Move semantics] Multiple move closures capture cloned data - if cloning is expensive or involves deep copies, can this cause performance degradation under high request load, impacting validator responsiveness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 112-116] [Config-based access] The expose_configuration flag controls access to the configuration endpoint - can an attacker who compromises the node configuration toggle these flags to enable information disclosure on otherwise-protected mainnet validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 127-130] [Identity exposure control] The expose_identity_information flag protects identity data - but if default values enable this endpoint, can misconfigured mainnet validators accidentally expose their identities, enabling targeted attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 147-155] [Peer exposure control] The expose_peer_information flag controls peer data - is this flag properly initialized for all validator types, or can default configurations lead to unintended peer information disclosure on production networks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 156-160] [System exposure control] The expose_system_information flag protects system data - can attackers exploit timing differences between when the flag is checked and when data is returned to access information that should be protected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 60-69] [Address parsing] The to_socket_addrs() call uses .next().unwrap() to get the first address - if DNS returns multiple addresses, can the wrong address be selected, potentially binding to an unintended network interface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/mod.rs] [Lines: 72-73] [Runtime naming] The runtime is created with a specific name 'inspection' - can conflicts with other named runtimes cause initialization failures or unexpected behavior? (Low)"
