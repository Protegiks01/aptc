  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Epoch Overflow] Can epoch value exceed the maximum epoch reached by the network, causing validators to accept future state snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Version-Epoch Mismatch] If version number is from epoch N but epoch field says epoch M (N != M), can this cause validator set verification to use the wrong epoch's validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [BCS Bomb] Can the blobs file contain a BCS-serialized record that claims enormous length, causing the deserializer to allocate gigabytes before realizing it's invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [BCS Version Mismatch] If proof FileHandle contains BCS data serialized with a different BCS version, can deserialization succeed but produce incorrect/corrupted data structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Malformed Records] Can the 'len(record) + record' format in blobs be exploited with mismatched lengths (claimed length > actual length) to read past buffer boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Manifest Substitution] Can an attacker replace a legitimate manifest JSON file with a malicious one mid-restoration without detection due to missing HMAC/signature on the manifest itself? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Chunk Replacement] If chunks are downloaded concurrently, can an attacker perform race condition attacks to replace chunk data between download and verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Resume Attack] If restoration resumes from previous_key_hash, can manipulated manifests skip verification of chunks before the resume point, restoring unverified state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Empty Blob File] Can a chunk with valid indices and proof but empty blobs FileHandle be accepted, creating 'ghost accounts' in the index range that don't exist in state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Single Chunk Edge Case] If chunks Vec contains only one chunk covering the entire state, are there special validation bypasses that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Maximum Size Chunk] Can a single chunk claim to contain the entire blockchain state (billions of accounts), causing memory exhaustion when loaded into a Vec? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Proof Without Chunks] Can a StateSnapshotBackup with valid proof but empty/missing chunks be used to 'certify' that the state is empty, wiping all account data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [JSON Injection] When serializing StateSnapshotBackup to JSON, can unescaped characters in FileHandle paths break JSON structure, causing parsing errors or injection attacks on consumers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Determinism] Are serialized manifests deterministic (same struct → same JSON), or can different serializations of the same data cause hash mismatches in verification? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Zero Hash] Can first_key or last_key be set to the zero hash (all zeros), potentially matching the SPARSE_MERKLE_PLACEHOLDER_HASH and causing confusion with empty tree nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Root Hash Zero] Can root_hash be set to zero/placeholder hash to match an empty tree, allowing attackers to certify empty state snapshots as valid? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Hash Ordering] Does chunk ordering rely on HashValue lexicographic ordering, and can attackers exploit hash ordering properties to place malicious chunks at specific tree positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Module Validation Bypass] If validate_modules flag is set but manifest chunks contain non-module state data with Code paths, can validation be bypassed for actual malicious modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Proof-less Restoration] In StateSnapshotRestoreMode::fast_restore mode, are proof verifications skipped, allowing completely unverified manifests to be restored? (Critical)",
