  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [Memory disclosure] After Config is dropped, does the api_key String get properly zeroed in memory, or can sensitive key material be recovered from heap dumps or core dumps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [Serialization exposure] When Config is serialized with serde_json::to_string_pretty(), is the api_key included in the JSON output, potentially exposing it through error messages or API responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [Backup exposure] If config files are included in system backups or snapshots, can attackers with backup access extract api_key values and compromise remote node authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [API key validation] Does the code validate api_key format or length, or can attackers inject excessively long or malformed keys that cause buffer overflows or DoS in downstream HTTP clients?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [Version downgrade attack] Can an attacker modify a saved config file to set network_version to an older value, causing the simulation session to use outdated protocol rules and potentially bypass security fixes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [Version mismatch] Does the code validate that network_version matches the current network protocol version, or can mismatched versions cause state inconsistencies or consensus failures during simulation?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: Config] [Operations counter rollback] Can an attacker modify a saved config to set ops to 0 after many operations have been performed, causing session state to be incorrectly restored and enabling replay of old transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: Config] [Operations counter manipulation] Can an attacker artificially inflate the ops counter in a saved config to skip validation checks or bypass rate limiting that depends on operation counts?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [JSON injection] Can special characters in node_url or api_key break JSON serialization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JSON fields or create malformed configs that bypass validation on reload?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [Serialization consistency] If serde_json::to_string_pretty() produces different output for semantically equivalent Config objects due to field ordering, can this cause unnecessary file rewrites or version conflicts?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: Config] [Missing integrity check] Does the saved config file include any checksums or signatures to detect tampering, or can an attacker arbitrarily modify saved configs without detection? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Enum: BaseState] [Discriminant manipulation] Can an attacker craft a binary file (if used instead of JSON) with invalid enum discriminants for BaseState that bypass Rust's type safety and cause memory corruption?
