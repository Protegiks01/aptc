  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic vulnerability] Can malicious modification of the hardcoded hex literal '0x1' in AccountAddress::from_hex_literal() cause a panic via unwrap(), leading to DoS of the Move CLI tool preventing developers from building or testing Move code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Supply chain attack] If an attacker compromises the build process and modifies line 11 to use an invalid hex address format, will the unwrap() panic expose the CLI to denial of service, preventing legitimate Move package compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege escalation] Does the hardcoded address '0x1' at line 11 grant special privileges to native functions, and could modification of this address allow unauthorized native function registration under privileged system accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error handling bypass] Since unwrap() is used on line 11 without proper error handling, can an attacker exploit this to prevent error logging or crash reporting, hiding evidence of tampering attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Address validation] Is there any validation that the address '0x1' is actually a valid system address for native function registration, or could substitution with arbitrary addresses bypass security boundaries between user and system code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Gas bypass] By setting GasParameters::zeros() on line 12, does this completely disable gas metering for native functions, allowing unbounded computation that could enable DoS attacks through infinite loops in Move code during CLI testing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource exhaustion] Can the use of GasParameters::zeros() and NurseryGasParameters::zeros() on lines 12-14 enable attackers to craft malicious Move packages that consume unlimited CPU/memory resources during move-cli test execution, crashing developer machines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Economic model bypass] Does zeros() gas configuration allow developers to test Move code with unrealistic gas assumptions, potentially deploying contracts to production that immediately fail due to gas limits, causing fund loss scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Native function abuse] With zero gas costs for all_natives() and nursery_natives() on lines 12-14, can malicious Move code exploit expensive native operations (cryptography, hashing, vector operations) without limits during CLI execution to perform cryptomining or other abuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Testing bypass] Does the zero gas configuration create a discrepancy between CLI test behavior and production execution, where code passes CLI tests but fails in production, potentially hiding bugs that could cause loss of funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Native injection] Can the chaining of all_natives() and nursery_natives() on lines 12-15 be exploited if an attacker modifies the move-stdlib dependency to inject malicious native functions that execute arbitrary code when invoked from Move packages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Duplicate natives] Is there validation to prevent duplicate native function registration when chaining all_natives() with nursery_natives(), which could cause undefined behavior or allow nursery natives to shadow production natives with malicious implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Nursery stability] Since nursery_natives() includes experimental functions on line 14, can unstable or unaudited nursery natives be exploited during CLI usage to trigger undefined behavior, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Native versioning] Does the collect() operation on line 15 ensure proper ordering and versioning of native functions, or could race conditions in native registration cause non-deterministic behavior where different CLI invocations register natives differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Trust boundary] Are all_natives() and nursery_natives() on lines 12-14 properly sandboxed, or can they access host system resources (filesystem, network) in ways that malicious Move code could exploit to exfiltrate data or perform unauthorized operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Cost table manipulation] Can the INITIAL_COST_SCHEDULE reference on line 10 be manipulated through environment variables or configuration files to alter gas costs, enabling attackers to test Move code with incorrect cost models that hide DoS vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Determinism violation] Is the cost_table from move_vm_test_utils::gas_schedule guaranteed to be deterministic across different platforms and architectures, or could platform-specific differences cause Move code to behave differently in CLI tests versus production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Cost table staleness] Does line 10's INITIAL_COST_SCHEDULE reflect current production gas costs, or is this a legacy test schedule that could mislead developers about actual gas consumption, causing deployed contracts to run out of gas unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Memory exhaustion] Can the cost_table passed on line 17 enable memory-intensive operations without proper limits during CLI test execution, allowing malicious Move packages to consume excessive memory and crash the CLI process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Genesis state bypass] By passing ChangeSet::new() (empty changeset) on line 17, does this create an unrealistic testing environment where Move code cannot properly test state initialization, potentially hiding bugs in genesis or state migration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [State inconsistency] Can the empty ChangeSet on line 17 cause Move CLI tests to pass for code that depends on specific genesis state, only to fail in production when deployed to networks with different initial state, causing loss of funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource initialization] Does ChangeSet::new() prevent proper testing of Move resource initialization logic, allowing developers to deploy contracts that fail to initialize critical resources, permanently locking funds or bricking accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Account existence] With an empty genesis changeset on line 17, can Move code that assumes certain accounts exist (like 0x1 framework account) fail unexpectedly during CLI testing, masking critical deployment issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error propagation] Does the Result<()> return type on line 9 properly propagate errors from move_cli() on line 17, or can error swallowing hide critical failures like native function registration errors or VM initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic boundary] Since main() returns Result<()> but uses unwrap() on line 11, is there proper panic handling to prevent uncaught panics from leaving the CLI in an inconsistent state or corrupting user data? (Medium)"
