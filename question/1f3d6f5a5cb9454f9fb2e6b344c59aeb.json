  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Concurrency] [Status propagation delay] Can delays in status propagation between mempool worker threads and consensus threads cause transactions to be committed despite having rejection status codes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Fuzzing] [Arbitrary trait exploitation] Since the code uses #[cfg(any(test, feature = 'fuzzing'))] with Arbitrary trait, can the fuzzing configuration be enabled in production builds, exposing validators to arbitrary status generation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Fuzzing] [Proptest edge cases] Does the proptest configuration properly exercise all status code combinations, or are there edge cases (e.g., status codes with empty vs. very long messages) that remain untested and exploitable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Edge case] [Empty message handling] When message is empty string, can downstream code that expects non-empty messages for error logging or metrics crash or exhibit undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Edge case] [Maximum u64 status] Can u64::MAX be passed to try_from(), and does the error handling gracefully prevent this from causing integer overflow in arithmetic operations on status codes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Type safety] [Enum exhaustiveness] If new status codes are added without updating all match statements, can non-exhaustive patterns cause unreachable code paths to be executed, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Memory safety] [String allocation DoS] Can repeated allocations of large status message strings fragment the heap and degrade allocator performance, enabling timing-based DoS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Memory safety] [Use-after-free] If MempoolStatus is stored in an Arc and multiple threads access message concurrently, can race conditions in String deallocation cause use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [API] [Status code exposure] Do public APIs return raw status codes that expose internal mempool state, allowing attackers to infer mempool capacity and transaction volumes for network analysis attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [API] [Error message sanitization] Are error messages in MempoolStatus sanitized before being returned in API responses, or can they leak sensitive information like account addresses or transaction details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [API] [Status polling attack] Can attackers repeatedly poll transaction status to infer mempool state transitions, enabling precise timing attacks for frontrunning or transaction censorship? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Governance] [Status code extension] If governance proposes adding new status codes beyond RejectedByFilter(7), can old validators that don't recognize new codes enter undefined states causing chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Upgrade] [Backward compatibility] Are status code changes backward compatible across network upgrades, or can mixed validator versions interpret the same u64 status value differently, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Upgrade] [Status migration] During protocol upgrades that modify status semantics, is there proper migration logic to convert old status codes to new ones without causing transaction processing failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Validation] [Status code range] Is there validation that status code u64 values fall within the expected range [0,7], or can out-of-range values propagate through the system causing arithmetic overflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Validation] [Message length bounds] Are there enforced bounds on message string length in constructors and setters to prevent unbounded memory consumption in mempool status storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Validation] [Status transition rules] Can invalid status transitions (e.g., Accepted → InvalidSeqNumber) occur without validation, causing inconsistent transaction lifecycle management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Cryptographic] [Status tampering] If status codes are included in signed messages or cryptographic commitments, can attackers forge status updates to manipulate transaction processing without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Cryptographic] [Status determinism] Are status code assignments deterministic for the same transaction across all validators, or can non-deterministic status assignment cause consensus disagreements? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Monitoring] [Status metrics manipulation] Can attackers craft transactions that trigger specific status codes to manipulate mempool metrics and dashboard displays, hiding ongoing attacks from monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Monitoring] [Rate limiting bypass] Can repeated status code checks (e.g., checking if status is Accepted) be used to bypass rate limiting on transaction submission by making it appear that rejections are happening normally? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Economic] [Status-based fee manipulation] Can attackers exploit the InvalidUpdate(4) status code that only allows gas price increases to manipulate transaction ordering and extract MEV through strategic gas price updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Economic] [Mempool griefing] Can attackers intentionally trigger MempoolIsFull(2) status to prevent legitimate high-value transactions from entering mempool, causing economic harm to users? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/mempool_status.rs] [Configuration] [Status code constants] Are status code u64 values (0-7) hardcoded consistently across the codebase, or can configuration mismatches cause validators to interpret status codes differently? (High)"
