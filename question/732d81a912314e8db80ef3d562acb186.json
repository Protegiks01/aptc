  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_stack_size()] [Integer Overflow] Can passing usize::MAX or extremely large stack sizes cause integer overflow in the underlying thread creation, leading to test crashes or undefined behavior? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_stack_size()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can calling with_stack_size() with arbitrarily large stack sizes (e.g., gigabytes) cause memory exhaustion and crash the test suite, creating a denial-of-service for CI/CD pipelines? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_stack_size()] [Error Handling] Does the error conversion logic properly preserve error information when thread spawn fails, or could critical spawn failure details be lost in the Box<dyn Any> conversion? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_stack_size()] [Thread Safety] Can race conditions occur if multiple tests concurrently call with_stack_size() with overlapping stack memory regions, potentially causing memory corruption in test execution? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Integer Overflow] In the range calculation (max - to_select)..max, can underflow occur if to_select > max due to the .min(max) operation being applied incorrectly, causing panic or incorrect sampling? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Off-by-One Error] Does the +1 adjustment in indexes[iter_idx].as_ref().index(choice + 1) correctly handle the boundary case when choice is 0, or could it cause incorrect index selection at boundaries? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Algorithm Correctness] Can the Floyd F2 algorithm implementation fail to maintain uniform distribution when indexes_len equals max, potentially biasing test case generation? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Collection Insertion] Can the BTreeSet.insert() operation fail silently or behave unexpectedly when idx and choice collide, leading to fewer selected items than expected? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Boundary Condition] When max is 0, does the function correctly return an empty vector, or could edge case handling cause panic or infinite loops? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_idxs()] [Index Access] Can out-of-bounds access occur when accessing indexes[iter_idx] if iter_idx exceeds the actual length of the indexes collection? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_slice_idxs()] [Empty Slice] Does the function handle empty slices correctly, or could calling it with &[] cause unexpected behavior in the underlying pick_idxs() function? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Function: pick_slice_idxs()] [Length Mismatch] Can inconsistencies between the slice length and the actual indexes cause incorrect sampling or panics in proptest scenarios? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Index] [Arbitrary Derivation] Can the proptest_derive::Arbitrary implementation for Index generate invalid PropIndex values that cause downstream test failures? (Test Infrastructure Issue)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-proptest-helpers/src/lib.rs] [Struct: Index] [Deref Pattern] Does the Deref implementation correctly maintain invariants, or could dereferencing lead to unexpected lifetime issues in complex test scenarios? (Test Infrastructure Issue)"
