  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 3-6: Type Re-exports] [Cryptographic Library Dependency] Are the re-exported types from ark_bls12_381 library (G1Affine, G1Projective, G2Affine, G2Projective, Fr, Fq) sourced from a verified and audited version of the arkworks library, or could a supply chain attack inject malicious elliptic curve implementations that break pairing security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 3-6: BLS12-381 Selection] [Curve Security Properties] Does the BLS12-381 curve choice provide sufficient security margin (128-bit security level) against quantum attacks using Shor's algorithm, or should the system prepare migration to post-quantum cryptography? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 8-11: Type Aliases] [Type Confusion] Can type aliasing of G1Prepared, G2Prepared, and PairingOutput lead to confusion where developers incorrectly use unprepared group elements in pairing operations, bypassing security checks or causing computation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 4: PairingSetting] [Pairing Configuration] Does the ark_bls12_381::Bls12_381 pairing configuration use constant-time implementations resistant to timing side-channel attacks, or could an attacker extract secret key material through timing analysis of pairing operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 13-22: Commented BN254] [Configuration Switching] If the commented BN254 configuration is ever uncommented and deployed, could this silently break cryptographic invariants in systems expecting BLS12-381's 128-bit security level, as BN254 provides only ~100-bit security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 14-17: BN254 Alternative] [Curve Choice Inconsistency] Does documentation clearly warn that switching to BN254 (commented lines) reduces security from 128-bit to ~100-bit level, potentially making the system vulnerable to well-resourced adversaries who can break BN254? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 5: Fr Field] [Scalar Field Arithmetic] Do cryptographic operations using the Fr (scalar field) type ensure proper modular reduction to prevent scalar overflow attacks where malformed scalars could leak key material or break discrete log security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 5: Fq Field] [Base Field Operations] Are operations on Fq (base field) resistant to invalid curve point attacks where adversaries supply points not on the curve, potentially bypassing signature verification or encryption security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 8-9: Prepared Types] [Pairing Optimization] Do the G1Prepared and G2Prepared types enforce that group elements are properly validated before preparation for pairing, or could an attacker supply malicious points that crash nodes or leak information during pairing computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 10: PairingOutput] [Pairing Result Validation] Does the PairingOutput type from ark_ec guarantee that pairing results are in the correct subgroup (GT), or could subgroup attacks bypass signature verification by producing valid-looking but cryptographically invalid outputs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Global Type Definitions] [Compilation Safety] If multiple versions of this file exist with different curve configurations (BLS12-381 vs BN254), could linking confusion cause nodes to use incompatible cryptographic primitives, leading to consensus failures or state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 3: ark_bls12_381 Dependency] [Library Vulnerability] Has the specific version of ark_bls12_381 used been audited for known vulnerabilities like the arkworks invalid point validation issues (CVE-style bugs), which could allow attackers to forge signatures or break encryption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Lines 3-6: Public Re-exports] [API Surface] By publicly re-exporting low-level elliptic curve types (G1Projective, G2Projective), does this expose dangerous operations to higher-level code that might misuse projective coordinates, leading to point-at-infinity attacks or identity element exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Line 11: Pairing Type] [Bilinear Map Security] Does the ark_bls12_381::Bls12_381 pairing implementation resist small subgroup attacks where adversaries craft elements in small-order subgroups to break DDH assumptions used in batch encryption protocols? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-batch-encryption/src/group.rs] [Configuration File Design] [Single Point of Failure] As this file centrally defines all cryptographic primitives for batch encryption, could a single compromised commit changing the curve (e.g., to a backdoored implementation) break the entire distributed key generation and encryption system without immediate detection? (Critical)"
