  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/lib.rs] [Function: run()] [Configuration bypass] Can an attacker provide a malicious config file path that exploits path traversal to load arbitrary configuration files, potentially compromising validator keys or consensus parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/lib.rs] [Function: run()] [Authentication bypass] In test mode, does the node properly validate that test configurations are never used in production, or can an attacker launch a production node with test security parameters bypassing authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_and_report_ports()] [Panic handler manipulation] Can an attacker trigger conditions that bypass the panic handler setup, allowing the node to crash without proper crash reporting and potentially losing critical safety data? (High)",
