  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/hex_string.rs] [Function: decode()] [Boundary conditions] At the boundary between valid and invalid hex (e.g., 'G'), is the error index correctly reported? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/hex_string.rs] [Function: decode()] [Thread safety] Is decode() thread-safe for concurrent compilation of multiple Move modules, or could shared state in the hex crate cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/hex_string.rs] [Function: decode()] [Diagnostic race] Can concurrent decode() calls race when adding diagnostics to the compilation environment, causing error message corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/hex_string.rs] [Function: decode()] [Panic propagation] If one thread panics in decode(), does it properly clean up or could it corrupt shared compilation state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/expansion/hex_string.rs] [Function: decode()] [Version compatibility] If the hex crate is upgraded to a new major version, could behavior changes in decode() break existing Move contracts? (High)",
