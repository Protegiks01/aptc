(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/counters.rs] [Metric: BLOCK_EXECUTOR_EXECUTE_BLOCK_SECONDS] [Panic] Does the unwrap() call on line 24 create a panic vulnerability during metric registration that could crash a validator node at startup, causing loss of liveness if multiple validators fail simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/counters.rs] [Metric: BLOCK_EXECUTOR_EXECUTE_BLOCK_SECONDS] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the system with blocks that execute at edge-case durations (e.g., exactly on bucket boundaries at 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 seconds) to exhaust memory in the histogram data structures and degrade validator performance?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/counters.rs] [Metric: BLOCK_EXECUTOR_CONCURRENCY] [Panic] Does the unwrap() call on line 32 during gauge registration create a startup panic risk that could prevent validator nodes from initializing and cause network-wide liveness issues if propagated across validators?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/counters.rs] [Metric: BLOCK_EXECUTOR_CONCURRENCY] [State Inconsistency] If BLOCK_EXECUTOR_CONCURRENCY is decremented incorrectly due to exceptions or panics in parallel execution threads, can this lead to permanent gauge value drift that obscures actual parallelism levels and prevents detection of Block-STM failures?
