  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: process_file()] [Input Validation] Can a maliciously crafted Z3 log file with extremely large size cause unbounded memory allocation in BufReader, leading to developer machine resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: process_file()] [Error Handling] Does the error handling at line 23-24 properly prevent continuation with corrupted model state after parsing errors, or could partial parsing lead to misleading verification results? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: process_file()] [Path Traversal] Can the 'path' parameter be exploited with directory traversal sequences (../) to read arbitrary files on the developer's system? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: id2s()] [Panic/Unwrap] Does the unwrap() at line 36 cause panic if the ID is invalid, potentially crashing the analysis tool without useful error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: compute_instantiation_times()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can extremely large instantiation_timestamps vectors at line 44-48 cause excessive memory allocation or slow performance on developer machines? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: compute_instantiation_times()] [Logic Error] Does the pattern matching at lines 51-52 correctly handle all Term variants, or could unmatched variants result in incorrect '??' labels misleading verification analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: plot_instantiations()] [Panic/Unwrap] Can empty 'times' input at line 70 with unwrap_or(0) followed by array access at line 70 cause inconsistent behavior or panics? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/z3log.rs] [Function: plot_instantiations()] [Resource Limits] Can top_n parameter at line 87 be arbitrarily large, causing excessive rendering time or memory usage in chart generation? (Low)",
