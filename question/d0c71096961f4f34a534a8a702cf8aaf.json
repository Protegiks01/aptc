  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Requester authorization] Is there verification that the sender of DKGTranscriptRequest is an authorized validator for the specified dealer_epoch, or can anyone on the network send requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage::TranscriptResponse] [Response authorization] Does the system verify that TranscriptResponse originates from a validator authorized to participate in DKG for the target epoch, preventing unauthorized transcript injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch-based access control] Is epoch() used for access control decisions, and if so, can epoch manipulation bypass authorization checks by making unauthorized messages appear to be from valid epochs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Invalid state transitions] Can receiving TranscriptResponse before sending TranscriptRequest cause the DKG state machine to enter invalid states or bypass required validation steps? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Struct: DKGTranscriptRequest] [Duplicate request handling] If the same DKGTranscriptRequest is received multiple times, can this cause validators to generate and send multiple TranscriptResponse messages, amplifying network traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/types.rs] [Enum: DKGMessage] [Response without request] Can validators receive and process TranscriptResponse messages without having sent corresponding TranscriptRequest, potentially accepting unsolicited transcripts? (High)"
