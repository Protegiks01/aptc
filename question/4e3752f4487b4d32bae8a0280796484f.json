  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: Batch::new() with expiration] [Expiration overflow] If expiration timestamp calculations overflow (e.g., current_time + duration > u64::MAX), can batches become permanently valid or instantly expired? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchRequest::verify()] [Sender spoofing] Does verify() only check peer_id == source, or can an attacker manipulate network-level peer_id to impersonate another validator when requesting batches? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchRequest::verify()] [Weak validation] The verify function only checks source equality - can an attacker send batch requests for digests they don't own, causing validators to leak batch data to unauthorized peers? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchRequest::new()] [Epoch mismatch] Can an attacker create batch requests with incorrect epoch values to query batches from different epochs, causing cross-epoch data leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchRequest::digest()] [Digest forgery] Can an attacker compute valid digests for batches they haven't created, using those digests to request and obtain batch data from other validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Enum: BatchResponse] [Type confusion] Can an attacker respond with BatchResponse::NotFound containing a forged LedgerInfoWithSignatures to trick requesters into believing a batch doesn't exist when it actually does? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Enum: BatchResponse] [Version mismatch] Can sending BatchResponse::Batch (V1) when BatchResponse::BatchV2 is expected cause deserialization errors or type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Enum: BatchResponse::NotFound] [Signature forgery] Does NotFound variant properly validate the LedgerInfoWithSignatures, or can an attacker forge signatures to create fake proofs of batch non-existence? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::verify()] [Empty message bypass] The check 'ensure!(!self.batches.is_empty())' rejects empty messages, but can an attacker send a message with zero-length batches vector to bypass subsequent validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::verify()] [Batch count overflow] Can an attacker send more than max_num_batches by exploiting integer overflow in the length check, overwhelming validator processing capacity? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::verify()] [Author validation bypass] The check 'epoch_authors.contains_key(&batch.author())' validates batch authors, but can an attacker exploit race conditions during validator set updates to include unauthorized authors? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::verify()] [Peer mismatch exploit] Does the check 'batch.author() == peer_id' prevent all author spoofing attacks, or can an attacker use network-layer peer_id manipulation to send batches on behalf of other validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::epoch()] [Epoch inconsistency] If batches have mismatched epochs but the check only validates they're all equal, can an attacker send batches from a wrong epoch that all share the same incorrect epoch value? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::epoch()] [Empty check bypass] The function checks '!self.batches.is_empty()' but returns the first batch's epoch - can this be exploited if batches vector is concurrently modified? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::author()] [None handling] If author() returns None when batches is empty, can calling code improperly handle the None case, leading to authorization bypass or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Function: BatchMsg::take()] [Double consumption] Can take() be called multiple times on the same BatchMsg, or can cloned BatchMsg instances allow multiple consumptions of the same batches? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize for PersistedValue] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft malicious serialized PersistedValue data that deserializes into inconsistent state (e.g., None payload but info claims data exists)? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/types.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize for Batch] [Serde injection] Does the custom Deserialize implementation using DeserializeNameAdapter properly validate type names, or can attackers inject arbitrary type names to bypass security checks? (Critical)",
