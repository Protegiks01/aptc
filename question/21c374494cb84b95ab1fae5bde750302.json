  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Generic: C] [Curve type confusion] The low_degree_test_group is generic over C: CurveGroup. Can an attacker use a curve with different security properties (e.g., weak discrete log) to break the test? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Trait: FftField] [FFT field requirements] Lines 11 imports FftField. Can a field that does not have a large enough multiplicative subgroup cause FFT operations to fail or produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [Randomness quality] Line 81 samples n - t random field elements. If the randomness is biased or has low entropy, can the SCRAPE protocol's security guarantees be weakened? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test_group()] [Discrete log assumption] The MSM operation at line 150 relies on the hardness of discrete log. Can quantum computers or specialized hardware break this assumption, allowing attackers to forge passing tests? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Protocol: SCRAPE] [Polynomial interpolation] The protocol assumes that n evaluations uniquely determine a degree n-1 polynomial. Can an attacker exploit field characteristic properties or evaluation point choices to create ambiguity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Usage: DKG] [Dealer dishonesty] In DKG protocols using this LowDegreeTest, can a malicious dealer choose polynomial evaluations that pass the test but encode a polynomial of different degree, breaking threshold security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Usage: DKG] [Verifier collusion] If multiple verifiers share the same dual code word polynomial f (e.g., due to deterministic RNG), can they collude to accept invalid polynomial shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Usage: DKG] [Reconstruction failure] If the low-degree test incorrectly rejects valid polynomial evaluations (false negative), can this prevent DKG from completing, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Threshold manipulation] Can an attacker choose t and n such that t is very close to n, making the test trivial (line 104-106) and allowing high-degree polynomials to pass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Domain size attack] Can an attacker provide a batch_dom with size much larger than necessary, causing excessive computation in FFT operations and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Evaluation point choice] When includes_zero is true, the evaluation at zero has special treatment. Can an attacker manipulate which evaluation corresponds to zero to confuse the validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Field element sum] Line 122-126 sums field elements. Can accumulated rounding errors in non-prime fields cause the sum to be near-zero but not exactly zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Multiplication accuracy] Line 203 computes v.mul(f). Can the multiplication operation overflow the field modulus, causing incorrect results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test_group()] [Scalar multiplication] The MSM at line 150 performs scalar multiplications. Can scalar values close to the group order cause wraparound issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Minimum threshold] What happens when t = 1? Does the code handle this edge case correctly, or can it lead to degenerate dual code words? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Maximum threshold] When t = n - 1, the polynomial f has length 1 (just the constant term). Can this cause issues in FFT operations or Lagrange denominator computations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Empty evaluations] Although line 98-100 checks for empty evals, can a length-zero evaluation array bypass the check due to integer overflow in self.n? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Single evaluation] When n = 1, does the code correctly handle the case of a single evaluation, or can it cause division by zero in Lagrange denominators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Timing attack] Does the execution time of the inner product computation at lines 122-126 depend on the values of the evaluations, potentially leaking information about the polynomial? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test_group()] [MSM timing] Can timing variations in the MSM operation at line 150 reveal information about the scalar values, compromising the secrecy of the dual code word? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [FFT cache timing] If FFT uses cached twiddle factors, can cache timing attacks reveal information about the polynomial coefficients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Documentation] [Comment accuracy] Line 16-20 describes the protocol. Are the comments accurate, or can misleading documentation cause incorrect usage that leads to security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Variable naming] Line 203 uses variables v and f, but line 197 comment suggests v_i and f(\\omega^i). Can this naming confusion lead to incorrect implementation in future modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Magic numbers] Lines 104-106 have special case for t == n. Is this magic number well-documented, or can future changes break this assumption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Functions: new() and dual_code_word()] [State consistency] The constructor validates parameters, but can dual_code_word() be called on an inconsistent LowDegreeTest instance created through unsafe code? (Medium)"
