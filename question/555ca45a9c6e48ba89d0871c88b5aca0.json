  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Special Files] Can input_path or output_path refer to special files (devices, named pipes, sockets) that cause unexpected behavior when read/written? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode Handling] Are file paths with Unicode characters, null bytes, or invalid UTF-8 sequences properly sanitized before passing to Path::new()? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent Access] If multiple tool instances access same input/output files concurrently, can file locking issues cause corruption or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Signal Handling] If tool receives SIGINT/SIGTERM during file writes, are output files left in consistent state or corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Module: coverage_map] [Supply Chain] Are the imported CoverageMap and TraceMap types from move_coverage crate properly audited for vulnerabilities in their parsing/serialization logic? (Low)",

  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Empty Files] How does the tool handle empty input trace files or empty --update files - does it create valid empty coverage maps or error out? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/tools/move-coverage/src/bin/move-trace-conversion.rs] [Function: main()] [Same Input/Output] If args.input_file_path equals args.output_file_path, can this cause file corruption or data loss during read-write cycle? (Low)",
