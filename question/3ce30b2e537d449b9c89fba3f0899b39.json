  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Serialization] [Size limits] Are there limits on SafetyRulesInput message sizes, or can an attacker send arbitrarily large messages causing memory exhaustion in the safety rules process? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Serialization] [Type confusion] Can an attacker send SafetyRulesInput with mismatched types (e.g., constructing a Vote request but with OrderVote data) causing type confusion and incorrect safety decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Concurrency] [Data race in ProcessData] ProcessData is not marked Send+Sync explicitly - can moving it to a different thread cause undefined behavior if PersistentSafetyStorage has non-thread-safe internal state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Concurrency] [Storage concurrent access] If multiple ProcessService clients connect simultaneously to remote_service::execute(), does PersistentSafetyStorage handle concurrent reads/writes to SafetyData atomically? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Concurrency] [Cached safety data race] When enable_cached_safety_data is true, can concurrent handle_message calls in SerializerService cause race conditions on the cached SafetyData leading to stale reads? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Error handling] [Panic in remote_service::execute()] The execute() function has a loop that catches errors with warn! but continues - can accumulating errors eventually cause state corruption without crashing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Error handling] [Storage write failures] If PersistentSafetyStorage.set_safety_data() fails during a critical vote operation, does the safety rules service crash or continue with stale cached data, risking double-voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Error handling] [Network read/write errors] When NetworkServer.read() or write() fail in process_one_message(), are they handled atomically, or can partial reads/writes cause message corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Error handling] [Silent failures] Does remote_service::execute() log all error conditions adequately, or can silent failures (e.g., unable to persist safety data) go unnoticed until a safety violation occurs? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Cryptography] [Key loading timing] When safety_rules_manager::storage() loads consensus private keys, are they loaded into memory securely without exposing them to swap or core dumps? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Cryptography] [Signature generation] Does the Process architecture ensure that signature generation via SafetyRules is atomic and cannot be interrupted mid-signing to leak partial key information? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Cryptography] [Key rotation] If consensus keys are rotated via overriding_identity_blobs, does Process::new() ensure the old key is securely erased from memory to prevent use-after-rotation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Integration] [SafetyRulesManager interaction] When SafetyRulesManager creates a ProcessService via new_process(), can it verify the remote safety rules process is actually running before returning, or will the first client call fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Integration] [Epoch manager coordination] During epoch transitions, if EpochManager creates a new Process, does it ensure the old process is terminated before starting the new one to avoid conflicting safety data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Integration] [Consensus integration] Can the consensus module accidentally bypass ProcessService and directly access PersistentSafetyStorage, allowing safety rule violations without process isolation? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Edge cases] [Empty server address] What happens if RemoteService.server_address is an empty string or invalid NetworkAddress - does Process::new() panic immediately or during start()? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Edge cases] [Localhost vs external binding] If server_address is localhost but ProcessService client tries to connect from external IP, will the connection fail, and how does this affect validator availability? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Edge cases] [ProcessData move semantics] Since ProcessData is moved via Option.take() in start(), can this cause use-after-move bugs if any other code tries to access self.data after start()? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/safety-rules/src/process.rs] [Edge cases] [Network timeout zero] If network_timeout_ms is 0 in SafetyRulesConfig, does this disable timeouts entirely (blocking forever) or cause immediate timeouts, and what is the security impact? (Medium)"
