  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: SerializationError] [Resource Limits] Does error handling for serialization properly enforce size limits, or could an attacker cause memory exhaustion through oversized serialized error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: EmptyBlocks] [Liveness Bypass] Can a malicious block proposer intentionally submit empty blocks to trigger EmptyBlocks errors and avoid executing transactions while still appearing to participate in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: EmptyBlocks] [Censorship Attack] Could the EmptyBlocks error be weaponized to censor specific transactions by claiming blocks are empty when they actually contain valid transactions, effectively halting transaction processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: EmptyBlocks] [Gas Economics] If empty blocks are rejected with EmptyBlocks error, can validators still collect rewards without processing transactions, breaking the economic security model? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: EmptyBlocks] [Edge Case] Does the check for empty blocks occur before or after state changes, and could race conditions allow empty blocks to be partially processed before rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: CouldNotGetData] [Timeout Exploitation] Can an attacker deliberately cause timeouts to trigger CouldNotGetData errors, forcing validators to skip critical state updates or block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: CouldNotGetData] [Network Partition] If CouldNotGetData occurs due to network issues, could this lead to validators making different execution decisions, causing state divergence and potential chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: CouldNotGetData] [Retry Logic] Does the system properly handle CouldNotGetData with appropriate retry logic, or could this error cause permanent data loss or stuck transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Variant: CouldNotGetData] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker measure timeout durations through CouldNotGetData errors to fingerprint validator performance or network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Error Context Loss] When converting from anyhow::Error to InternalError, is critical error context or stack traces lost that would be necessary for security incident investigation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<anyhow::Error>] [Type Erasure Attack] Can an attacker exploit the loss of type information during anyhow::Error conversion to obscure the root cause of critical failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [Storage Failure Masking] When AptosDbError is converted to InternalError, could critical database corruption or Byzantine behavior be masked as generic internal errors, preventing proper response? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<AptosDbError>] [State Inconsistency] If database errors occur during multi-step transactions, does the error conversion preserve enough information to ensure atomic rollback? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<StateViewError>] [State Access Violation] When StateViewError is converted to InternalError, could unauthorized state access attempts be hidden, allowing attackers to probe for accessible resources undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<StateViewError>] [Cache Poisoning] If StateViewError occurs due to cache inconsistencies, could the generic error conversion prevent detection of cache poisoning attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<bcs::Error>] [Deserialization Bomb] Does the bcs::Error conversion properly handle cases where malicious serialized data causes resource exhaustion before the error is raised? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Function: From<bcs::Error>] [Format String Attack] Can error messages from bcs::Error contain format string vulnerabilities when converted to SerializationError strings? (Low)",
