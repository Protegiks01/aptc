(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/abi.rs] [Struct: TransactionScriptABI] [Serialization inconsistency] Does the serde_bytes annotation on code ensure deterministic serialization, or can different serialization orders cause different hash values, breaking consensus on transaction ordering?
