  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalBackupOpt] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker specify max_chunk_size near usize::MAX causing integer overflow when adding record.len() + size_of::<u32>() in should_cut_chunk(), leading to buffer overflows and memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalBackupOpt] [Resource Exhaustion] Can max_chunk_size be set to an extremely large value (e.g., 10GB+) causing concurrent chunk downloads to exhaust node memory and crash validators during backup operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalBackupOpt] [DoS Attack] Can concurrent_data_requests be set to an arbitrarily high value (e.g., 10000) overwhelming the fullnode backup service and causing denial of service for legitimate backup operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalBackupOpt] [Configuration Bypass] Does the default value of max_chunk_size (134217728 bytes = 128MB) get validated against system memory limits, or can it cause OOM kills on resource-constrained nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalBackupOpt] [Data Integrity] If max_chunk_size is set below the size of critical records (state snapshots, large transactions), can this cause data to be silently truncated or corrupted during backup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: RocksdbOpt] [Resource Exhaustion] Can ledger_db_max_open_files and state_merkle_db_max_open_files be set to exceed system ulimit, causing restore operations to fail with file descriptor exhaustion and halting database recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: RocksdbOpt] [Integer Overflow] Can max_total_wal_size values (1073741824 bytes) overflow when summed across all DB instances (ledger + state_merkle + state_kv + index), exceeding disk space and corrupting database during restore? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: RocksdbOpt] [Configuration Inconsistency] If enable_storage_sharding is set to true but state_kv_db configuration is missing or misconfigured, can this cause state data to be written to wrong shards leading to state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: RocksdbOpt] [Race Condition] Can max_background_jobs be set to 1 causing RocksDB compactions to lag behind write operations, leading to unbounded WAL growth and disk exhaustion during high-throughput restores? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: RocksdbOpt] [Memory Exhaustion] Can block_cache_size be set to consume all available system memory, starving other critical processes and causing node crashes during restore operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Function: From<RocksdbOpt>] [Configuration Injection] Does the From trait implementation validate that max_open_files values are positive and within system limits before creating RocksdbConfig, or can negative values cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Function: From<RocksdbOpt>] [Default Override] Are critical security defaults (like max_background_jobs) preserved when converting RocksdbOpt to RocksdbConfigs, or can user-provided values override safety limits? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Path Traversal] Can db_dir accept paths like '../../../etc/passwd' allowing an attacker to write restored database files to arbitrary system locations and overwrite critical files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Logic Bypass] Does the conflicts_with = 'dry_run' constraint properly prevent db_dir from being set during dry runs, or can both flags be set simultaneously causing actual writes during verify-only operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Version Manipulation] If target_version is set to Version::MAX without proper validation, can this cause integer overflows when calculating version ranges or accessing arrays indexed by version? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [State Inconsistency] Can target_version be set to a version that doesn't correspond to an epoch boundary, causing restored state to be inconsistent with consensus rules and leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Waypoint Bypass] Can an attacker omit trusted_waypoints entirely, allowing restore of malicious state snapshots without cryptographic verification and compromising validator integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Race Condition] If concurrent_downloads is set extremely high while replay_concurrency_level is low, can this create thread starvation where download threads block replay threads causing restore deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/mod.rs] [Struct: GlobalRestoreOpt] [Index Manipulation] Does enable_state_indices properly validate that the restored indices match the restored state, or can indices be corrupted allowing invalid state queries after restore? (High)",
