  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: start_poller()] [Sampling Bias] Can the sample! macro usage at lines 294-302 cause important errors to be missed if they occur more frequently than POLLER_LOG_FREQ_SECS? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: start_poller()] [Concurrent Poll Launch] At lines 344-346, can rapidly iterating and calling poll_peer for multiple peers cause thread pool exhaustion if many peers are selected simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/poller.rs] [Function: start_poller()] [Interval Drift] Can the time_service.interval at line 279 drift over time, causing actual polling frequency to diverge from configured poll_loop_interval_ms? (Low)",
