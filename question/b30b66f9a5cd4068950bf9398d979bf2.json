  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Field ordering mismatch] If the Move definition of DepositEvent has fields in a different order than the Rust struct, can this cause incorrect deserialization of amount values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Type parameter mismatch] Does the Rust DepositEvent correctly match the generic type parameters of the Move coin::DepositEvent<CoinType>, or can type erasure cause events from different coin types to be confused? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Static: DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE] [TypeTag version compatibility] Can changes to Move's TypeTag representation break compatibility with DEPOSIT_EVENT_TYPE, causing event identification failures across protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Struct tag construction] Does struct_tag() method properly handle all edge cases in constructing StructTag from MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME, or can malformed tags bypass event validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS length prefix attack] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes with manipulated length prefixes that cause try_from_bytes() to read past buffer boundaries, potentially exposing sensitive memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [BCS canonical encoding] Does try_from_bytes() enforce canonical BCS encoding, or can multiple different byte representations deserialize to the same DepositEvent, breaking content-addressing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [BCS endianness] Is the u64 amount field correctly encoded/decoded in BCS little-endian format across all architectures, or can endianness issues cause amount value corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Empty byte array] Does try_from_bytes() handle empty byte slices gracefully with proper error messages, or can empty inputs cause panics or undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Partial deserialization] If BCS bytes contain a valid DepositEvent followed by extra data, does try_from_bytes() reject the input or silently accept it, potentially hiding malicious payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Event-balance mismatch] Can DepositEvents be emitted without corresponding balance increases in CoinStore, allowing attackers to fake deposits without actual fund transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Cross-transaction consistency] Can DepositEvents from one transaction be replayed or duplicated in subsequent transactions to inflate reported deposit volumes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Event persistence ordering] If events are persisted out of order relative to state changes, can race conditions cause DepositEvents to be associated with wrong transaction versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: amount()] [Immutability guarantee] Does the amount() getter return a copy of the amount value, or can callers obtain mutable references that violate event immutability? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Function: new()] [Economic validation] Does new(amount) validate that the amount corresponds to legitimate economic activity, or can synthetic events be created outside normal deposit flows? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/deposit_event.rs] [Struct: DepositEvent] [Reward gaming] If staking rewards or incentives are based on deposit event counts or amounts, can attackers game the system by emitting fake events? (High)",
