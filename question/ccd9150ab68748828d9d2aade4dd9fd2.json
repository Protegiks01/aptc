  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [First Match Bias] Does the function break after finding the first matching sample, potentially missing additional metrics that should be aggregated for accurate connection counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Trait: Checker] [Async Race Condition] Can multiple concurrent check() calls on the same MinimumPeersChecker instance cause data races when accessing the shared config field? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Await Point Cancellation] If the check() future is dropped while awaiting provider.provide(), can this leave the provider in an inconsistent state that affects subsequent checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Async Task Starvation] Can a slow or hanging provider.provide() call block the async executor, preventing other checkers from running and causing the entire health check system to stall? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersChecker] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone trait on MinimumPeersCheckerConfig properly clone all fields, or can shallow clones cause aliasing issues when configs are shared across threads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: ProviderCollection] [Provider Lifetime] Does the ProviderCollection guarantee that target_metrics_provider remains valid for the lifetime of the check() call, or can it be dropped causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Message Injection] Can attacker-controlled error messages from the provider (via format!('{:#}', e)) inject ANSI escape codes or other terminal control sequences to manipulate operator terminals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Recovery] When scraping metrics fails, does returning a single error result prevent retry logic, potentially hiding transient network issues as permanent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Partial Success Handling] When only one of inbound or outbound metrics is present, does the function properly handle partial success, or does it treat it as total failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [String Formatting Injection] Can attacker-controlled values (connections, minimum) be injected into the format! strings to create misleading explanations or inject escape sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty Result Vector] Could the function ever return an empty Vec<CheckResult>, causing downstream consumers that expect at least one result to panic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Zero Connections Edge Case] When both inbound and outbound connections are 0, does the function correctly report this, or can zero values be misinterpreted as missing metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Score Integer Overflow] Can the hardcoded score values (100, 50) cause integer overflow in aggregate scoring systems that sum scores from multiple checkers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [U64 Max Value] When metric values approach u64::MAX, can arithmetic operations on these values cause overflow, leading to incorrect connection counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [Float to U64 Conversion] Can extremely large float values (e.g., > 2^64) cause round() to produce values that overflow when cast to u64? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: get_metric_value()] [Subnormal Float Handling] Can subnormal float values near zero be incorrectly rounded to 0, hiding small but non-zero connection counts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: default_minimum_peers_inbound()] [Zero Default Security] Does allowing inbound connections to be 0 by default create a security vulnerability where fullnodes can operate without serving any peers, reducing network resilience? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: default_minimum_peers_outbound()] [Sybil Attack Vector] Does requiring only 1 outbound connection by default enable sybil attacks where an attacker controls that single connection to isolate the node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Missing Max Validation] Is there a maximum value check for minimum_peers_inbound and minimum_peers_outbound, or can operators set unrealistically high values that cause all nodes to fail validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Inbound/Outbound Symmetry] Should there be validation that minimum_peers_inbound and minimum_peers_outbound are reasonably balanced, or can extreme asymmetry (e.g., 1000 inbound, 1 outbound) indicate misconfiguration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Constant: METRIC] [Metric Deprecation] If the 'aptos_connections' metric is renamed or deprecated, does the hardcoded metric name cause the checker to silently fail without warning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Static: INBOUND_LABEL] [Label Value Change] If the Aptos metrics system changes the label value from 'inbound' to something else (e.g., 'incoming'), does the checker fail gracefully or silently pass disconnected nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Static: OUTBOUND_LABEL] [Label Key Change] If the label key changes from 'direction' to 'conn_type', does the static label matching break, causing all validation to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Integration: Label] [Lazy Static Initialization] Does the Lazy<Label> static initialization handle concurrent access safely, or can race conditions during first access cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
