  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_session()] [Resolver lifetime] Is the resolver's lifetime properly bounded to prevent the session from outliving it, causing use-after-free or dangling pointer dereferences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_session()] [Concurrent session creation] Can multiple threads create sessions concurrently with the same or different resolvers, causing race conditions in shared VM state or caches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_session()] [Environment staleness] Can the cloned environment in self.env become stale (outdated features, old VM config) while sessions are still being created from it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Function: new_session()] [Session state isolation] Does SessionExt::new properly isolate each session's state, or can sessions leak data through shared extensions or caches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Genesis-to-production transition] Can genesis-only privileges (unlimited gas, unlimited storage) leak into post-genesis sessions through improper state isolation or config reuse? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [VM instance isolation] Do GenesisRuntimeBuilder, GenesisMoveVm, and MoveVmExt properly isolate their states, or can operations on one affect others through shared static state or global variables? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Feature flag consistency] Are feature flags guaranteed to be consistent across all three VM types (genesis runtime, genesis VM, regular VM), or can feature mismatches cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Gas parameter transition] How is the transition from zero gas parameters (genesis) to production gas parameters handled, and can this transition be exploited to execute expensive operations with zero cost? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Cloning security] Since all three structs use cloning (RuntimeEnvironment, Features, VMConfig, AptosEnvironment), are all clones deep copies, or can shallow cloning create shared mutable state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Chain ID propagation] Is chain_id consistently propagated through all VM layers, or can chain_id mismatches between builder, VM, and sessions cause cross-chain attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Resolver trust model] Are resolvers assumed to be trusted, or are there validation mechanisms to detect malicious resolvers that return corrupted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Session ID uniqueness] Is there a global mechanism ensuring session_id uniqueness across all session types (Genesis, Txn, Prologue, Epilogue, etc.), or can collisions occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Version synchronization] Can LATEST_GAS_FEATURE_VERSION become out of sync with actual gas schedule versions deployed on-chain, causing validation to pass but execution to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Architectural] [Native function consistency] Are native functions registered identically between genesis and production VMs, or can differences enable genesis-specific natives to be called post-genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Rust] [Borrow checker bypass] Can the use of interior mutability (Arc, RefCell) in cloned environments bypass Rust's borrow checker and allow concurrent mutation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Rust] [Lifetime elision] Are all lifetime parameters properly specified in function signatures, or can elided lifetimes cause references to outlive their referents? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Rust] [Clone trait safety] Do all cloned types implement Clone correctly with proper deep copying, or can clone() implementations introduce aliasing bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/vm.rs] [Rust] [Drop handler ordering] Is the drop order of GenesisRuntimeBuilder fields deterministic, or can non-deterministic drops cause resource leaks or use-after-free? (Medium)",
