  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: block] [Epoch mismatch] Can a block from a different epoch be wrapped in a VoteProposal, causing validators to vote on blocks from wrong epochs and breaking epoch boundary invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: block] [Transaction payload validation] Does VoteProposal validate that the block's transactions are well-formed and within gas limits, or can malformed transactions be voted on? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: next_epoch_state] [Premature epoch transition] Can next_epoch_state be set to Some() for non-reconfiguration blocks, triggering unintended epoch transitions that fork the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: next_epoch_state] [Validator set injection] Can an attacker inject a next_epoch_state with unauthorized validators that gets committed through voting, allowing Sybil attacks on consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: next_epoch_state] [Voting power manipulation] Can the next_epoch_state contain manipulated voting powers that favor malicious validators, breaking the Byzantine tolerance threshold? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: decoupled_execution] [Mode inconsistency] Can validators have different decoupled_execution values for the same VoteProposal, causing some to verify proofs and others to use dummy hashes, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: decoupled_execution] [Flag injection] Can the decoupled_execution flag be modified after VoteProposal creation through unsafe code or serialization attacks, bypassing security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: decoupled_execution] [Network configuration mismatch] If the network transitions from coupled to decoupled execution, can old VoteProposals with decoupled_execution=false cause validators to fail verification and halt? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Field: decoupled_execution] [Verification bypass] Since decoupled_execution=true skips proof verification in gen_vote_data(), can an attacker force this mode to vote on invalid state transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Type: VoteData] [Proposed/parent mismatch] Can the VoteData created by gen_vote_data() have a proposed BlockInfo that doesn't properly chain to the parent BlockInfo, breaking the blockchain's linked structure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Type: VoteData] [Execution state divergence] If different validators generate different VoteData from the same VoteProposal due to timing or execution differences, could this cause vote fragmentation and liveness loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Type: VoteData] [Signature validation] Does VoteData get properly signed after generation, or can unsigned vote data be broadcast, enabling vote forgery attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Integer overflow in lengths] Can the serialized lengths of accumulator_extension_proof.leaves cause integer overflow when deserializing, leading to buffer overflows? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/vote_proposal.rs] [Serde bound at line 23] [Generic deserialization] Does the custom serde bound for Block deserialization properly validate all block fields, or can malformed blocks bypass validation? (High)",
