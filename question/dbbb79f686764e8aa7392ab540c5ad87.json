  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Struct: Command] [Waypoint Parsing] The waypoint_to_verify is parsed from command-line string - does Waypoint::from_str() properly validate format and prevent injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Struct: Command] [Flag Confusion] The --commit flag requires waypoint_to_verify (line 37) - but could an attacker bypass this requirement through clap parser bugs or flag ordering tricks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Struct: Command] [Missing Validation] Are there any constraints on db_dir (must be empty, must not exist, must be absolute path) that should be validated but aren't? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Struct: Command] [Unicode in Paths] Can Unicode characters in db_dir or genesis_txn_file paths cause issues on different filesystems or during path normalization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [TOCTOU Race] Between waypoint verification at line 89 and commit at line 97, could another process modify the database, causing committed state to differ from verified state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Multiple Bootstrappers] If multiple bootstrap.rs instances run simultaneously with the same db_dir, could race conditions cause database corruption despite exclusive locks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Signal Handling] If the process receives SIGTERM or SIGKILL during commit(), does it leave the database in a clean state or require crash recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: load_genesis_txn()] [File Modification Race] If the genesis file is being written while load_genesis_txn() reads it, could partial reads cause deserialization to succeed with corrupted data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Validator Set Bootstrap] Does genesis properly initialize the validator set with correct public keys and voting power? Could an attacker create a genesis with fake validators controlling > 2/3 stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Epoch State Validation] Is the EpochState in genesis validated to have enough validators (> 3f+1 for f Byzantine faults)? Could a genesis with insufficient validators halt consensus immediately? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Signature Verification] During genesis, are validator signatures properly verified, or is signing skipped allowing any genesis to be applied without cryptographic proof? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Aggregate Signature Empty] The AggregateSignature::empty() in calculate_genesis() means genesis has no signatures - is this secure, or could it allow replay attacks on other chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Chain ID Validation] Does genesis include and validate the chain_id to prevent transactions from one network being replayed on another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Genesis Block Hash] Is the genesis_block_id() deterministic and collision-resistant? Could different genesis transactions produce the same block ID causing consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [State Root Verification] After genesis execution, is the state root hash properly computed and stored in the Merkle tree? Could mismatches between storage and Merkle tree cause verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Transaction Accumulator] Does genesis properly initialize the transaction accumulator with the genesis transaction? Could empty accumulator cause issues when appending first post-genesis transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Event Emission] Does genesis transaction emit required NewEpochEvent and NewBlockEvent? Missing events could break state sync and consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Reconfig Event] Is the reconfiguration event properly emitted during genesis to signal validator set initialization? Without it, could consensus fail to start? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Module Publishing] If genesis includes module publishing transactions, are they validated to not override existing core framework modules causing protocol instability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Resource Initialization] Are all required framework resources (Timestamp, Configuration, ValidatorSet, StakingConfig) properly initialized in genesis? Missing resources could break protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Initial Supply] Does genesis properly account for the initial APT supply? Could an attacker create a genesis with unlimited initial minting causing inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/db-tool/src/bootstrap.rs] [Function: Command::run()] [Staking Initialization] Are validator staking pools properly initialized with correct locked stake amounts? Could incorrect initialization allow immediate unstaking breaking consensus? (High)",
