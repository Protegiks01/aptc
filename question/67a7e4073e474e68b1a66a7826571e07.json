(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: ProverTest::create()] [Test Name Collision] If multiple tests use the same relative path, can this cause verification results to be mixed up or cached incorrectly? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/prove.rs] [Function: Prove::execute()] [Options Enum Confusion] The match on options at lines 56-59 only handles ProverOptions::Options - can the external_subcommand attribute cause unexpected variants that bypass this match? (Medium)",
