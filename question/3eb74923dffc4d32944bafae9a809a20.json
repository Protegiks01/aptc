(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_bundle.rs] [Function: sort_by_deps()] [Stack overflow] Can an attacker craft a release bundle with deeply nested module dependencies causing the recursive sort_by_deps() at lines 316-334 to overflow the stack, crashing validators during governance proposal validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_bundle.rs] [Function: sort_by_deps()] [Circular dependency hang] Can an attacker create circular dependencies between modules that cause sort_by_deps() at line 330 to enter an infinite recursion loop, hanging validator nodes indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_bundle.rs] [Function: sorted_code_and_modules()] [Dependency confusion] Can an attacker craft modules with dependency relationships that cause sort_by_deps() to produce an incorrect topological order, leading to deployment failures or modules being deployed before their dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/release_bundle.rs] [Function: sort_by_deps()] [Missing module panic] Does the .unwrap() at line 324 mean that if a module references a dependency not in the map, the validator crashes, allowing attackers to DoS proposal validation? (High)",
