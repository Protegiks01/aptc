  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Static assertion: assert_not_impl_any!] [Build configuration attack] Can an attacker modify Cargo.toml or build flags to disable the static assertion feature in a supply chain attack, allowing cloneable secrets in compromised builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Serialization clone] Even if Clone is prevented, could serializing and deserializing an InputSecret effectively create a clone, bypassing the protection if Serialize/Deserialize are ever added? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Reference clone] Can creating multiple references to an InputSecret and then using unsafe pointer manipulation effectively clone the secret's memory contents despite Clone prevention? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Zero input attack] In the PVSS dealing protocol, if a malicious validator provides InputSecret::zero() as their secret input, can this cause the dealing to fail, produce invalid shares, or bias the final reconstructed secret toward zero? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Add] [Aggregation attack] When multiple validators' InputSecrets are aggregated through addition in threshold PVSS protocols, can a Byzantine validator inject specially crafted secrets that sum to known values, allowing them to predict or control the aggregated secret? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: generate()] [Dealing restart attack] The documentation states that if a validator crashes during dealing, the task restarts with a fresh InputSecret - can an attacker repeatedly crash validators during dealing to force regeneration until a weak or exploitable secret is generated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Convert trait vulnerability] The comment mentions InputSecrets are 'converted to DealtSecretKey via the Convert trait' - can bugs in this conversion process leak information about the input secret or produce incorrect dealt secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Polynomial constant term] InputSecrets are used as the constant term of Shamir polynomials - if the secret is zero, does this create a zero polynomial that breaks secret sharing security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Add] [Share distribution bias] When adding InputSecrets from multiple dealers in weighted PVSS, can unequal contributions cause bias in the share distribution that favors certain validators or allows collusion to predict shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Resharing vulnerability] In PVSS resharing protocols where old InputSecrets are combined to form new secrets, can an attacker who compromised one historical secret use it to bias or predict future reshared secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Cross-protocol reuse] If the same InputSecret is accidentally reused across multiple PVSS dealing instances or different DKG sessions, can this completely break security by allowing correlation attacks or secret recovery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Epoch transition attack] During validator set changes or epoch transitions, if InputSecrets are regenerated or carried over improperly, can Byzantine validators exploit the transition to learn secrets or manipulate the new DKG output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Add] [Additive homomorphism exploit] Can the additive homomorphic property of InputSecrets be exploited by malicious validators to create linear relationships between their secret inputs and the final DKG output, enabling partial secret recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Threshold bypass] In t-of-n threshold PVSS schemes, if t validators collude and share their InputSecrets, can they reconstruct the aggregated secret before the dealing is complete, breaking the threshold security property? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Zero] [Zero handling consistency] Does the PVSS protocol properly handle InputSecret::zero() edge cases, or can zero secrets cause divisions by zero, invalid polynomial evaluations, or other mathematical errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: is_zero()] [Zero detection inconsistency] Can there be multiple representations of zero in the scalar field that cause is_zero() to return false for a mathematically-zero secret, leading to incorrect protocol behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Maximum scalar value] If an InputSecret contains a scalar at or near the maximum field value (SCALAR_FIELD_ORDER - 1), can addition operations cause unexpected wraparound behavior that breaks PVSS security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add()] [Repeated addition overflow] When the same InputSecret is added to itself multiple times in aggregation protocols, can accumulated scalar values exceed field bounds in ways that aren't properly handled by modular reduction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: Zero] [Negative zero] Does the scalar field have a negative zero representation (e.g., -0 vs +0), and if so, does is_zero() correctly identify both as zero to prevent protocol inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG edge states] Can the RNG be in edge states (e.g., just-initialized, nearly-exhausted entropy) that cause random_scalar() to return boundary values like 0 or SCALAR_FIELD_ORDER-1 more frequently than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Very large aggregations] When hundreds of InputSecrets are added together in large-scale PVSS protocols, can floating-point representation issues or numerical instability in the underlying field arithmetic cause correctness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Trait: PartialEq] [NaN-equivalent values] Can there be 'NaN-equivalent' scalar values that fail equality comparisons with themselves (a != a), breaking protocol logic that relies on InputSecret equality checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [Lack of Sync/Send] Does InputSecret implement Send/Sync traits, and if not, can this cause issues when PVSS dealing needs to happen across threads in concurrent validator implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Function: add_assign()] [Concurrent mutation] If multiple threads attempt to use AddAssign on the same InputSecret concurrently (through Arc<Mutex<InputSecret>> or similar), can race conditions in the scalar field arithmetic cause data races or inconsistent values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/input_secret.rs] [Struct: InputSecret] [RNG thread safety] When multiple threads call Uniform::generate() concurrently to create InputSecrets, is the underlying RNG properly synchronized, or can concurrent access cause RNG state corruption leading to predictable secrets?
