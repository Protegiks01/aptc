  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: run_one()] [Canonicalization failure] When cli_binary.canonicalize() fails, how is the error handled - can this lead to executing a different binary than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: run_one()] [Trace file canonicalization timing] The trace file path is canonicalized before tests run - can changes to the filesystem during test execution cause the trace file to be written to an unexpected location? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: collect_coverage()] [Build dir canonicalization] If build_dir canonicalization fails during coverage collection, does it properly propagate the error or could it use an uncanonicalized path? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: run_one()] [Global state pollution] The unsafe environment variable mutations affect global process state - is run_one() guaranteed to be called from a single thread, or can parallel test execution corrupt state? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: copy_deps()] [Dev mode dependency confusion] The code uses dev_mode: true in BuildConfig - can this cause test dependencies to differ from production, hiding security bugs that only manifest in release mode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/test/mod.rs] [Function: copy_deps()] [Resolution graph manipulation] Can malicious Move.toml files specify cyclic dependencies that cause resolution_graph_for_package() to hang or return incorrect dependency graphs? (Medium)",
