  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Maximum TPS limits] There's no upper bound on TPS values - can extremely high reported TPS (e.g., trillions) cause integer overflow when converting from f64 to u64 in error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty target vector] If repeat_target_count is 0, the targets vector is empty - does Cluster::try_from_cluster_args() handle this gracefully, or does it panic or return invalid clusters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Minimum TPS of 1] If minimum_tps is set to 1, does the f64 comparison with rate.committed correctly handle values like 0.9999 that might round differently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [repeat_target_count of usize::MAX] Can setting repeat_target_count to usize::MAX cause memory allocation failures or integer overflow when multiplying by URL string size? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Unwrap panic vectors] Multiple .unwrap() calls exist without error handling - in production, can any of these panic and crash the entire node health checker service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsChecker] [Dead code warnings] The struct has #[allow(dead_code)] annotation - does this hide unused fields that should be validated or might contain security-relevant data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Enum: TpsCheckerError] [Error type exhaustiveness] The error enum has three variants - are all possible error conditions from dependencies properly mapped, or can panics occur from unmapped errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Trait: async_trait] [Async trait overhead] Using async_trait adds boxing overhead - can this impact performance during high-volume TPS checking, potentially causing timeouts or resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Clone operations] coin_source_args is cloned when building ClusterArgs - does this properly deep-clone the private key, or can the clone be mutated to affect subsequent checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Gas cost manipulation] The emit_config controls transaction emission but TPS is measured by count, not gas - can an attacker send zero-gas transactions to inflate TPS while doing minimal work? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Fee market gaming] If the target node uses dynamic fees, can it artificially lower fees during TPS testing to accept more transactions, then raise them in production to reject user transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: CoinSourceArgs] [Minting cost exploitation] Using a mint key bypasses normal transaction fees - can this give an unrealistic TPS measurement that doesn't reflect real-world conditions with fee-paying transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Account balance exhaustion] If coin_source_args points to a regular account (not mint authority), can repeated TPS tests drain the account and cause subsequent checks to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [TOCTOU in chain ID] The chain_id is fetched at the start but used later to build cluster - can the target node's chain ID change between check and use, causing transactions to be sent to wrong chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [TOCTOU in provider state] The target_api_index_provider might change between retrieval and use - can race conditions cause stale provider data to be used for transaction emission? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: new()] [TOCTOU in config validation] The private key is validated in new() but the config is used later in check() - can the config be mutated between construction and use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [TOCTOU in URL building] The target_url is built and then duplicated - if the underlying client's base URL changes, can this cause inconsistent target lists? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [TPS check replay] Can the same TpsChecker instance be used multiple times, and if so, does this cause nonce reuse or other replay vulnerabilities in emitted transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Cross-node replay] If multiple nodes are checked with the same TpsChecker configuration, can transactions intended for one node be replayed against another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: CoinSourceArgs] [Key reuse across checks] The same coin_source_args private key is used for all TPS checks - can signatures or nonces from one check be replayed in another to drain funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Stats object reuse] The stats object is used for multiple comparisons - can cached or stale stats from previous checks contaminate current check results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Macro: get_provider!] [Required flag bypass] The get_provider! macro checks common.required flag - can an attacker set required=false to skip provider validation and bypass TPS checks entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: ProviderCollection] [Provider substitution] Can an attacker replace the target_api_index_provider in the collection with a malicious implementation that always returns passing TPS values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Trait: Provider] [Provide() method spoofing] The provide() method returns arbitrary response data - can a malicious provider return crafted responses that exploit parsing vulnerabilities in chain_id handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Dependency version mismatch] The code depends on aptos_transaction_emitter_lib - can version mismatches cause ABI incompatibilities that lead to incorrect TPS measurements or crashes? (Low)"
