  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Block Gas Accumulation] Can get_auxiliary_info() return inconsistent gas information causing block gas limit calculations to diverge across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/mod.rs] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a block with maximum num_txns() to exhaust validator resources during parallel execution initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Iterator Ordering] Does the all() iterator in get_auxiliary_info() traverse auxiliary_info in a deterministic order, or can non-determinism cause validators to disagree on version behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/mod.rs] [Reference Determinism] Can get_txn() return references to different memory locations for the same transaction across validators, breaking pointer-based equality checks? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/blocking_txns_provider.rs] [Dead Code] Is BlockingTxnProvider truly dead code, or is it used in specific execution modes that could trigger the unimplemented!() panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [TODO Comment] The TODO comment in blocking_txns_provider.rs line 39 indicates incomplete implementation - can this be exploited if the code path is activated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/mod.rs] [Trait Evolution] If new methods are added to TxnProvider trait in future versions, can this break existing implementations and cause validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Byzantine Block Proposer] Can a Byzantine validator propose a block with mismatched txns and auxiliary_info lengths that passes the assertion but later causes execution failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay transactions with stale auxiliary info causing validators to execute transactions with incorrect metadata? (High)",
