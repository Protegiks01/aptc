  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Eviction Policy] Does the trait specify cache eviction policies, or can unbounded growth allow memory exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Replay Protection] Can cached scripts be replayed across different transaction contexts without proper validation of execution preconditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Feature Gating] Does the trait allow implementations to respect feature flags that disable or enable script execution capabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Upgrade Safety] During protocol upgrades that change script verification rules, can stale cached scripts bypass new security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Cross-Chain] If Aptos implements cross-chain functionality, can the fixed trait bounds accommodate scripts from different chain contexts safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Blanket Implementation] [Generic Constraints] Does the automatic implementation prevent specialized optimizations needed for high-throughput parallel execution? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Dependency Resolution] Can circular dependencies between cached scripts and modules cause infinite loops or stack overflows during resolution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Signature Verification] Does the trait ensure that cached scripts maintain their signature verification status, or can unverified bytecode be cached? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Namespace Isolation] Can the combination of module and script storage cause namespace collisions that allow privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/code_storage.rs] [Trait: CodeStorage] [Monotonicity] Does the trait enforce monotonic properties where once a script is verified, it cannot be replaced with an unverified version? (High)"
