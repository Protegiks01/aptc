  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Gas] [Structure-Specific Costs] Are gas costs (ALGEBRA_ARK_BLS12_381_FR_MUL vs FQ12_MUL vs BN254) properly calibrated to actual CPU costs, or can attackers exploit mispricing for economic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Gas] [DoS via Gas Exhaustion] Can attackers craft transactions that maximize gas consumption through repeated mul_internal calls without reaching memory limits, causing validator slowdowns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Gas] [Partial Charge on Error] If safe_borrow_element fails AFTER gas is charged, do attackers lose gas without completing work, or is gas refunded creating an opportunity for gas manipulation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Feature Flags] [Race Condition] Can feature flags be modified via governance while mul_internal is executing, causing TOCTOU issues where operations start when enabled but complete after disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Feature Flags] [Bypass via None] When structure_opt is None, the abort_unless_arithmetics_enabled_for_structure! macro may not properly check flags - can this be exploited to perform operations without flag checks?

  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/mul.rs] [Feature Flags] [Partial Enablement] If only BLS12_381_STRUCTURES is enabled but not BN254_STRUCTURES, does this create asymmetry that can be exploited for cross-curve attacks? (Medium)",
