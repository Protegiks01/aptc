(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Constant: EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_ADDRESS] [Privilege Escalation] Can experimental modules leverage their deployment at a privileged address (0x7) to gain unauthorized access to system resources or bypass normal access controls? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Constant: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [VM Status Manipulation] Can attackers exploit the CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE constant in error handling to forge VM status codes that bypass transaction validation or hide malicious failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/constants/mod.rs] [Constant: CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE] [Account Module Replacement] Is CORE_ACCOUNT_MODULE properly protected against replacement attacks where malicious actors deploy alternative 'account' modules at address 0x1 to hijack account operations?
