  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: Type] [Derived Ord] The Type enum derives Ord for ordering. Does the ordering of Var types depend on their numeric ID, allowing an attacker to influence unification order by controlling variable IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::is_compatible_num_type()] [Num type wildcard] The function treats Num as compatible with any integer type. Can an attacker use this in implementation code to bypass concrete type requirements, leading to operations on incorrect integer widths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: TypeUnificationError] [Error propagation] Multiple functions return TypeUnificationError but some callers ignore errors or use default values. Can an attacker trigger error conditions that should halt type checking but are silently handled, allowing invalid types to proceed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: TypeUnificationError::redirect()] [Error location manipulation] The function changes the location where error is reported. Can an attacker trigger errors at sensitive locations then redirect them to confuse debuggers or hide the true error source? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: TypeUnificationError::lift()] [Critical pair loss] The function lifts errors from critical pair to context type, potentially losing information about where types disagree. Can this obscure type mismatches in nested structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: TypeUnificationError::specific_loc()] [Location skipping] The function returns None for certain constraint errors, reporting them at expression location instead. Can an attacker craft constraints that hide their origin, making debugging impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::module_usage()] [Module dependency tracking] The function tracks which modules a type uses. Can an attacker create circular module dependencies through type references that cause infinite loops during module resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::get_struct_id()] [Qualified ID construction] The function constructs QualifiedInstId from struct environment. Can an attacker provide mismatched module_id and struct_id that pass validation but resolve to wrong struct at runtime? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::require_struct()] [Panic on non-struct] The function panics if type is not a struct. Can an attacker trigger this panic during transaction validation, causing validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::replace_struct_instantiation()] [Instantiation replacement] The function replaces type parameters only for Struct types. Can an attacker exploit this to bypass type parameter substitution in other type constructors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: ConstraintContext] [Context propagation] The inferred flag propagates through type checking. Can an attacker craft code where inferred types have weaker constraints than explicitly annotated types, bypassing safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: ConstraintOrigin] [Origin tracking] The TypeParameter origin can have nested parents. Can an attacker create deeply nested type parameter chains that cause stack overflow during error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: ConstraintContext::derive_struct_parameter()] [Context derivation] The function creates derived contexts for struct parameters. Can an attacker create conflicting contexts for the same type variable, leading to inconsistent error messages or constraint evaluation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: ConstraintOrigin::describe()] [Recursive description] The function recursively describes constraint origins. Can an attacker create cycles in origins (parent pointing back to self) causing infinite recursion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: Variance] [Variance mode switching] The sub_variance() function changes ShallowSpecVariance to NoVariance. Can an attacker exploit shallow variance at top level to bypass stricter checks in nested types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: Variance] [Function argument variance] The fun_argument_variance() function treats inline functions specially. Can an attacker mark regular functions as inline to gain relaxed type checking for arguments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Enum: WideningOrder] [Order manipulation] The combine() and swap() functions change widening direction. Can an attacker influence type checking order to prefer widening in one direction over another, bypassing type restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Substitution::unify()] [Spec variance reference dropping] With spec variance, references are dropped from both sides. Can an attacker unify &T with &mut T in spec mode, losing mutability information that's needed in implementation mode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: TypeDisplayContext] [Recursive variable display] The recursive_vars field prevents infinite loops in display. Can an attacker craft types where display succeeds but actual type checking enters infinite loop due to recursion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Struct: TypeDisplayContext] [Module qualification] The use_module_qualification flag changes display format. Can inconsistent display between contexts cause confusion in error messages, hiding the true type? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: TypeDisplayContext::is_imported_module()] [Import checking] The function checks used_modules and use_decls. Can an attacker create modules with same name in different addresses, causing type display to use wrong qualification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: TypeDisplay::struct_str()] [Address shortening] The function uses short_str_lossless() for addresses. Can address collisions in short format cause type confusion in displayed types? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::type_param_map_to_inst()] [Partial instantiation] The function creates instantiation with gaps filled by Type::new_param(). Can an attacker provide partial map leaving some parameters uninstantiated but appearing instantiated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::instantiate_vec()] [Empty params optimization] The function returns input vec if params is empty. Can an attacker exploit this to share type vectors across contexts, leading to mutation visibility issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/ty.rs] [Function: Type::replace()] [Visiting set mutation] The function uses BTreeSet to track visiting variables. Can an attacker cause the set to not be properly cleaned up on error paths, affecting subsequent type operations? (Medium)"
