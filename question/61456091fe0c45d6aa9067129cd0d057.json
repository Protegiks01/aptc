  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Gas: Event gas] [Event emission cost] Are events in the ChangeSet properly charged for gas based on their size, or can attackers emit massive events within a single transaction bypassing per-event gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Limits: Maximum size] [Transaction output size] Is there an enforced maximum size for a ChangeSet, or can a transaction produce gigabytes of state changes that must be propagated through consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Special: Genesis] [Genesis validation] Does the genesis transaction produce a ChangeSet that initializes all required system state, or can incomplete initialization cause bootstrap failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Special: Governance] [Governance execution] Can governance proposal execution produce a ChangeSet with unauthorized state changes (e.g., modifying validator set without proper voting), enabling governance attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Special: Reconfiguration] [Epoch transition] During epoch transitions, can the reconfiguration transaction's ChangeSet contain conflicting validator set updates causing consensus to fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Special: Block metadata] [Block epilogue] Does the block metadata transaction produce a ChangeSet that correctly updates validator rewards and fees, or can accounting errors cause fund creation/destruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Rust: Memory safety] [Unsafe operations] If unsafe code elsewhere constructs a ChangeSet bypassing new(), can it violate internal invariants causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Rust: Borrowing] [Lifetime issues] Can improper lifetime management of ChangeSet references cause use-after-free bugs in transaction execution pipelines? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Rust: Send/Sync] [Thread safety] Is ChangeSet properly Send+Sync for concurrent access, or can race conditions occur when multiple threads access the same ChangeSet during parallel block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Rust: Panic safety] [Panic handling] If a panic occurs while constructing or processing a ChangeSet, can it leave the WriteSet or events in an inconsistent state that persists? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Edge case: Empty events] [Empty vector] Can a ChangeSet with an empty events vector but non-empty WriteSet cause issues in systems that expect at least one event per transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Edge case: Large WriteSet] [Memory limits] Can a single ChangeSet contain a WriteSet with millions of state keys, causing memory exhaustion during deserialization or cloning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Edge case: Event ordering] [Deterministic order] If events are added to the vector in non-deterministic order (e.g., from a HashMap), can this cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Edge case: Zero-size WriteOps] [Empty writes] Can a WriteSet contain WriteOps with zero-byte state values, and do such writes properly overwrite existing state or cause storage inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Boundary: Maximum events] [Event limit] What is the maximum number of events a ChangeSet can contain, and can exceeding this limit cause silent truncation or validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Integration: API layer] [REST API] When ChangeSets are serialized for REST API responses, can malicious ChangeSets cause JSON serialization failures or expose sensitive internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Integration: Indexer] [Event indexing] Can a ChangeSet with malformed events cause indexer crashes or incorrect indexing, breaking off-chain application state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Integration: State sync] [Fast sync] During fast sync, can validators accept ChangeSets that haven't been properly validated, allowing state poisoning attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [Integration: Mempool] [Transaction verification] Before execution, can the mempool validate ChangeSet properties, or must all validation wait until consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/transaction/change_set.rs] [DoS: Processing time] [CPU exhaustion] Can a ChangeSet with pathologically structured WriteSets or events cause excessive CPU usage during validation or hashing? (Medium)",
