  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [Resource Group Metadata] For WriteResourceGroup at line 261, metadata_op() is called instead of extracting from individual resources - can this cause metadata inconsistencies if group metadata doesn't match aggregated member metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [Fallback Logic] When InPlaceDelayedFieldChange or ResourceGroupInPlaceDelayedFieldChange is encountered, the function falls back to base view - can this return stale metadata if the delayed field change should have updated metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [None Handling] When None is returned from change set lookup, base_executor_view is called - can this cause the metadata to be fetched from a different version than the actual resource value, causing version mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_metadata()] [Delayed Fields Metadata] For WriteWithDelayedFields, is the metadata extracted from write_op correct even though delayed fields are pending materialization? Can this cause incorrect size calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_size()] [Size Calculation] The bytes_size() is cast to u64 at line 280 - can this truncate on 32-bit systems or cause overflow if the actual size exceeds u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_size()] [Delayed Fields Size] When WriteOp contains delayed fields that haven't been materialized yet, does bytes_size() return the final size or temporary size? Can this cause incorrect gas calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_size()] [Deletion Size] When a resource is deleted (write_op is deletion), what size does bytes_size() return? Can returning non-zero for deleted resources cause incorrect state size accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_state_value_size()] [Fallback Consistency] When falling back to base_executor_view, can the size differ from what would be in the change set if the resource was modified but size wasn't updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists()] [Existence Check] The function checks if bytes().is_some() at line 288 - can a WriteOp have Some(empty_bytes) that incorrectly indicates existence when the resource should be considered deleted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists()] [Delayed Field Bypass] When InPlaceDelayedFieldChange causes fallback to base view, can this incorrectly return true for a resource that should be considered deleted due to pending delayed field changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads check resource_exists() concurrently while the change set is being modified, can they get inconsistent results causing transaction validation to fail non-deterministically? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_group_size()] [Size Accounting] The function uses maybe_group_op_size() which can return None, falling back to zero_combined() at line 308 - can this cause incorrect size accounting where a non-empty group reports zero size? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_group_size()] [Zero Combined] ResourceGroupSize::zero_combined() is used as default - can this value be confused with a legitimately empty group, causing logic errors in gas calculation or storage accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_group_size()] [Group Modification] When a resource group is modified in the change set but size isn't updated correctly in maybe_group_op_size(), can this cause the size to be stale or incorrect? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_from_group()] [Layout Randomized Check] The randomly_check_layout_matches() call at line 330 only sometimes validates layouts - can an attacker exploit the randomness to inject resources with wrong layouts that occasionally pass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_from_group()] [Raw Bytes Extraction] The extract_raw_bytes() method is called at line 331 - if this extracts bytes without proper validation, can it return corrupted data that causes deserialization errors downstream? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_from_group()] [Inner Ops Access] The function accesses group_write.inner_ops().get(resource_tag) - can this HashMap lookup fail to find resources that should exist if the tag format is inconsistent between change set and base view? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_from_group()] [Option Chaining] The .and_then() chain at line 320 can short-circuit - can this cause legitimate resources to be incorrectly fetched from base view instead of change set? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: get_resource_from_group()] [Deleted Resource] If a resource is deleted from a group (write_op is deletion), does extract_raw_bytes() return None correctly, or can it return Some(empty) causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_size_in_group()] [Size Type Mismatch] The function returns usize while get_resource_state_value_size() returns u64 - can this type mismatch cause truncation issues on systems where usize < u64?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_size_in_group()] [Deleted Resource Size] If write_op represents a deletion, what size does bytes_size() return? Can non-zero size for deleted resources cause incorrect accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Existence Logic] The function checks bytes().is_some() similar to resource_exists() - can empty bytes or special deletion markers cause incorrect existence reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Group Deletion] If the entire resource group is deleted but individual resources in inner_ops() still have Some bytes, can this cause resources to incorrectly appear to exist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: resource_exists_in_group()] [Tag Mismatch] If resource_tag uses different identifier formatting between change set and base view, can the same logical resource be found/not found inconsistently?
