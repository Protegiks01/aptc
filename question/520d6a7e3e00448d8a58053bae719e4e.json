(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Config Mutation] Since start_viewer() takes &self at line 51, is there any risk of the config being modified during execution, or can the paths change between validation and use? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BytecodeViewerConfig] [Command Injection] Can attackers inject shell metacharacters or command sequences into the path fields that might be executed if the paths are later used in shell commands or scripts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BytecodeViewerConfig] [Canonicalization Bypass] Are paths canonicalized before use, or can attackers use ./../../ sequences to bypass directory restrictions even if some path validation exists? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Viewer Ownership] The compiled_module is cloned at line 44 - does this create two copies in memory, potentially doubling memory consumption for large modules and causing resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Thread Safety] Is the Viewer interface thread-safe, or can concurrent access to the TUI cause data races, particularly if start_tui_with_interface() spawns multiple threads for input handling and rendering? (Medium)",
