  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Does the LogSchema struct's use of #[schema(debug)] attribute on the error field at line 13 expose sensitive internal error details (like validator signatures, cryptographic keys, or state machine internals) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can the message field (line 15) be exploited to log sensitive consensus data (like uncommitted block proposals, validator vote details, or private network topology) that should not be exposed in production logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Privacy Leak] Does the #[schema(display)] attribute on peer field (line 18) expose full PeerNetworkId information including validator identities that could enable targeted attacks or censorship by malicious network observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Injection] Is the message field (line 15) properly sanitized before logging, or can an attacker inject malicious content through crafted network messages that manipulate log parsers or monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Validation] Does the request_id field (line 19) lack bounds checking, allowing attackers to log extremely large u64 values that could cause log storage exhaustion or overflow in log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing Initialization] Does the new() function (lines 24-35) fail to validate or sanitize the LogEntry parameter, potentially allowing invalid log entries that could corrupt log integrity or monitoring dashboards? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Type Confusion] Can the message_type and request_type fields (lines 16, 20) be set to arbitrary strings that cause type confusion in log parsing, potentially hiding malicious consensus activity or attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Missing Fields] Does LogSchema lack critical security-relevant fields like timestamp, node_id, epoch, or round that would be necessary to detect consensus attacks or reconstruct attack timelines during incident response? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Error Information Disclosure] When logging Error types from consensus_observer::common::error, does the debug formatting expose internal state details like validator set compositions, consensus round information, or subscription states that attackers could use to time attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Sensitive Data in Errors] Can Error types containing RpcError (from line 22 of error.rs) leak sensitive network topology, connection states, or peer capabilities through logged error messages that enable network-level attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Missing Variants] Does the LogEntry enum (lines 40-46) lack specific variants for critical security events (like Byzantine behavior detection, double-signing attempts, or invalid quorum certificates), making it impossible to audit such attacks through logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Serialization] Does the #[serde(rename_all = 'snake_case')] attribute (line 39) on LogEntry introduce serialization vulnerabilities if log data is deserialized from untrusted sources, potentially allowing attackers to inject fake log entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Ambiguous Logging] Are the LogEntry variants ConsensusObserver and ConsensusPublisher (lines 41-42) too generic, potentially conflating security-critical events with normal operations and making attack detection impossible in log analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Missing Context] Does SendDirectSendMessage and SendRpcRequest variants (lines 44-45) lack sufficient context about message destinations, potentially hiding targeted attacks against specific validators or consensus observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Insufficient Granularity] Does the InvalidRpcResponse variant (line 51) lack detail about what made the response invalid (signature failure, wrong epoch, corrupted data), preventing security teams from distinguishing between bugs and Byzantine attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Generic Error Category] Is the UnexpectedError variant (line 56) too broad, potentially lumping together critical consensus safety violations with benign errors, making it impossible to detect subtle Byzantine attacks through log monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Missing Security Events] Does LogEvent lack variants for critical consensus observer security events like 'SubscriptionHijacked', 'ByzantineBlockDetected', or 'ConsensusStateDivergence' that would be necessary to detect and respond to active attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Serialization Vulnerability] Can the serde serialization of LogEvent enum (line 48) be exploited if logs are parsed from external sources, allowing attackers to inject fake security events that trigger false alarms or hide real attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Deserialization Attack] If LogEntry or LogEvent enums are ever deserialized from network messages or external logs, could the Serialize derive macro (lines 38, 48) enable deserialization attacks that cause DoS or code execution in log processing systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Attribute: rename_all] [Case Sensitivity] Could the snake_case naming convention (lines 39, 49) introduce case-sensitivity bugs in log parsing that allow attackers to evade detection by using different capitalization in crafted error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Race Condition] Can concurrent access to LogSchema instances from multiple async tasks in consensus observer code cause interleaved log writes that corrupt the logical sequence of events, hiding consensus attacks or making incident analysis impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Reference Lifetime] Do the lifetime annotations ('a) on LogSchema (line 10) properly prevent use-after-free issues when logging errors or peer data that might be dropped before the log write completes in async contexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Resource Exhaustion] Can attackers flood consensus observers with malicious messages that trigger excessive logging through LogSchema, causing disk exhaustion or log rotation failures that prevent detection of subsequent legitimate attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Memory Leak] Does the use of Option types for all fields (lines 13-20) allow accumulated log metadata to consume excessive memory if LogSchema instances are created but never written, potentially causing validator OOM crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/common/logging.rs] [Derive: Schema] [Schema Macro Vulnerability] Does the aptos_logger::Schema derive macro (line 9) properly sanitize field data before logging, or can injected control characters in peer names or messages break log format integrity?
