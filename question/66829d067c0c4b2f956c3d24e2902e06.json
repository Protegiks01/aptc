  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: total_deposit()] [Deposit underflow] If slot_deposit or bytes_deposit are later reduced via set_*_deposit() methods, can total_deposit() become less than originally paid, allowing storage cost refund exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: new()] [Deposit validation] Does new() validate that slot_deposit and bytes_deposit match the actual size() of the StateValue data, or can attackers claim tiny deposits for huge data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: bytes_deposit()] [Bytes accounting] Is bytes_deposit() correctly calculated based on actual Bytes length, and can attackers exploit compression or encoding tricks to store more data than their deposit covers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: placeholder()] [Zero deposit exploit] Can attackers abuse placeholder() to create StateValues with zero deposits that never get pruned, causing permanent storage bloat without economic cost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: legacy()] [Legacy deposit tracking] Does legacy() with bytes_deposit=0 allow old state values to avoid paying for storage bytes, creating economic imbalance between V0 and V1 storage costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: none()] [Missing metadata] Can StateValues created with StateValueMetadata::none() bypass deposit requirements entirely, allowing free storage that violates economic security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: metadata_mut()] [Concurrent mutation] Can multiple threads obtain mutable references to StateValue metadata via metadata_mut() and race to modify deposits, causing lost updates or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: set_bytes()] [Data race] If set_bytes() is called concurrently with bytes() or size() from different threads, can this cause data races on the Bytes field despite Rust's borrow checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: maybe_upgrade()] [TOCTOU] Between checking metadata state and upgrading it via maybe_upgrade(), can another thread modify metadata, causing time-of-check-time-of-use race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: unpack()] [Move semantics] Does unpack() properly consume self by move, and can incorrect usage patterns lead to use-after-move or double-free issues with the underlying Bytes data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: expect_upgraded()] [Error handling] Does expect_upgraded() provide meaningful error context when panicking, or can silent panics during deserialization hide the root cause of state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: creation_time_usecs()] [Zero timestamp] Can creation_time_usecs() return 0 for None metadata, and does this cause issues in time-based logic that assumes non-zero timestamps for all state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: map_bytes()] [Error propagation] If the transformation function F returns Err in map_bytes(), is the error properly propagated, or can error swallowing hide data corruption during state migrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: inner()] [Option handling] Does inner() returning Option require all callers to properly handle None cases, or can unwrap() calls elsewhere cause panics when metadata is unexpectedly absent? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: is_none()] [State validation] Can is_none() metadata exist alongside non-empty data in StateValue, creating semantically invalid states that break invariants expected by Move VM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: new_legacy()] [Legacy compatibility] Can new_legacy() be misused to create StateValues that bypass current deposit requirements by using deprecated metadata-free format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Impl: From<Vec<u8>>] [Conversion safety] Does From<Vec<u8>> implementation properly handle empty vectors, maximum-size vectors, and vectors with invalid UTF-8, or can these cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Impl: From<Bytes>] [Conditional compilation] Why is From<Bytes> only available in test/fuzzing builds, and can production code accidentally create invalid StateValue instances without this conversion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: into_bytes()] [Metadata loss] Does into_bytes() discard metadata permanently, and can this lead to loss of deposit information if StateValue is reconstructed from bytes alone? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: into_metadata()] [Data loss] Does into_metadata() discard data permanently, and can this cause issues if metadata is persisted separately from data without maintaining referential integrity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Derive: CryptoHasher] [Hash domain separation] Does CryptoHasher derivation for StateValue provide domain separation from other hash uses, preventing cross-protocol hash collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: compute_rapid_hash()] [Non-cryptographic hash] Is rapidhash() suitable for security-critical equality checks, or should a cryptographic hash be used to prevent intentional collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Constant: RAPID_HASH_THRESHOLD] [Threshold selection] Is RAPID_HASH_THRESHOLD=32 bytes chosen based on security analysis, or is it arbitrary and potentially exploitable for bypassing hash-based security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Function: eq()] [Timing attack] Does the fast-path rapid_hash comparison at line 192-196 leak timing information about data similarity that could be exploited in side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_value.rs] [Struct: StateValue] [Deterministic hashing] Is rapid hash computation deterministic across different validator platforms (x86/ARM, little/big endian), ensuring all validators compute identical maybe_rapid_hash values? (Critical)"
