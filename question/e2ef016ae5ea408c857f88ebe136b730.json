  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions()] [Integer Underflow] In the retry loop at lines 47-48, can an attacker cause checked_sub() to return None by manipulating elapsed time, causing the function to bail after limited retries and potentially causing loss of liveness during critical transaction emission periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions()] [Infinite Loop DoS] Does the retry loop starting at line 43 have proper bounds checking, or can it run indefinitely if Cluster::try_from_cluster_args() consistently fails, exhausting resources and causing validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to emit_transactions() with coordination_delay_between_instances create race conditions where multiple instances compute different remaining delays at line 47, leading to inconsistent transaction emission timing and potential mempool flooding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions()] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate system time to cause start_time.elapsed() at line 47 to return unexpected values, bypassing coordination delays and causing transaction storms that overwhelm the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions()] [Logic Error] At line 48, if coordination_delay_between_instances becomes None and i has reached a large value, does the bail! message at line 49 leak sensitive information about retry attempts that could help attackers time their attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Gas Price Bypass] At lines 137-139, can an attacker provide arbitrarily low gas_price values through args.gas_price to create transactions that validators will reject, causing wasted computation and potential DoS on the mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Integer Overflow] Can args.max_gas_per_txn at lines 141-143 be set to values exceeding u64::MAX or blockchain gas limits, causing integer overflow in gas calculations and potential transaction rejection after expensive computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Gas Calculation Bypass] At lines 145-147, can init_max_gas_per_txn be set higher than max_gas_per_txn, creating inconsistent gas limits that allow transactions to bypass gas restrictions during initialization phase? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Economic Attack] Can init_gas_price_multiplier at lines 149-151 be set to extreme values (e.g., 1000000x) to make initial account creation transactions economically infeasible, preventing legitimate users from creating accounts while draining the coin_source_account? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Inconsistent Gas Estimation] Between lines 153-165, if multiple expected_gas_* parameters are set with conflicting values (e.g., expected_gas_per_txn < expected_gas_per_transfer), can this cause incorrect balance calculations leading to insufficient funding and transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Authentication Bypass] At lines 109-130, when keyless authentication is used, are the expect() calls at lines 116, 122, 128 safe, or can an attacker provide a keyless_ephem_secret_key without setting other required fields, causing panics that crash the transaction emitter? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Keyless Account Impersonation] Does the keyless account setup at lines 109-130 properly validate the JWT signature and expiry date, or can an attacker use expired or forged JWTs to create unauthorized keyless accounts and drain funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Proof File Manipulation] At lines 118-123, can an attacker provide a malicious proof_file_path pointing to a tampered proof file that passes validation but allows unauthorized account creation or transaction signing?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Unauthorized Spending] At line 170, does prompt_before_spending() actually prevent spending, or is it just a UI prompt that can be bypassed by automated scripts to drain non-root coin sources without user consent? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Balance Override Bypass] At lines 177-179, can coins_per_account_override be set to 0 to skip funding checks while still creating accounts, leading to unfunded accounts that cannot perform transactions but pollute the state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter-lib/src/wrappers.rs] [Function: emit_transactions_with_cluster()] [Funding Skip Exploit] At lines 186-188, when skip_funding_accounts is true, are accounts still created but unfunded, allowing an attacker to create millions of empty accounts that bloat the blockchain state without paying appropriate costs?
