  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Testing] Does the test suite cover error handling paths comprehensively enough to detect Byzantine error injection attacks, or are error paths undertested compared to happy paths? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Label Stability] Are error labels considered stable API, or could label changes break monitoring dashboards during security incidents, hindering incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Async Cancellation] When peer monitoring tasks are cancelled, are errors properly propagated or silently dropped, potentially hiding Byzantine behavior detected during cancelled operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Codes] Does the absence of numeric error codes make it difficult to create compact error telemetry or efficiently track error trends across the network? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Retryability] Can error handlers determine which errors are retryable versus fatal, or could incorrect retry logic amplify Byzantine attacks by repeatedly processing malicious peer responses? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Trait: From] [Conversion Overhead] Does error conversion using to_string() introduce performance overhead in hot error paths that could be exploited to degrade validator performance during attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Context for Auditing] Do errors carry sufficient metadata (peer ID, timestamp, request type) for security auditing, or is contextual information lost during error propagation? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Function: From<UnexpectedResponseError>] [Response Validation] Before converting UnexpectedResponseError, is there validation that the unexpected response doesn't contain malicious payloads or exploit deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error-Based Timing Attacks] Can measuring the time difference between different error types reveal information about internal node state or network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Backward Compatibility] If new error variants are added in protocol upgrades, will older nodes gracefully handle unknown errors or crash, potentially causing network splits? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Injection in Integration] When peer monitoring integrates with consensus or state sync components, can errors be injected at integration boundaries to bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Metrics Cardinality] Do error labels have bounded cardinality, or could dynamic error content cause cardinality explosion in monitoring systems leading to metric store exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Handling Consistency] Are errors handled consistently across sync and async code paths, or could inconsistent error handling create exploitable edge cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Trait: From] [Generic Error Conversion] Does the generic nature of From trait conversions prevent compile-time verification of error handling completeness, potentially missing security-critical error cases? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error Correlation with Network Events] Can errors be correlated with network-level events (peer connections, disconnections) to detect coordinated Byzantine attacks across multiple peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Mutability] Are Error instances immutable after creation, or could error state be modified in flight causing inconsistent error reporting? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Graceful Degradation] When peer monitoring errors accumulate, does the system gracefully degrade (use cached peer info) or catastrophically fail (disconnect all peers)? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Function: From implementations] [Error Type Explosion] Could the error conversion graph (network error -> application error -> monitoring error) grow complex enough to create security gaps in error handling logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Error-Driven State Machines] If peer monitoring uses error states to drive peer health state machines, can Byzantine peers manipulate error sequences to achieve invalid state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Serialization Security] If errors are ever serialized (for logging, metrics, RPC), are String fields properly escaped to prevent injection attacks in downstream log processing systems? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Type: Error] [Resource Cleanup on Error] When errors occur, are network resources (sockets, connections) properly cleaned up, or can error handling paths leak resources enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/error.rs] [Function: get_label()] [Error Label Injection] Could error messages from Byzantine peers contain characters that when passed through get_label() break metric label parsing or injection vulnerabilities in monitoring systems? (Low)"
