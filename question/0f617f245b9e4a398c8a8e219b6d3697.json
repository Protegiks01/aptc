  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Closure capture] The closure at lines 82-147 captures self by mutable reference - does this create any memory safety issues or prevent optimizations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: new()] [Callback storage] Line 46 stores a closure of type F - can large callbacks or closures with many captures cause excessive memory usage in the checker? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Purity definition] Lines 4-17 define purity rules - are these rules complete and sufficient to guarantee no side effects, or can attackers find edge cases that satisfy the rules but still cause observable side effects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Side effect coverage] The checker looks for borrow_global_mut, &mut, Mutate, and impure function calls - are there other side effect mechanisms (events, logging, gas consumption patterns) that could be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Transitive purity] Lines 122-142 implement transitive purity checking - if function A calls B calls C and C is impure, does the checker correctly propagate impurity through the entire chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [DFS completeness] Line 18 mentions DFS search - does this algorithm guarantee that all paths through the call graph are explored, or can circular dependencies cause some paths to be skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Specification semantics] Lines 11-16 define additional specification mode rules - are these rules consistent with the formal verification requirements, or can they incorrectly reject valid specifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_spec()] [SpecBlock creation] Lines 155-156 create synthetic ExpData::SpecBlock - does this properly preserve all semantic information from the original spec, or can important details be lost in translation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [GlobalEnv dependency] The checker receives GlobalEnv at line 79 - if GlobalEnv is modified or becomes inconsistent during checking, can this cause incorrect pureness results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Function retrieval] Line 160 calls env.get_function(qid) - can this return stale or incorrect function data if the environment is updated concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: into_map()] [Result consumption] Line 75 returns the pureness map by value - if the caller doesn't properly use this map, can incorrect pureness information propagate to other parts of the system? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: new()] [Mode selection] Lines 62-70 allow arbitrary mode selection - can attackers exploit this by using General mode where Specification mode should be required, bypassing stricter checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Empty expressions] Does the checker properly handle empty expressions or expressions with no operations - can these be exploited to bypass pureness checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Parameter iteration] Lines 169-172 iterate over function parameters - can malformed parameter lists cause panics or incorrect results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Return type iteration] Lines 173-176 iterate over return types after flatten() - can complex or recursive return types cause infinite loops in type traversal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Assign in general mode] Line 86 only checks Assign in Specification mode - should assignments also be considered impure in General mode for consistency? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Return without flag set] Lines 94-100 check Return in Specification mode but don't set is_impure=true - is this intentional, or can it lead to inconsistent behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Block with None] Line 101 checks Block(id, _, None, _) - does this correctly identify all uninitialized let bindings, or can attackers use Some(expr) with no-op expressions to bypass the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Default case handling] Line 143 has an empty default case - should this log warnings or take other actions when unknown expression types are encountered? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [NodeId usage] Multiple NodeIds are passed to callbacks - are these IDs properly validated before use, or can invalid IDs cause crashes or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_function()] [Cycle optimization] Line 163 inserts 'true' optimistically to break cycles - can attackers exploit this by creating mutually recursive functions where the optimistic assumption becomes permanent? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Early termination optimization] Line 146 stops traversal when impurity is found - can this optimization cause the checker to miss additional impurity patterns that should be reported? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Function: check_exp()] [Cache lookup] Line 126 checks contains_key before recursive analysis - if the cache is corrupted, can this prevent necessary re-checking of functions? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/pureness_checker.rs] [Overall] [Verification soundness] If the pureness checker incorrectly marks an impure function as pure, can this lead to unsound formal verification results where proofs assume no side effects but side effects actually occur?
