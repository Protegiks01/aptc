  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Protocol consistency] Is the same protocol_id used for all recipients, and can this be exploited if different peers expect different protocol versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Atomicity violation] Since sends are sequential and fail-fast, can partial delivery states be observed by the network, violating consensus atomicity requirements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Clone cost] For large messages, cloning Message for each peer could be expensive - can this be exploited to cause CPU exhaustion during critical consensus periods? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout bypass] Can an attacker set an extremely long timeout value to cause RPC requests to hold resources indefinitely, exhausting validator connection pools and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout overflow] Is the Duration timeout validated for reasonable bounds, or can integer overflow in timeout calculations cause immediate timeouts or infinite waits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Channel race] Between push() and res_rx.await, can the channel be closed causing res_rx to hang forever even though push() succeeded, leading to deadlocked consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response spoofing] Can a malicious peer send a response that doesn't match the request, and does the oneshot channel ensure response authenticity, or could this enable consensus manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Request size] Does send_rpc() limit the size of the req Bytes to prevent memory exhaustion when many concurrent RPCs are in flight? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response size] Is there validation on the size of the response Bytes to prevent a malicious peer from sending gigantic responses that crash the requestor? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Oneshot channel drop] If res_tx is dropped before sending a response, does res_rx.await properly handle the error, or does it deadlock waiting for a response that will never come? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Concurrent RPC limit] Can an attacker issue unlimited concurrent RPCs to the same peer to exhaust resources, and is there a per-peer concurrency limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout precision] Does the timeout enforcement happen client-side or server-side, and can clock skew between peers cause timeout inconsistencies affecting consensus timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Error propagation] RpcError is returned from res_rx.await - can this lose critical information about why the RPC failed (network issue vs Byzantine peer), affecting peer reputation tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Protocol mismatch] Can protocol_id mismatch between request and response cause type confusion vulnerabilities when deserializing the response? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Async cancellation] If send_rpc() future is dropped/cancelled before completion, is the oneshot channel properly cleaned up to prevent resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Duplicate response] Can a malicious peer send multiple responses through the oneshot channel, and does the channel prevent this to avoid response confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [PeerId consistency] Is there validation that the peer_id in the request matches the actual responding peer to prevent response hijacking attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Zero timeout] What happens if timeout is Duration::ZERO - does it fail immediately or cause undefined behavior that could be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/senders.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response ordering] For multiple concurrent RPCs to the same peer, does response ordering matter, and can reordering cause state machine violations in consensus? (High)",
