  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: fake_id()] [Block Reconstruction] The fake_id() reconstructs BlockData at lines 90-97. Are all fields copied correctly? Could missing fields (validator_txns, metadata) cause validation failures or enable attacks through incomplete block reconstruction? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Block::new_proposal Call] The Block::new_proposal at lines 45-51 is called with specific parameters. Are parameter validation rules consistent between test and production? Could test blocks bypass validation checks present in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Signer Reuse] The signer parameter is used to sign proposals. Could the same signer be used for multiple conflicting blocks, enabling equivocation? Does test code properly detect when signers produce conflicting signatures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: child()] [Key Pool Distribution] The child() uses mostly_in_keypair_pool at line 165. Could non-uniform key selection bias test coverage, missing bugs that only manifest with certain validator identities or key patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: child()] [Parent Index Bounds] At line 133, parent_idx is selected from 0..len. Could selecting index 0 (genesis) as parent for all blocks create unrealistic test scenarios where consensus bugs in deep chains are missed? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: child()] [QC-Parent Gap] The QC can reference any block from 0..=parent_idx. Could large gaps between QC block and parent enable attacks where blocks reference very old QCs, bypassing timeout logic or liveness checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: unmoored_block()] [Arbitrary Ancestor] The unmoored block references arbitrary ancestor_id at line 70. Could this create blocks claiming ancestry from blocks in different epochs, forks, or chains, enabling cross-chain attacks or fork confusion? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: random_payload()] [Transaction Realism] Test transactions at lines 265-267 use sequential nonces. Do real transactions follow this pattern? Could unrealistic test data hide bugs in nonce gap handling, out-of-order execution, or transaction conflict detection? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: new_proposal()] [Empty Payload Testing] All test blocks use empty payloads. Could this hide bugs in gas accounting, transaction validation, or execution that only manifest with real transaction payloads? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: gen_test_certificate()] [Signature Aggregation] The function uses generate_ledger_info_with_sig at line 206. Does this properly aggregate BLS signatures? Could test signature aggregation differ from production, hiding bugs in aggregate signature verification or threshold validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: block_forest_from_keys()] [Expected Branch Size] The comment at line 161 mentions expected_branch_size of 1 generates larger trees. Could this unexpected behavior hide tree topology bugs that only manifest with specific branching patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Function: certificate_for_genesis()] [Genesis From LedgerInfo] At line 256, genesis block is created from ledger info. Could inconsistencies between LedgerInfo and Block genesis creation enable validators to disagree on genesis state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Module: Type Aliases] [LinearizedBlockForest Type] At line 28, LinearizedBlockForest is defined as Vec<Block>. Could the linear representation hide bugs in DAG-based block handling, missing issues with concurrent branches or forks? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Module: Imports] [CryptoHash Usage] At line 16, CryptoHash is imported. Are all hash operations properly using cryptographic hashes? Could accidental use of non-cryptographic hashes in tests hide real hash collision vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/block_test_utils.rs] [Module: Dependencies] [Test Helper Dependencies] At line 23, test_helpers are imported. Could test helper code have vulnerabilities that leak into production, or could production code accidentally depend on test helpers? (Medium)"
