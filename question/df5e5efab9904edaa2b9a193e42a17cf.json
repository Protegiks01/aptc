  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: release_group_cache()] [Unreachable Panic] The function contains unreachable!() with a comment about RespawnedSession - if this assumption is violated and the function is called, can it cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: release_group_cache()] [Invariant Assumption] What guarantees that this function is never called? If the calling code changes or has bugs, can accidental calls cause deterministic panics across all validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: is_resource_groups_split_in_change_set_capable()] [Capability Mismatch] The function delegates to base_resource_group_view - if the change set has different capabilities than the base view, can this cause feature detection to be incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: is_resource_groups_split_in_change_set_capable()] [Feature Flag Confusion] If this capability check returns different values across validators due to version mismatches, can it cause consensus divergence when handling split resource groups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: id()] [Identity Confusion] The function returns base_executor_view.id() - if multiple ExecutorViewWithChangeSet instances share the same base view, will they report the same ID causing caching or tracking issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: id()] [Change Set Ignored] The StateViewId doesn't account for the change set contents - can this cause two views with the same base but different change sets to be incorrectly considered identical? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: read_state_value()] [Read Recording] The function delegates to base_executor_view for read recording - are reads from the change set also recorded, or can missing read records cause incorrect dependency tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/view_with_change_set.rs] [Function: read_state_value()] [Change Set Bypass] Since this only records reads in base view, can an attacker query resources entirely from the change set without triggering read recording, bypassing access logs? (Low)"
