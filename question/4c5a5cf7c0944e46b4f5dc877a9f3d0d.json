  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::new()] [Information Disclosure] Can sensitive validator private keys, seed phrases, or cryptographic material be inadvertently passed through the message or keys_and_values parameters and logged to disk, potentially exposing them to attackers with filesystem access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::dispatch()] [Information Disclosure] Does the dispatch mechanism perform any sanitization of sensitive blockchain data (validator IP addresses, stake amounts, governance votes) before logging, or can internal network topology and validator identities be exposed through logs?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Struct: Event] [Information Disclosure] Can consensus voting decisions, block proposals, or validator peer discovery information be logged in plaintext, allowing an attacker to analyze validator behavior and plan targeted attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::new()] [Log Injection] Can malicious transaction payloads containing newline characters or ANSI escape sequences be passed through message parameters to inject false log entries or manipulate log parsing tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::dispatch()] [Log Injection] Does the dispatch method validate or sanitize the fmt::Arguments before logging, or can attackers inject malicious format strings to cause format string vulnerabilities in downstream log processors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: KeysAndValues::fmt()] [Log Injection] Can the debug_map visitor be exploited with specially crafted Schema implementations that inject control characters, allowing log tampering to hide malicious validator activity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Struct: Event] [Log Injection] If an attacker submits transactions with crafted string fields, can they inject fake error messages or consensus failure logs to trigger false alerts or hide real attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::dispatch()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker flood the network with transactions designed to trigger excessive logging events, causing disk space exhaustion on validator nodes and potentially causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any limit on the size of keys_and_values slice, or can malicious code create Event objects with thousands of Schema entries causing memory exhaustion during logging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: KeysAndValues::fmt()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can extremely large or deeply nested Schema objects cause stack overflow or excessive CPU usage during debug formatting, degrading validator performance during critical consensus rounds?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::message()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can fmt::Arguments containing extremely long format strings or recursive formatters cause unbounded memory allocation when processed by the logging system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::dispatch()] [Race Condition] Does the dispatch call to crate::logger::dispatch() handle concurrent Event submissions from multiple threads safely, or can race conditions cause log entries to be interleaved or corrupted during high transaction throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Struct: Event] [Race Condition] Since Event contains lifetime-bound references ('a), can there be use-after-free issues if the metadata or keys_and_values data is freed while an Event is still being processed by the logger in another thread? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::keys_and_values()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent access to the Schema trait objects through the dyn Schema slice lead to data races if the Schema implementations are not thread-safe? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Struct: Event] [Memory Safety] The Event struct stores lifetime-bound references - can these references become dangling if the underlying data (Metadata, fmt::Arguments, Schema slice) is dropped while an Event is still being processed?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Function: Event::new()] [Memory Safety] Does the constructor properly validate that the metadata and keys_and_values references remain valid for the entire 'a lifetime, or can this lead to undefined behavior during logging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-logger/src/event.rs] [Struct: KeysAndValues] [Memory Safety] The KeysAndValues struct wraps a slice of trait objects - can improper lifetime management lead to accessing freed Schema objects during the fmt() call? (High)",
