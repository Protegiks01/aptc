  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Gas Metering Time Dependency] If gas metering or execution time limits use duration_since_epoch(), can time manipulation allow validators to execute transactions with insufficient gas or exceed execution time limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Mempool Timestamp Validation] If mempool uses duration_since_epoch() to reject transactions with impossible timestamps, can time manipulation cause valid transactions to be rejected or invalid ones to be accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [State Sync Timing] If state sync protocols use duration_since_epoch() to measure sync progress or timeout stalled connections, can time manipulation disrupt state sync and prevent nodes from catching up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [API Layer Timestamp] If REST API responses include timestamps from duration_since_epoch(), can inconsistent timestamps across different API calls confuse clients or break API-based monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Non-Deterministic Execution] Since duration_since_epoch() returns the current time (inherently non-deterministic), how does Aptos ensure deterministic state transitions when this function is called during transaction execution? (Critical Analysis)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Block Timestamp Source] Should block timestamps come from duration_since_epoch() at proposal time, or should they be derived from the proposer's submitted value with validation, to ensure deterministic execution? (Architecture)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Move VM Time Access] If Move smart contracts can access blockchain time, should they use duration_since_epoch() directly (non-deterministic) or must they use block timestamps (deterministic) to maintain state machine guarantees? (Critical Architecture)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Panic Recovery] When expect() panics due to pre-UNIX_EPOCH time, is there any panic recovery mechanism in the consensus layer, or does the entire validator process crash requiring manual restart? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch_at()] [Error Propagation] Should duration_since_epoch_at() return Result<Duration, Error> instead of panicking via expect(), allowing callers to handle time errors gracefully without crashing? (Architecture)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Graceful Degradation] If system time becomes unreliable or backwards-moving, can the validator enter a safe mode that relies on relative time measurements instead of absolute timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Trust Boundary Violation] Does duration_since_epoch() cross trust boundaries where untrusted system time from potentially compromised OS is used in trusted consensus logic without additional validation? (Medium Analysis)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch_at()] [Privilege Escalation] Can low-privilege code paths call duration_since_epoch_at() with attacker-controlled SystemTime values to influence high-privilege consensus decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Daylight Saving Time] Although Duration is DST-agnostic, can DST transitions (where clocks jump forward/backward by an hour) cause temporary inconsistencies in validators across different geographic regions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [Clock Resolution] What is the actual resolution/granularity of duration_since_epoch() on different platforms (nanoseconds on Linux, milliseconds on Windows), and can platform-specific differences cause consensus inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch()] [System Hibernation/Sleep] If a validator's system hibernates or sleeps for extended periods, can duration_since_epoch() return stale or discontinuous values upon wake, causing consensus disruptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/time.rs] [Function: duration_since_epoch_at()] [Future Time Limits] Is there any validation that system_time parameter is not unreasonably far in the future (e.g., year 3000), or can callers create Duration values that cause integer overflows in subsequent calculations?
