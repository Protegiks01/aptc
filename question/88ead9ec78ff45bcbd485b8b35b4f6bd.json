(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: bcs::from_bytes().ok()?] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide a TransactionPayload with incorrect BCS-encoded types that deserialize successfully but cause type confusion, leading to funds being sent to wrong addresses or incorrect operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: decode()] [Deserialization bypass] Does the decode() function properly validate that the deserialized EntryFunctionCall variant matches the actual module and function name, or can attackers craft payloads that decode to the wrong EntryFunctionCall variant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: script.args().get()] [Out of bounds] Can a malicious TransactionPayload with fewer arguments than expected cause the decoder functions to return None silently, potentially allowing malformed transactions to pass validation?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_rotate_authentication_key_call()] [Unverified rotation] Since this function accepts new_auth_key without proof-of-knowledge, can an attacker rotate their authentication key to a malicious value and then use set_originating_address() to poison the OriginatingAddress table? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_offer_rotation_capability()] [Recipient override] When offering rotation capability, can an attacker repeatedly call this function to update recipient_address to themselves just before the original recipient accepts, hijacking the rotation capability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_offer_signer_capability()] [Capability hijacking] Can an attacker monitor pending signer capability offers and front-run the acceptance by offering to a different recipient_address, potentially stealing full control of the account? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_revoke_rotation_capability()] [Wrong revocation] Does the function validate that to_be_revoked_address actually has a pending rotation capability offer, or can it fail silently allowing the capability to persist? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_revoke_any_rotation_capability()] [Revocation bypass] Can an attacker who previously obtained rotation capability use it before the revocation transaction is processed, creating a race condition for account takeover?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/cached-packages/src/aptos_framework_sdk_builder.rs] [Function: account_abstraction_remove_authentication_function()] [Incomplete removal] Can an attacker prevent removal of a malicious authentication function by crafting BCS-encoded module_name or function_name that don't match the stored values due to encoding differences?
