  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Output completeness] Does Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> guarantee that outputs for all input transactions are present, or can shards skip failed transactions leading to output/input count mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Nested vector semantics] What does the outer Vec in Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> represent (rounds? sub-blocks?), and can confusion about semantics cause incorrect result aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Output determinism] Are TransactionOutputs guaranteed to be deterministic across different shard implementations, or can implementation differences cause output divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Silent failures] Does the trait provide any mechanism to detect when implementations are silently failing (e.g., hanging on receive, dropping sends), or are failures only detected by timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [Performance degradation] Can slowly-responding implementations cause coordinator timeout without any error indication, making it difficult to diagnose performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [ExecutorShardCommand] [BCS round-trip] When commands are serialized for remote execution, can BCS deserialization produce subtly different objects (e.g., different Arc pointer values) causing functional differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: send_execution_result] [Large result serialization] Can extremely large Vec<Vec<TransactionOutput>> (e.g., from blocks with many transactions) cause BCS serialization to fail or timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Trait: CoordinatorClient] [ABA problem] Can Arc reference counting in ExecutorShardCommand create ABA problems where StateView is freed and reallocated at the same address causing use-after-free bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/coordinator_client.rs] [Method: receive_execute_command] [Thundering herd] If multiple worker threads call receive_execute_command() concurrently, can they create a thundering herd competing for channel access causing performance degradation? (Low)"
