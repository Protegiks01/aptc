  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Root hash tampering] Can an attacker supply a state_summary with a malicious global_state_summary.root_hash() that doesn't correspond to the actual state after transactions, bypassing state integrity checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Sparse Merkle Tree inconsistency] If the state_summary contains a SparseMerkleTree that is not properly frozen or updated with the execution results, can this lead to incorrect state root hashes being committed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Version rollback] Can an attacker create a StateCheckpointOutput with a state_summary that has a next_version() lower than the parent's version, allowing them to roll back state and potentially double-spend? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new_dummy()] [Test code in production] If new_dummy() is accidentally used in production code instead of tests, can this create a StateCheckpointOutput with empty state that breaks consensus when validators try to verify it? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Empty hash vector] When new_empty() creates a StateCheckpointOutput with an empty state_checkpoint_hashes vector, can consuming code incorrectly assume there are hashes present and attempt to index into an empty vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new_dummy()] [Consensus bypass] Can a malicious validator send a StateCheckpointOutput created with new_dummy() that has an empty LedgerStateSummary, causing other validators to accept blocks without proper state verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new_empty()] [Parent state trust] Does new_empty() validate that parent_state_summary is from a committed block, or can it accept state from speculative execution on a forked branch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Known hashes bypass] In DoStateCheckpoint::run, when known_state_checkpoints is provided, the validation only checks that known[idx] matches computed hash. Can an attacker supply malicious known hashes for non-checkpoint indices to bypass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Checkpoint index calculation] If DoStateCheckpoint calculates last_checkpoint_index incorrectly and passes a state_checkpoint_hashes vector where the checkpoint hash is at the wrong index, can this cause state verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [State update application] If state_summary is created by applying updates with parent_state_summary.update() but the updates contain malicious state changes, can the resulting StateCheckpointOutput commit invalid state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Multiple checkpoints] When execution output contains multiple checkpoints (e.g., multiple blocks or reconfiguration transactions), does the state_checkpoint_hashes vector correctly represent all checkpoint positions, or can some be missed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [TransactionInfo assembly] In DoLedgerUpdate::assemble_transaction_infos, state_checkpoint_hashes[i] is directly used to create TransactionInfo. Can an out-of-bounds access occur if the vector length is incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Hash extraction] When state_checkpoint_hashes is cloned in DoLedgerUpdate::run, can the clone operation fail or result in a different vector, causing inconsistencies in TransactionInfo creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [None vs Some logic] If state_checkpoint_hashes contains None for a transaction that executed successfully, can this cause the TransactionInfo to be created without a state checkpoint hash when one is required for verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Parallel assembly] DoLedgerUpdate uses parallel iteration to assemble TransactionInfo objects. Can race conditions when accessing state_checkpoint_hashes lead to incorrect hash assignments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: StateCheckpointOutput] [Large state accumulation] Can an attacker force creation of many StateCheckpointOutput instances with large state_checkpoint_hashes vectors, consuming excessive memory before DropHelper schedules async deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [LedgerStateSummary size] If state_summary contains very large SparseMerkleTree data structures, can creating multiple StateCheckpointOutput instances exhaust available memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [DropHelper queue] If DropHelper's async drop queue is full (32 max tasks as per DEFAULT_DROPPER), can newly created StateCheckpointOutput instances block waiting for queue space, causing execution delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new_impl()] [Arc leak] If Arc<DropHelper<Inner>> references are leaked (e.g., stored in a global cache and never released), can this prevent memory cleanup indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: StateCheckpointOutput] [StateComputeResult inclusion] When StateCheckpointOutput is included in StateComputeResult sent to consensus, can a malicious validator modify the state_checkpoint_hashes before other validators verify it? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Determinism] If two validators execute the same transactions but create StateCheckpointOutput with different state_checkpoint_hashes (e.g., due to race conditions), can this cause consensus to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Struct: Inner] [Block tree fork] If StateCheckpointOutput from a forked branch is used to create StateComputeResult, can this cause validators to commit state from an invalid fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/state_checkpoint_output.rs] [Function: reconfig_suffix()] [Epoch state fork] If multiple validators create different reconfig_suffix() outputs during an epoch transition, can this cause a permanent fork in the validator set? (Critical)",
