  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/builtins.rs] [Function: move_to() duplicate resource] [Resource uniqueness] Can move_to() be called multiple times to publish duplicate resources at the same address, violating Move's resource uniqueness invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/builtins.rs] [Function: move_from() builtin] [Resource extraction] Can move_from() at lines 928-938 be exploited to extract resources from addresses without proper authorization, enabling resource theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/builtins.rs] [Function: move_from() missing resource] [Error handling] Does move_from() handle the case where the resource doesn't exist at the address gracefully, or can it cause panics that halt execution? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/builtins.rs] [Function: old() builtin] [Temporal logic] Can the old() function at lines 967-978 be nested or used in invalid contexts to cause confusion about which historical state is being referenced in specifications? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/builtins.rs] [Function: old() state capture] [State consistency] Does old() properly capture state at function entry, or can concurrent modifications or reentrancy cause it to reference inconsistent or partially updated state? (High)",
