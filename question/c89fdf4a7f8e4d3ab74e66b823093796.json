  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Header manipulation] Can an attacker send a POST request with a small Content-Length header value that passes validation but then send a much larger payload body, bypassing size limits and causing memory exhaustion on validator API nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Header forgery] Can an attacker send multiple Content-Length headers with conflicting values to exploit HTTP request smuggling, where one header passes validation but the actual body size processed is different? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Missing header] Does the error handling for missing Content-Length header properly prevent request processing, or can attackers send POST requests without Content-Length to bypass size validation entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Header type confusion] Can an attacker send a Content-Length header with non-numeric characters, special values (like 'infinity'), or scientific notation that gets parsed incorrectly, bypassing the size check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Negative values] Does the typed_get method properly reject negative Content-Length values, or can attackers use negative numbers that get converted to large u64 values after type casting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimit::new()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker cause the API to accept arbitrarily large requests if max_size is set to u64::MAX during initialization, potentially causing integer overflow in downstream processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Boundary condition] Does the comparison content_length.0 > self.max_size handle the edge case where content_length equals max_size correctly, or can attackers send requests exactly at the boundary that should be rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [u64 wraparound] If Content-Length is set to a value just below u64::MAX, can this cause integer overflow when the actual body processing adds metadata or processing overhead? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimit::new()] [Zero size limit] What happens if max_size is configured as 0? Does this properly reject all POST requests, or can a zero-byte payload bypass validation due to off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Method bypass] Can an attacker bypass size validation by using alternative HTTP methods (PUT, PATCH) that modify state but aren't checked, potentially sending oversized payloads for transaction submission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Method override] Can attackers use X-HTTP-Method-Override header to send a GET request that gets internally treated as POST, bypassing the method check while still processing large payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Case sensitivity] Is the method comparison case-sensitive? Can attackers send 'post', 'Post', or 'POST' to exploit case-handling inconsistencies in the framework? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Struct: PostSizeLimit] [Middleware ordering] If PostSizeLimit is applied after body-reading middleware in the chain, does it still prevent oversized payloads from being fully read into memory, or is the check performed too late? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Struct: PostSizeLimit] [Middleware bypass] Can attackers craft requests that skip the middleware chain entirely through API endpoint configuration errors, allowing unlimited-size transaction submissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimit::transform()] [Middleware composition] If multiple PostSizeLimit middlewares are chained with different max_size values, which one takes precedence, and can this lead to inconsistent validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Async race condition] Can concurrent POST requests to the same endpoint cause race conditions in the async call method, where size validation passes for one request but payload processing occurs for a different oversized request? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Async cancellation] If the async call is cancelled after size validation passes but before self.inner.call() executes, can this leave the system in an inconsistent state with partially validated requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Timeout handling] Does the middleware properly handle request timeouts? Can an attacker send a valid Content-Length header but then slowly trickle data to bypass timeout protections while keeping the connection alive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Error information leak] Does the SizedLimitError::PayloadTooLarge error response leak sensitive information about the configured max_size that could help attackers probe system limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Error handling path] Can an attacker trigger the MissingContentLength error repeatedly to cause resource exhaustion through error logging or metrics collection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Panic conditions] Are there any unwrap() or expect() calls in the poem framework's typed_get that could cause panics and crash the API server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Transaction flooding] Can an attacker submit transactions just under the size limit repeatedly to flood the mempool or exhaust validator resources, even though each individual request passes validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Batched transactions] If the API supports batched transaction submission, does the size limit apply per transaction or per batch? Can attackers send many small transactions in a single large batch to bypass limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Compressed payloads] If POST requests use Content-Encoding (gzip, deflate), does the size check validate the compressed or decompressed size? Can attackers send small compressed payloads that decompress to huge sizes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Struct: PostSizeLimitEndpoint] [Shared state] Is the max_size value shared across all concurrent requests safely? Could race conditions in reading max_size lead to inconsistent validation? (Low)"
