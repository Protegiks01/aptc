  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Resource Exhaustion] Does deserialization have depth/complexity limits, or can deeply nested or recursive policy structures cause stack overflow or excessive memory allocation during validator startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Format Confusion] Are policies serialized in multiple formats (JSON, BCS, TOML) with format-specific vulnerabilities, and can attackers exploit format confusion to bypass validation present in one format but not another? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Enforcement Gap] Where is policy enforcement actually implemented, and are there any storage backend implementations that fail to enforce policies, allowing direct access bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Default Policy] What is the default policy when none is specified, and can this default be more permissive than intended, accidentally exposing validator keys in fresh installations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Policy Update Race] Can policies be updated while operations are in flight, and can race conditions between policy updates and access checks lead to TOCTOU vulnerabilities where access is granted under old policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Namespace Isolation] Do policies properly enforce namespace isolation in multi-tenant scenarios, or can attackers craft policies that grant cross-namespace access to other validators' private keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Policy Caching] Are policies cached, and if so, can stale policy caches allow continued access after permissions have been revoked, enabling compromised services to maintain unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Backend Translation] How are policy identities mapped to backend authentication tokens, and can this translation be exploited to gain access to other identities' permissions through token manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Capability Aggregation] If multiple Permission entries match an Identity, are capabilities unioned or intersected, and can attackers exploit unexpected aggregation logic to gain unintended capability combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Policy Enforcement] [Error Handling] When policy checks fail, are errors safely handled without information leakage, or can attackers use timing side-channels or error messages to enumerate valid identities and capabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty Policy] What happens when a Policy has zero permissions - is access denied to everyone including administrators, potentially locking out legitimate access to critical validator keys during emergencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Conflicting Permissions] If a Policy has both Identity::Anyone with Read and Identity::NoOne, which takes precedence, and can attackers exploit ambiguous precedence rules to bypass intended access restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Self-Conflicting Capabilities] Can a single Permission contain conflicting capabilities (e.g., both Rotate and preventing rotation), and if so, how are conflicts resolved - in favor of more or less restrictive interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode Edge Cases] How are Unicode strings in Identity::User handled, and can attackers exploit normalization differences, right-to-left override characters, or homograph attacks to spoof identities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Null/Empty Identity] Can Identity::User contain empty strings, null bytes, or whitespace-only strings, and if allowed, how do storage backends handle these degenerate identities - potentially matching any user? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Policy Size Limits] Is there a maximum size for Policy objects, and can attackers cause policy rejection by creating policies that exceed backend storage limits, leading to denial of service through policy application failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Edge Case] [Capability Subset] If one Permission grants subset of capabilities of another Permission for same Identity, is this detected as redundancy or treated as separate grants, affecting policy evaluation performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Policy Translation] How is the abstract Policy model translated to concrete Vault policies, and can this translation introduce vulnerabilities where intended restrictions are not properly enforced in Vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Token Creation] When creating Vault tokens based on policies, are token capabilities properly restricted, or can token permissions exceed what the policy specifies due to translation bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Policy Path Construction] Can attackers exploit path traversal in policy paths when constructing Vault policy paths, gaining access to secrets outside their authorized namespace? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Namespace Separation] Is namespace separation properly maintained when translating policies to Vault, or can policies for one namespace accidentally grant access to another namespace's keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Default Policy Addition] The Vault integration automatically adds 'aptos_default' policy - does this create an unexpected permission escalation vector where all users inherit baseline permissions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Policy Update Atomicity] When updating Vault policies for a key, is the update atomic, or can race conditions lead to windows where the key has no policy or overly permissive policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [Vault Integration] [Root Policy Protection] Can user-defined policies override Vault's 'root' and 'default' policies, and if so, can attackers exploit this to escalate privileges or bypass fundamental Vault security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/policy.rs] [OnDisk Integration] [Policy Enforcement] OnDiskStorage explicitly states it provides 'no permission checks' - does this mean Policy objects are completely ignored for on-disk storage, exposing all keys to any process with filesystem access? (Critical)"
