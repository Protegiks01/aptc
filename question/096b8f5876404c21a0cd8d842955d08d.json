  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExternalChecks] [Type confusion] Can a malicious external checker implementation return inconsistent types from get_exp_checkers() and get_stackless_bytecode_checkers() across multiple calls, causing type confusion vulnerabilities when the compiler caches or reuses checker instances? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExternalChecks] [Resource exhaustion] Could a malicious external checker implementation return an unbounded number of checkers from get_exp_checkers() or get_stackless_bytecode_checkers(), consuming excessive memory and causing DoS during compilation of malicious Move contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExpChecker] [Recursive explosion] Can a malicious ExpChecker implementation in visit_expr_pre() or visit_expr_post() trigger infinite recursion by manipulating the FunctionEnv or ExpData, causing stack overflow and compiler crashes when processing specially crafted Move code? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExpChecker] [State mutation] Could a malicious ExpChecker modify the FunctionEnv or ExpData passed as mutable references in visit_expr_pre() or visit_expr_post(), corrupting the AST and causing the compiler to generate invalid bytecode that bypasses safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: StacklessBytecodeChecker] [Bytecode tampering] Can a malicious StacklessBytecodeChecker implementation modify the FunctionTarget during check(), altering bytecode instructions to bypass gas metering, type safety, or resource ownership checks in the final compiled module? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: get_name()] [Name collision] Could multiple external checkers return identical names from get_name(), causing the lint suppression system (#[lint::skip(name)]) to suppress the wrong checker or bypass critical security checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: visit_expr_pre()/visit_expr_post()] [Order dependency] Are there race conditions or ordering issues when multiple ExpCheckers visit the same expression, where one checker's side effects could influence another's behavior in unexpected ways leading to missed vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: report()] [Message injection] Can a malicious checker inject formatted strings or escape sequences into the msg parameter of report() that manipulate terminal output, hide critical warnings, or execute commands when developers view compilation output? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: report()] [Path traversal] Could a malicious checker craft checker_name values containing path traversal sequences (../, etc.) that cause the LINTER_URL_BASE link generation to point to malicious documentation sites when users click the linter reference links? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: known_checker_names()] [Set manipulation] Can the BTreeSet returned by known_checker_names() be manipulated through malicious checker implementations to exclude certain checker names, allowing lint suppression attributes to bypass all checks? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExternalChecks] [Dynamic dispatch bypass] Could type confusion in the Box<dyn ExpChecker> or Box<dyn StacklessBytecodeChecker> implementations allow an attacker to provide objects that don't properly implement the trait, bypassing all checking logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExternalChecks] [Vtable corruption] Is there any unsafe code path where the vtable pointers for trait objects (dyn ExternalChecks, dyn ExpChecker, dyn StacklessBytecodeChecker) could be corrupted, allowing arbitrary code execution during checker invocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: fmt() Debug impl] [Format string injection] Can the Debug implementation for dyn ExternalChecks be exploited through malicious checker names containing format string specifiers that cause panics, information disclosure, or undefined behavior when the checker collection is logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: ExpChecker] [Default method bypass] Since visit_expr_pre() and visit_expr_post() have default no-op implementations, could a malicious checker accidentally or deliberately fail to override these methods, causing critical security checks to be silently skipped during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Trait: StacklessBytecodeChecker] [Panic safety] If a StacklessBytecodeChecker panics during check(), could this leave the compiler in an inconsistent state where subsequent modules are compiled without proper validation, creating exploitable bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Type: Arc<dyn ExternalChecks>] [Race condition] In known_checker_names(), are there race conditions when multiple threads access the same Arc<dyn ExternalChecks> instances concurrently, potentially causing checkers to be invoked multiple times or skipped entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Type: Arc<dyn ExternalChecks>] [Use after free] Could the Arc reference counting be manipulated to prematurely drop ExternalChecks implementations while they're still being used by the compiler, causing use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: known_checker_names()] [Concurrent modification] Is the Vec<Arc<dyn ExternalChecks>> parameter safe to access concurrently, or could simultaneous checker registration and name collection cause data races and memory corruption?

(Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: report()] [Attribute injection] Can a malicious checker use report() to inject crafted checker_name values that create syntactically invalid #[lint::skip()] attributes, causing compiler errors or bypassing the suppression mechanism entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: report()] [Note injection] Could the notes vector generated in report() be exploited by injecting newlines or special characters in checker_name to hide critical warnings or insert misleading suppression instructions? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/external_checks.rs] [Function: get_name()] [Name validation] Is there any validation that checker names returned by get_name() conform to valid identifier syntax, or could special characters/whitespace cause parsing errors in lint suppression attributes?
