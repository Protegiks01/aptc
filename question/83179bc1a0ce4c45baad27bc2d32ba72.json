  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_deserialize_and_cache_script()] [Hash Collision Attack] The function uses sha3_256 for script caching - can attackers find hash collisions to cache malicious scripts under hashes of legitimate scripts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_deserialize_and_cache_script()] [Cache Poisoning Race] Can concurrent deserialization of the same script cause race conditions where partially deserialized or malicious scripts get cached? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_deserialize_and_cache_script()] [Script Cache Overflow] Is there a limit on script cache size, or can attackers force caching of unbounded numbers of scripts causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_verify_and_cache_script()] [Verification Bypass via Cache] If a script is found in cache as Deserialized but not Verified, is the verification properly atomic or can it be bypassed by cache manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_verify_and_cache_script()] [Immediate Dependencies Loading] When loading immediate_dependencies, are circular dependencies properly detected or can cyclic module references cause infinite loops? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_verify_and_cache_script()] [Module Verification State] When build_verified_script() is called with immediate_dependencies, have all those dependencies been verified or could unverified modules be used? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Function: unmetered_verify_and_cache_script()] [Script Verification Race] Between checking get_script() and calling insert_verified_script(), can another thread verify and cache a different version of the script? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: StructDefinitionLoader::is_lazy_loading_enabled()] [Debug Assert Bypass] The function uses debug_assert! which is stripped in release builds - can this cause undefined behavior if lazy loading is mistakenly enabled in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: StructDefinitionLoader::load_struct_definition()] [Struct Name Index Bounds] Does idx_to_struct_name_ref() properly validate the StructNameIndex bounds, or can out-of-bounds indices cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: StructDefinitionLoader::load_struct_definition()] [Gas Meter Ignored] The _gas_meter parameter is ignored - this means struct loading in eager mode is completely unmetered, allowing free access to arbitrary struct definitions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: FunctionDefinitionLoader::load_function_definition()] [Error Status Code Remapping] The function remaps errors to FUNCTION_RESOLUTION_FAILURE - can this hide more serious errors like memory corruption or access violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: FunctionDefinitionLoader::load_function_definition()] [Unmetered Function Loading] Like struct loading, this ignores the gas_meter - can attackers load expensive function definitions without gas charges? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: NativeModuleLoader::charge_native_result_load_module()] [Arena Allocation Overflow] Can the referenced_module_ids arena overflow if a native function loads too many modules, causing memory safety issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: NativeModuleLoader::charge_native_result_load_module()] [Error Message Information Leakage] The error message reveals whether a module exists - can this be exploited for module discovery attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: ModuleMetadataLoader::load_module_for_metadata()] [Backwards Compatibility Vulnerability] The comment says metadata accesses were never metered for backwards compatibility - can this be exploited for DoS by repeatedly loading expensive metadata? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: ModuleMetadataLoader::load_module_for_metadata()] [Deserialized Module State] The function loads deserialized but not verified modules - can unverified module metadata contain malicious data? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: InstantiatedFunctionLoaderHelper::load_ty_arg()] [Type Loading Unmetered] This calls unmetered_load_type() - can complex generic types be loaded for free, bypassing gas limits? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: InstantiatedFunctionLoader::load_instantiated_function()] [Dependency Charging Order] Are dependencies charged before or after function loading - can out-of-gas after dependency charging leave side effects? (Medium)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: Loader::unmetered_module_storage()] [Unsafe Native Access] This returns raw module storage without metering - what prevents native functions from exploiting this for unlimited storage access? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/loader/eager.rs] [Impl: ScriptLoader::load_script()] [Script Dependency Charging] The TODO comment asks if script itself should be charged - does this mean scripts currently load for free? (Medium)",
