  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/lib.rs] [Module: lib.rs] [Unsafe code policy] Does the #![forbid(unsafe_code)] attribute at the crate level successfully prevent all unsafe code blocks from being introduced in the benchmark, plot, and z3log submodules, or can submodules override this restriction? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/lib.rs] [Module: benchmark] [Dependency exposure] Does the public export of the benchmark module expose any functions that could be misused to exhaust system resources or create denial-of-service conditions during prover benchmarking? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/lib.rs] [Module: plot] [Dependency exposure] Does the public export of the plot module expose SVG generation functions that could be exploited to create maliciously crafted SVG files with XXE or other injection vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/lib.rs] [Module: z3log] [Dependency exposure] Does the public export of the z3log module expose Z3 trace file parsing functions that could be exploited with maliciously crafted trace files to cause crashes or resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/lib.rs] [Module structure] [Visibility control] Are the benchmark, plot, and z3log modules correctly scoped as public (`pub mod`), or should they have restricted visibility to prevent unintended external access? (Low)"
