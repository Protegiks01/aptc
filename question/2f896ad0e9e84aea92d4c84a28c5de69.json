  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: TelemetryDump] [Timestamp Validation] Can timestamp_micros contain zero or special values (u64::MAX) that cause logic errors in time-based validation or rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Timestamp Conversion Loss] When converting from String microseconds to u64 seconds in event_timestamp, is precision properly maintained or lost? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [Struct: BigQueryRow] [Time Zone Issues] Does event_timestamp assume UTC, and can timezone confusion cause incorrect time-series ordering in analytics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Input Validation] Are there comprehensive input validation functions for all struct fields, or do they rely solely on type system guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Whitelist Validation] Are event names and param keys validated against whitelists, or can arbitrary strings be submitted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Content Security] Is there sanitization to prevent control characters, ANSI codes, or terminal escape sequences in telemetry data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Business Logic Bypass] Can validators submit semantically invalid telemetry (negative metrics, impossible state transitions) that bypass business logic validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Trust Model] Does the telemetry system properly authenticate sources, or can untrusted parties submit telemetry affecting network visibility? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Authorization Checks] Are there per-node authorization checks ensuring validators can only submit their own telemetry, not forge others' data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Rate Limiting] Is telemetry submission rate-limited per validator, or can malicious nodes flood the system with excessive reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Quota Management] Are there storage quotas per validator for telemetry data, or can a single node consume disproportionate BigQuery resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Schema Evolution] If struct fields are added or removed, will old clients sending legacy formats cause deserialization failures or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Version Mismatch] Can version mismatches between telemetry client and service cause incompatibility issues or security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Deprecation Handling] If fields are deprecated, do old validators continue sending deprecated data that could conflict with new schema? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Anomaly Detection] Is there monitoring to detect anomalous telemetry patterns indicating compromise or malicious behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Error Rate Monitoring] Are deserialization errors tracked per validator to identify nodes sending malformed telemetry? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry-service/src/types/telemetry.rs] [All Structs] [Volume Monitoring] Is telemetry volume per validator tracked to detect flooding or resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)"
