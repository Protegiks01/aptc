  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Struct: StructEntry] [Empty Struct Detection] The is_empty_struct field at line 391 is set to false by default - is this correctly updated when parsing empty structs, or can this flag be incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Receiver Function Validation] At lines 403-405, receiver functions are identified by checking if the first parameter is named 'self' - can an attacker define a non-receiver function with a 'self' parameter to bypass receiver function restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Type Skipping] At line 407, param.1.skip_reference() is used to get the base type - does this correctly handle mutable vs immutable references, or can &mut self be treated differently from &self causing access control bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Cross-Module Receiver Functions] At lines 449-454, receiver functions for structs in other modules generate warnings but don't prevent registration - can an attacker define receiver functions for standard library types to shadow legitimate operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Generic Type Validation] The check_generics closure at lines 426-443 validates type parameters - but does it prevent using the same type parameter in different positions with different constraints, causing type system confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Duplicate Type Parameter Detection] At lines 436-442, duplicate type parameters are detected with seen.insert(ty) - but is this comparison based on parameter index or parameter name, and can parameter renaming bypass this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Module Boundary Check] At line 450, the check entry.module_id != mid prevents cross-module receiver functions - but is this check performed before or after the function is added to fun_table, potentially leaving it registered?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Struct Entry Mutation] At lines 462-465, struct_entry.receiver_functions is mutated directly - can concurrent access to this map cause race conditions if multiple threads are building different modules simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Vector Receiver Validation] At lines 470-473, vector receiver functions must be in the stdlib vector module - but is the stdlib address validated to prevent address spoofing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Vector Generic Validation] At line 480, check_generics is called with [*elem_ty.clone()] - does cloning the elem_ty preserve all type constraints, or can constraints be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Error Type Handling] At lines 485-487, Type::Error is silently ignored - can an attacker exploit malformed AST to create functions with Error types that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Unsupported Type Warning] At lines 488-491, unsupported receiver types generate warnings - but does this prevent the function from being registered, or can it still be called with unsafe type casts?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Final Table Insert] At line 495, fun_table.insert() can silently overwrite existing functions - are function overloading rules enforced, or can this cause non-deterministic function resolution?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Type Display Context] The type_ctx closure at lines 408-412 creates a TypeDisplayContext - can this context be exploited to display misleading type information in error messages, confusing developers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/model_builder.rs] [Function: define_fun()] [Warning vs Error] Multiple locations use Severity::Warning instead of Error for invalid receiver functions - can attackers rely on users ignoring warnings to deploy vulnerable contracts?
