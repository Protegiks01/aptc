  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Deserialization attack] Does the bcs::from_bytes() call validate the structure and size of PREBUILT_BUNDLE_BYTES before deserialization, or can a malicious .mpb file with crafted BCS data cause memory exhaustion, infinite loops, or stack overflow during deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Type confusion] Can an attacker replace the prebuilt.mpb file with a binary blob that deserializes to a PrebuiltPackagesBundle with malformed type signatures, causing type confusion when modules are later loaded into the Move VM and potentially bypassing type safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-24] [Panic-based DoS] Does the .expect() on line 24 mean that any deserialization failure causes a panic during lazy initialization, and can an attacker deliberately corrupt the prebuilt.mpb file to cause permanent application crashes whenever PreBuiltPackagesImpl is first accessed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Integer overflow] Does BCS deserialization check for integer overflow when parsing length prefixes in the PrebuiltPackagesBundle structure, or can a malicious .mpb file with crafted length fields cause integer overflow leading to buffer overruns or incorrect memory allocation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Recursive bomb] Can a malicious PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain deeply nested BTreeMap structures that cause stack overflow during BCS deserialization, exploiting the lack of depth limits in the deserializer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Size validation] Does include_bytes!() impose any size limit on the prebuilt.mpb file, or can an attacker provide an arbitrarily large binary blob that exhausts memory during compilation or runtime deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Checksum bypass] Is there any integrity check (checksum, hash, signature) on PREBUILT_BUNDLE_BYTES before deserialization to detect corruption or tampering, or does the code blindly trust the binary data loaded at compile time? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Version mismatch] Does BCS deserialization validate that the PrebuiltPackagesBundle format version matches the expected version, or can an old/incompatible .mpb file from a different Aptos version cause undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities when deserialized? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [Malicious BTreeMap] Can a PrebuiltPackagesBundle with duplicate keys in the BTreeMap<String, PrebuiltPackage> cause unexpected behavior during deserialization, potentially allowing package shadowing or overwriting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 23-25] [UTF-8 validation] Does BCS deserialization validate that package names (BTreeMap keys) are valid UTF-8 strings without control characters or malicious Unicode sequences that could cause issues in logging, display, or further processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 4-6] [Supply chain] Since this file is auto-generated by testsuite/benchmark-workloads/generate.py, can an attacker compromise the generation script to inject malicious Move bytecode into the prebuilt.mpb file, which would then be compiled into production binaries and executed during transaction workloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Build-time injection] Does the build process verify the authenticity and integrity of the prebuilt.mpb file before include_bytes!() embeds it into the binary, or can a malicious prebuilt.mpb be substituted during the build pipeline to inject backdoored Move modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Path traversal] Can the env!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 4-6] [Generation script vulnerability] Does testsuite/benchmark-workloads/generate.py validate and sanitize all input Move source files before compiling them into prebuilt.mpb, or can malicious Move code with backdoors or vulnerabilities be included in the prebuilt packages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 16-17] [File replacement] In a CI/CD or development environment, can an attacker replace the prebuilt.mpb file after it's generated but before compilation, injecting malicious packages that will be executed during benchmarks and potentially compromise validator nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 4-6] [Version control bypass] Since the comment says 'Do not modify' and the file is auto-generated, can developers accidentally commit a manually modified malicious version that bypasses the generation script's validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 1-36] [Reproducible builds] Are the prebuilt packages deterministic (reproducible builds), or can slight differences in build environments introduce variations that could hide malicious bytecode injections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 16-17] [Dependency confusion] Can an attacker exploit the CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR environment variable or Cargo's dependency resolution to cause the wrong prebuilt.mpb file to be included, potentially loading packages from a malicious crate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Malicious bytecode] Can the PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain Move modules with malicious bytecode that exploits vulnerabilities in the Move VM's bytecode verifier, allowing arbitrary code execution or bypassing resource safety guarantees when the modules are published and executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Bytecode verification bypass] Does the Move VM re-verify all module bytecode from PrebuiltPackagesBundle before execution, or does it trust prebuilt packages to skip verification, potentially allowing malicious bytecode that violates Move's type safety or resource model? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Native function abuse] Can prebuilt packages contain malicious calls to native functions that are intended to be restricted, allowing unauthorized access to system resources, private keys, or validator state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Gas metering bypass] Can modules in PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain bytecode sequences that exploit gas metering vulnerabilities, allowing infinite loops or excessive computation without consuming gas, causing validator nodes to hang during benchmark execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Script injection] Can the PrebuiltPackagesBundle contain malicious scripts that execute privileged operations, manipulate global state, or transfer funds when invoked through the transaction workload generator? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/prebuilt_packages.rs] [Line: 33-35] [Backdoor functions] Can prebuilt Move modules contain hidden backdoor entry points (e.g., undocumented public functions) that allow unauthorized state manipulation when called through crafted transactions during workload generation?
