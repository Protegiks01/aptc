  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Field: profile_options (all commands)] [Profile Manipulation] Can an attacker modify the profile configuration to point private_key_options to a different profile's keys, enabling unauthorized access to other accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Default Expiry Exploit] The default expiry_offset_secs is 60 seconds (line 43) - can an attacker exploit tight timing windows where transactions expire during propagation, causing failed but gas-consuming transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransactionArgs::expiry_time()] [Expiry Precision] SystemTime resolution may vary by platform - can inconsistent time precision across CLI, servers, and validators cause unexpected expiry behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Account Creation Race] If two CreateAccount commands are submitted concurrently for the same new_account, does one properly fail or can both succeed, causing duplicate account state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: TransferCommand::execute()] [Transfer Race] Can concurrent Transfer commands from the same sender cause race conditions where total transferred amount exceeds balance due to stale sequence numbers? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Pool Creation Race] Can rapid stake pool creation exhaust validator set capacity or cause the blockchain to accept more validators than the BFT consensus can safely handle? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateStakePoolCommand::execute()] [Commission Change After Creation] After creating a stake pool with commission_percentage, can the operator change it without delegator consent by submitting another transaction? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: SetVoterCommand::execute()] [Vote Delegation Chain] Can voter delegation be chained (A delegates to B, B delegates to C) to bypass vote weight limits or create circular delegation loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [Function: CreateAccountCommand::execute()] [Special Address Characters] Does load_account_arg (line 102) properly validate address format, or can special characters or whitespace cause parsing errors that leak information? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [All Commands] [Front-Running] Can an attacker observe pending transactions in mempool and submit competing transactions with higher gas prices to front-run stake pool creation, operator changes, or transfers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta-cli/src/construction.rs] [All Commands] [Sandwich Attack] In blocks with multiple transactions, can an attacker sandwich victim transactions (submit before and after) to manipulate state and extract value? (Medium)",
