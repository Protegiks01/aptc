  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Struct: StreamHeader] [ID Space Exhaustion] With u32 request_ids, after 4.3 billion messages, IDs wrap - does the system handle this gracefully or could long-running validators encounter issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: InboundStream::append_fragment()] [Data Ownership] Vec::append() at lines 142-145 takes ownership of fragment.raw_data - if the fragment is accidentally cloned or shared, could append() be called twice causing duplication? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: OutboundStream::stream_message()] [Fragment Data Integrity] Vec::from(chunk) at line 228 creates a copy - but is there validation that the original message wasn't modified between split_off() and fragment creation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: InboundStream::append_fragment()] [Message Mutation] After appending fragments, the NetworkMessage is mutated in place - could this violate assumptions made by upstream code that expects immutable messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Struct: StreamFragment] [Raw Data Integrity] No checksums or hashes validate fragment integrity - can network errors cause silent data corruption during transmission? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Version Compatibility] StreamHeader/StreamFragment derive Serialize (lines 14, 21, 30) - are these formats versioned? Could old/new nodes have incompatible serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Deserialization Bomb] Can a malicious peer craft a serialized StreamHeader that expands to gigabytes when deserialized (e.g., compressed data)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Attribute: serde_bytes] [Bypass Validation] The serde_bytes attribute (line 35) treats Vec<u8> specially - does this bypass serde's normal length limits allowing oversized fragments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Derive: Arbitrary] [Fuzzing Coverage] proptest_derive::Arbitrary (lines 10, 15, 22, 31) generates random instances - does fuzzing cover all integer overflow/underflow cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type: MultiplexMessage] [Message Multiplexing] MultiplexMessage wraps StreamMessage (line 222) - can attacker interleave StreamMessages with other message types to confuse stream assembly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Type: NetworkMessage] [Message Type Validation] NetworkMessage has multiple variants (Error, RpcRequest, RpcResponse, DirectSendMsg) - does each variant have consistent size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: OutboundStream::should_stream()] [Boundary Condition] Line 180 checks data_len() > max_frame_size - what about messages exactly equal to max_frame_size? Are they streamed unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: OutboundStream::should_stream()] [Decision Logic] The decision to stream is based solely on size - but should certain message types (e.g., consensus votes) never be fragmented for performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Struct: InboundStreamBuffer] [Max Fragments Configuration] max_fragments (line 63) is configurable - what are safe bounds? Could too-large values enable memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Struct: OutboundStream] [Frame Size Configuration] max_frame_size is reduced by 64 bytes (line 164) - is this constant appropriate for all message types? Could some headers exceed 64 bytes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Struct: OutboundStream] [Message Size Limits] max_message_size (line 153) limits total message size - but is this enforced before or after serialization? Could serialization overhead cause actual network frames to exceed limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Function: OutboundStream::new()] [Configuration Validation] The assertion at line 165 validates configuration - should this be a runtime error instead of panic to allow graceful degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Byzantine Attack] [Fragment Flooding] Can a Byzantine peer send thousands of headers without completing any streams, exhausting InboundStreamBuffer resources across all connections? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Byzantine Attack] [Partial Stream Attack] Can a Byzantine peer send header + some fragments but never complete streams, causing memory to be held indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Byzantine Attack] [Request ID Prediction] If request_id generation is predictable (sequential U32IdGenerator), can an attacker pre-send fragments for future streams causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Byzantine Attack] [Fragment Duplication] Can an attacker send duplicate fragments with the same fragment_id to cause the check at line 133 to fail repeatedly, wasting CPU? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Byzantine Attack] [Stream Replacement DoS] By sending new headers repeatedly (exploiting line 77), can an attacker prevent any legitimate stream from completing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Consensus Impact] [Vote Message Fragmentation] If consensus vote messages are fragmented, could delayed fragment arrival cause timeout and consensus delays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Consensus Impact] [Block Proposal Streaming] Large block proposals might be streamed - if fragments arrive out of order or delayed, could this cause proposal timeout and leader rotation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/stream/mod.rs] [Consensus Impact] [Validator Communication] If stream assembly fails between validators, could this cause network partition-like symptoms affecting consensus liveness? (Critical)"
