  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 17: RELEASE_CONFIG constant] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker modify the included release.yaml file at compile time to inject malicious governance proposals, potentially allowing unauthorized protocol changes or fund theft when the binary is distributed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 17: include_str! macro] [Supply chain attack] Does the compile-time inclusion of release.yaml create a supply chain vulnerability where compromised build environments could inject malicious configurations that persist in released binaries?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 20: ReleaseConfig::parse()] [YAML deserialization attack] Can specially crafted YAML in release.yaml exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in serde_yaml to cause memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, or bypass security checks during proposal generation?

  "[File: aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/lib.rs] [Line 20: .expect() panic] [DoS during initialization] If ReleaseConfig::parse() fails, does the panic occur on first access to current_release_config(), creating a race condition where some threads successfully initialize while others panic?
