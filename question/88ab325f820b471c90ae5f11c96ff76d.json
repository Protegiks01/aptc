  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Error Propagation] When package_cache.resolve_git_revision() fails, the error is propagated - can this leave the lock in a partially updated state where entry is vacant but resolution failed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Oid Parsing Panic] If Oid::from_str() fails on line 83, it returns an error - but can invalid cached commit hashes cause repeated failures that prevent any package resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Network Error Handling] When client.get_ledger_information() fails, does the error provide enough context for debugging, or can vague errors hide security issues like MITM attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: load_from_file_or_empty()] [Partial Deserialization] If TOML deserialization partially succeeds before failing, can this leave the PackageLock in an invalid state with some fields initialized and others not? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [Write Failure Recovery] If fs::write() fails after toml::to_string_pretty() succeeds, can this cause loss of lock data or leave orphaned temp files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Hash Collision] Although SHA-1 collisions are now practical, does the code properly handle potential collisions in git commit hashes, or can attackers exploit this for dependency substitution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Short Hash Ambiguity] Does the code require full commit hashes, or can abbreviated hashes be used allowing ambiguity attacks where multiple commits match the same short hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Hash Format Validation] Are commit hashes validated to be 40-character hex strings (SHA-1) or appropriate length for other hash algorithms, preventing format confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Git Clone Bomb] Can an attacker provide a git URL that points to a repository with extremely large history or blobs that cause resource exhaustion during resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Slow Loris] Can an attacker control fullnode_url to point to a slow server that drips responses, causing timeouts and blocking the build process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can repeated calls to save_to_file with large lock contents cause disk space exhaustion, especially if temp files are created and not cleaned up? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [Map Growth] Can an attacker cause unbounded growth of git or on_chain BTreeMaps by repeatedly resolving unique but invalid dependencies, leading to OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: load_from_file_or_empty()] [TOML Injection] Can malicious TOML content with special syntax cause the parser to execute unintended operations or bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: save_to_file()] [TOML Escaping] Are string values properly escaped in TOML output to prevent injection of malicious TOML syntax through git URLs or commit hashes containing special characters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: load_from_file_or_empty()] [TOML Unicode] Can Unicode normalization issues in TOML parsing cause different strings to map to the same BTreeMap keys, enabling collision attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: load_from_file_or_empty()] [TOML Version Compatibility] If the toml crate is upgraded, can backwards incompatible changes cause existing lock files to parse incorrectly or fail to load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Key Normalization] The key repo_loc_and_rev combines identity and rev with '@' - can ambiguous inputs create identical keys for different dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [String Allocation] Does the repeated .clone() on line 76 and 79 cause unnecessary allocations that could be exploited for memory exhaustion with many dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [ToString Allocation] Does node_identity.to_string() allocate efficiently, or can repeated calls cause performance degradation in dependency-heavy projects? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [General] [String Interning] Are repeated identical string keys (URLs, commit hashes) interned or deduplicated, or does each entry allocate separate strings causing memory bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing Default Trait] The new() function has #[allow(clippy::new_without_default)] - does the lack of Default trait implementation cause issues in generic contexts expecting Default? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [Return Type Consistency] The function returns Oid but stores String internally - can this type mismatch cause issues if Oid and String representations diverge? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_network_version()] [Version Type Safety] Storing versions as u64 - can version numbers exceed u64 range in future blockchain implementations, causing overflow or truncation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Struct: PackageLock] [Missing Invariants] There are no documented invariants about the relationship between git and on_chain maps - can they get out of sync and cause build inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-resolver/src/lock.rs] [Function: resolve_git_revision()] [PackageCache Trust] The function trusts PackageCache to return correct commit IDs - can a compromised or buggy cache return malicious commits that get locked? (High)"
