  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: scaling_factor()] [Division by zero bypass] Can an attacker manipulate on-chain gas parameters to set gas_unit_scaling_factor to 0, which would cause the function to return 1 instead of 0, potentially bypassing gas checks or causing incorrect gas calculations across all transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: scaling_factor()] [Integer overflow] If gas_unit_scaling_factor is set to u64::MAX through governance manipulation, can the conversion at line 290 cause an overflow when multiplied with other gas values, leading to incorrect gas metering and potential DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: scaling_factor()] [State inconsistency] Can concurrent updates to gas_unit_scaling_factor during epoch transitions cause different validators to use different scaling factors for the same transaction, breaking deterministic execution and causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Constant: GAS_SCALING_FACTOR] [Economic manipulation] The hardcoded value of 1,000,000 at line 21 creates a fixed conversion rate - can this be exploited if the on-chain gas_unit_scaling_factor diverges significantly from this constant, allowing transactions to consume more resources than they pay for? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: scaling_factor()] [Type confusion] Since the function returns GasScalingFactor type which wraps u64, can type conversions in calling code cause precision loss or overflow when scaling gas values up and down? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Integer underflow] At line 299-301, checked_sub is used but falls back to 0 on underflow - can an attacker craft transactions with size exactly at large_transaction_cutoff to consistently trigger the fallback path and avoid paying per-byte gas fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Integer overflow] At line 303, INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE is multiplied by excess bytes then added to MIN_TRANSACTION_GAS_UNITS - can extremely large transactions cause this multiplication to overflow, wrapping to a small gas value and enabling DoS attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Gas manipulation] Can an attacker submit a transaction with size just below large_transaction_cutoff (600 bytes), then have it expanded during execution to avoid the per-byte gas charges calculated at line 299-301? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Boundary condition] What happens if large_transaction_cutoff is set to 0 through governance? Would all transactions pay INTRINSIC_GAS_PER_BYTE for their entire size, potentially making small transactions prohibitively expensive and breaking the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Type safety violation] The function returns a GasExpression trait object - can malicious implementations of this trait cause non-deterministic gas calculations across validators when evaluated? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Gas bypass] If transaction_size parameter is manipulated to report a smaller size than actual payload, can attackers bypass intrinsic gas charges while still executing large transaction payloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Function: calculate_intrinsic_gas()] [Denial of service] Can an attacker set intrinsic_gas_per_byte to u64::MAX through governance manipulation, making all transactions above the cutoff impossible to execute due to gas overflow? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_transaction_gas_units] [Economic attack] The default value of 2,760,000 represents a minimum cost - can an attacker with governance control reduce this to near-zero, enabling spam attacks that consume validator resources without adequate payment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_transaction_gas_units] [Validator resource exhaustion] Can min_transaction_gas_units be set so low that adversaries can flood the mempool with millions of minimum-gas transactions, overwhelming validator memory and causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_transaction_gas_units] [Differential pricing] The comment mentions 'variable to charge more for expensive authenticators like keyless' - can this differential pricing be exploited to submit expensive authentication transactions at the base rate, causing validator CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: min_transaction_gas_units] [Integer overflow] If this value is set to a number close to InternalGas maximum, can adding it to other gas charges cause overflow and wrap to small values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: large_transaction_cutoff] [Gas evasion] With cutoff at 600 bytes, can attackers design transactions that compress payload to stay under 600 bytes, then expand during execution to evade per-byte charges? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: large_transaction_cutoff] [Governance manipulation] Can malicious governance proposals set large_transaction_cutoff to u64::MAX, effectively eliminating per-byte gas charges for all transactions and enabling storage bloat attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: large_transaction_cutoff] [Economic imbalance] If cutoff is set too low (e.g., 1 byte), would all transactions pay excessive per-byte fees, making the network economically unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: intrinsic_gas_per_byte] [DoS amplification] Can setting intrinsic_gas_per_byte to 0 allow attackers to submit multi-megabyte transactions that consume validator bandwidth and storage without paying proportional gas costs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: intrinsic_gas_per_byte] [Integer overflow] At value 1,158, can multiplication with a large excess byte count (e.g., 1MB transaction) cause overflow when calculating total intrinsic gas? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: maximum_number_of_gas_units] [Integer constraint] The parameter uses aptos_global_constants::MAX_GAS_AMOUNT - if this constant differs from the actual u64 maximum gas calculations can handle, can overflow occur in gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs] [Parameter: maximum_number_of_gas_units] [Economic invariant] The comment requires 'MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_GAS_UNITS * MAX_PRICE_PER_GAS_UNIT < min(u64::MAX, GasUnits<GasCarrier>::MAX)' - is this invariant enforced on-chain, or can governance updates violate it causing arithmetic overflow?
