  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [BCS compatibility] Are the BCS serialization format and encoding() method outputs identical, or can discrepancies between serde and manual encoding cause state inconsistencies? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: Ord/PartialOrd] [Ordering consistency] Does the derived Ord implementation produce a consistent total ordering of StateKeyInner values that matches the encoding byte order used for storage indexing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Derive: Ord/PartialOrd] [Cross-variant ordering] How are different StateKeyInner variants ordered relative to each other (AccessPath < TableItem < Raw?), and could this ordering be exploited to manipulate storage iteration order?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Enum: StateKeyDecodeErr] [NotEnoughBytes precision] Does the NotEnoughBytes error accurately report the expected vs actual byte count, and could incorrect reporting mask buffer overread vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/state_store/state_key/inner.rs] [Enum: StateKeyDecodeErr] [Error recovery] When decode errors occur, can the storage system safely skip corrupted state keys and continue, or will a single corrupted key halt all state access? (High)",
