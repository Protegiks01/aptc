  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Consensus Impact] If panics occur during critical consensus-related API operations (block queries, validator set queries, transaction submission), does panic_handler's suppression prevent proper error propagation to consensus components that expect transaction failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Debug Information Leakage] Does the {:?} debug formatter at line 50 expose internal type information, memory addresses, or implementation details that should not be logged even in internal logs due to potential log exfiltration attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Panic Source Obfuscation] By returning generic 'internal error' messages, does panic_handler prevent legitimate users from distinguishing between temporary failures (retry-able) and permanent failures (invalid request), causing unnecessary retries that amplify load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Monitoring Blind Spots] Does the conversion of panics to InternalError code 600 prevent proper alerting and monitoring since panics are masked as regular errors rather than critical failures requiring immediate investigation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: panic_handler()] [Transaction Integrity] When panics occur during transaction validation or submission, can the suppression cause transactions to be silently dropped without proper error responses to clients, leading to loss of user funds or double-submission attempts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_panic_response()] [Error Code Misuse] By using InternalError code 600 for all panics at line 57, does this prevent security teams from distinguishing between different panic categories (assertion failures, out-of-bounds, arithmetic overflow) critical for root cause analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_panic_response()] [Generic Error String] The hardcoded 'internal error' string at line 51 provides no actionable information - can this allow attackers to trigger panics without detection since all panics return identical responses making attack pattern analysis impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Function: build_panic_response()] [Response Consistency] If into_response() at line 59 itself panics (recursive panic), does Rust's panic handler catch this or does it cause validator process termination affecting network liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Functions: convert_error() + panic_handler()] [Error Hierarchy Bypass] Can attackers trigger conditions where both panic_handler and convert_error are invoked for the same request, causing duplicate error responses or inconsistent state in the HTTP connection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Functions: build_error_response() + build_panic_response()] [Error Code Collision] Since both functions create AptosError responses, can the distinction between WebFrameworkError (601) and InternalError (600) be confused in downstream logging or monitoring systems leading to incorrect security classifications? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Functions: All] [Async Safety] None of the functions use async locks or synchronization - if multiple concurrent errors occur, can race conditions in the Poem framework's error handling pipeline cause errors to be attributed to wrong requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Functions: All] [Memory Safety] Do the take_body() and set_body() operations at line 31 properly handle ownership and prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities if the response is accessed concurrently during error conversion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: API Middleware] [Middleware Bypass] Since convert_error is registered after all middleware at line 259 of runtime.rs, can authentication or rate limiting errors bypass security middleware by being converted before security checks complete? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: API Middleware] [CORS Misconfiguration] Is convert_error applied before or after CORS middleware at line 254 of runtime.rs, and can this ordering allow error responses to leak to unauthorized origins bypassing same-origin policy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: Compression] [Compression Bombs] Since compression middleware at line 255 of runtime.rs is applied before error handling, can specially crafted error messages trigger compression bombs where small errors expand to gigabytes consuming validator bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: PostSizeLimit] [Size Limit Bypass] Can error responses bypass the PostSizeLimit middleware at line 256 of runtime.rs, allowing arbitrarily large error messages to be sent even when request size limits are enforced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: Transaction API] [VM Error Leakage] When VM execution errors from transaction submission contain vm_error_code fields, does convert_error properly preserve these codes or can they be lost during framework error conversion, preventing proper gas refund calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: Account API] [Account Privacy] Can account query errors leak information about account existence, balances, or transaction history through error message details that should be sanitized for privacy protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Integration: State API] [State Query Timing] Do errors from state queries reveal timing information about data availability (pruned vs not-found vs unauthorized) that can be exploited to infer validator state or synchronization status? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Messages] [SQL Injection via Logs] If error messages containing user input are logged and later queried from log databases, can SQL injection vulnerabilities arise in log analysis tools that don't sanitize these error strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Messages] [XSS in Error Viewers] Can error messages containing HTML or JavaScript be stored in monitoring dashboards or error tracking systems without sanitization, leading to stored XSS attacks when administrators view error reports? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Messages] [Log Injection] Can attackers inject newline characters or ANSI escape codes into error messages to forge log entries, hide their attacks, or manipulate log parsing by SIEM systems monitoring validator security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Error Messages] [Sensitive Data in Errors] Do framework errors from Poem include sensitive HTTP headers (Authorization, Cookie, API keys) in error messages that get logged or returned to clients exposing authentication credentials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Async: convert_error()] [Async Cancellation] If the async convert_error() function is cancelled mid-execution (e.g., client disconnects), can partial error responses be sent or can response state become corrupted affecting subsequent requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/error_converter.rs] [Async: convert_error()] [Task Ordering] Since convert_error is async but build_error_response is synchronous, can the async executor reorder operations causing error responses to be sent before security checks complete in other middleware? (High)"
