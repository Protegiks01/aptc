  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: expect_complete_result()] [Panic location] Does the panic in expect_complete_result() occur in a context where it can be caught and handled, or does it always crash the process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Batch processing] Can multiple ExecutedChunk instances be processed in parallel, and does this cause race conditions in state commits? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [Debug output] Does the Debug implementation leak sensitive state information that could aid attackers in timing or state manipulation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/executed_chunk.rs] [Struct: ExecutedChunk] [Debug output] Can the Debug implementation of ExecutedChunk expose raw signature data or internal state that aids cryptographic attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Struct: PartialStateComputeResult] [OnceCell poisoning] If a thread panics while setting a OnceCell value, does this poison the cell and make it permanently inaccessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_state_checkpoint_output()] [OnceCell::set failure] What happens if OnceCell::set() returns Err because the cell was already set by another thread - does the panic message accurately reflect this? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: set_ledger_update_output()] [OnceCell::set failure] Can the Err case of OnceCell::set() be exploited to trigger panics in specific execution paths chosen by attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: ensure_state_checkpoint_output()] [OnceCell::get None] Can ensure_state_checkpoint_output() be called before initialization in a way that causes validators to take different error paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: ensure_ledger_update_output()] [OnceCell::get None] Does the None case properly propagate context about why LedgerUpdateOutput wasn't set, or does it obscure the root cause? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: new()] [ExecutionOutput ownership] Does new() take ownership of ExecutionOutput or clone it, and can the original be modified after passing to PartialStateComputeResult? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/types/partial_state_compute_result.rs] [Function: get_complete_result()] [ExecutionOutput clone] Does cloning execution_output in get_complete_result() correctly deep-copy all nested state, or can shallow copies cause data races? (Medium)",
