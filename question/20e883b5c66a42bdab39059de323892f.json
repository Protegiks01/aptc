  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: abort_pipeline_for_state_sync()] [Incomplete abort] If new blocks are inserted while aborting pipelines, can they be missed causing some pipelines to remain active during state sync? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: abort_pipeline_for_state_sync()] [Deadlock potential] Can wait_until_finishes() calls deadlock if pipeline completion is waiting for locks held by the aborting thread? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: wait_for_payload()] [Timeout calculation overflow] The saturating_sub for duration calculation could produce zero timeout - can this cause immediate timeouts even when deadline hasn't passed? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: wait_for_payload()] [Payload availability race] Can the payload become unavailable between the timeout check and actual retrieval, causing inconsistent behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: check_payload()] [Partial availability exploit] Can blocks with partially available payloads pass the check but fail during execution, causing validator divergence? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: check_denied_inline_transactions()] [Filter bypass] Can transaction filters be bypassed by encoding denied transactions in non-inline formats or using payload indirection? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner() time check] [Clock skew attack] Can validators with slightly skewed clocks accept blocks at different times, causing temporary forks or view changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner() time check] [Timestamp overflow] Can block timestamps overflow the Duration::from_micros conversion causing panics or incorrect wait times? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner() time check] [Long wait DoS] The check warns if wait > 1 second but still waits - can attackers chain multiple such blocks to cause cumulative delays degrading liveness? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_block_inner() storage] [Atomicity violation] Can partial writes to storage.save_tree() succeed for blocks but fail for QCs, creating inconsistent persisted state? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_single_quorum_cert() storage] [Write-after-write hazard] Can concurrent calls to save_tree() for different QCs cause write conflicts or lost updates in the persistent storage? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: insert_2chain_timeout_certificate() storage] [Persistence-memory ordering] Can save_highest_2chain_timeout_cert succeed but replace_2chain_timeout_cert fail, causing storage to contain a TC not reflected in memory? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [BlockStore struct] [Lock ordering deadlock] The code uses both inner.read()/write() and pending_blocks.lock() - can incorrect lock ordering cause deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [BlockStore struct] [Reader-writer starvation] Can continuous read locks on inner prevent writes from completing, degrading consensus progress? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: send_for_execution() locks] [Multi-lock atomicity] The function acquires pending_blocks.lock() then inner.write() separately - can state changes between these locks cause inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: rebuild() locks] [Lock-free read hazard] Reading highest_2chain_timeout_cert() without explicit locking - can this read torn or inconsistent TC data on architectures without atomic pointer reads? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: pipeline_pending_latency()] [Timestamp subtraction underflow] Multiple saturating_sub calls - can underflows cause duration calculations to always return Duration::ZERO hiding actual latency? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/block_storage/block_store.rs] [Function: pipeline_pending_latency()] [Path length as metric] Using pending_path.len() as rounds could be incorrect if path contains non-contiguous rounds - can this cause misleading metrics? (Low)",
