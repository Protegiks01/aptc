  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: token_id] [Token name collision] Could identical token names in different collections cause event routing errors where cancel events are applied to the wrong token, enabling theft of similarly-named tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: amount] [Zero-amount exploit] Can zero-amount cancel offer events be emitted to flood event logs, bypass fee calculations, or exploit code paths that assume amount > 0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: amount] [MAX_U64 overflow] If amount is set to u64::MAX, can downstream arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication for fees) cause integer overflow leading to incorrect balance calculations or free token transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: amount] [Amount mismatch attack] Can an attacker emit a cancel event with an amount that doesn't match the actual offered amount on-chain, causing accounting discrepancies between event logs and blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: amount] [Fractional token exploit] For non-fungible tokens that should have amount=1, can fractional amounts (amount=0 or amount>1) be specified in cancel events to exploit logic that assumes NFTs are indivisible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: to_address] [Invalid address format] Does AccountAddress validation ensure the to_address is a valid 32-byte address, or can malformed addresses cause crashes when events are processed by the Move VM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: to_address] [Special address bypass] Can to_address be set to special system addresses (0x0 core resources, 0x1 framework, 0x3 token module) to bypass access controls or inject events into privileged accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: to_address] [Address collision attack] Could a vanity address collision allow an attacker to create a to_address that matches a legitimate user's first N bytes, enabling phishing attacks through event logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Field: to_address] [Burn address exploit] Can to_address point to known burn addresses (0x0000...0000) to create fake cancel events that manipulate token supply metrics without actually burning tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Event replay attack] Does the event structure include sufficient context (transaction hash, sequence number, timestamp) to prevent replay attacks where the same cancel event is processed multiple times across different blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Out-of-order processing] If cancel offer events are processed out of chronological order due to concurrent execution or reorganizations, could this allow double-cancellation exploits or race conditions in offer state management? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Cross-transaction consistency] Can an attacker emit cancel events in one transaction while simultaneously creating new offers in another, exploiting race conditions to cancel offers that should be immutable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Event ordering dependency] If TokenCancelOfferEvent must be processed after corresponding TokenOfferEvent but event processors don't enforce this ordering, could premature cancellations create orphaned offer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Indexer desync] Can discrepancies between how the Move VM emits events and how try_from_bytes() deserializes them cause indexers to have incorrect token offer state, enabling arbitrage or theft? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [API injection attack] When events are exposed via REST API, can special characters or escape sequences in TokenId fields break JSON encoding, causing API responses to inject malicious payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Cross-module event confusion] If multiple token standards (Token V1, Token V2, custom tokens) emit similarly-structured cancel events, could event processors mix them up leading to cross-standard token theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Gas metering bypass] Can emitting large numbers of TokenCancelOfferEvents with minimal on-chain state changes allow attackers to spam the event log while bypassing gas fees intended for storage operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Serialization format mismatch] Does the Serde Serialize implementation produce output compatible with Move's BCS format, or could format mismatches cause events to be rejected by validators while accepted by APIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Derive: Serialize] [Field ordering vulnerability] If Serde serializes fields in a different order than Move expects, could this cause signature verification failures or allow attackers to create events with swapped field meanings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Deserialization denial] Can malformed data with unexpected field counts, missing required fields, or extra fields cause panics in the Deserialize implementation rather than returning proper Result::Err? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leakage] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information (full token IDs, addresses) in log files that could be exploited for targeted attacks or privacy violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_cancel_offer_event.rs] [Struct: TokenCancelOfferEvent] [Move semantic violation] Does the event's memory layout match Move's expectations for alignment and padding, or could mismatches cause undefined behavior when crossing the Rust-Move FFI boundary?
