  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Struct: CachedModuleView] [State synchronization] The struct contains state_view, environment, and module_cache at lines 95-102 - can these three components get out of sync during epoch changes or reconfiguration, causing validators to use mismatched configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Struct: ModuleView] [Simple cache design] ModuleView uses a simple RefCell<HashMap> at line 35 without versioning - can this simpler design be vulnerable to cache poisoning that CachedModuleView would detect via versioning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Feature flag dependency] Lines 42-43 depend on Features config for deserializer_config - can malicious governance proposals modify Features to weaken deserialization security, allowing invalid bytecode to pass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [DeserializerConfig usage] The deserializer_config is passed to CompiledModule::deserialize_with_config at lines 43 and 71 - can attackers exploit specific config combinations to bypass bytecode validation or enable deprecated/unsafe deserialization features? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [StateKey construction] StateKey::module_id() is used at lines 62, 225, 289 - can module_id manipulation or collision attacks cause wrong state keys to be accessed, loading incorrect module bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Arc reference counting] Arc is used extensively for CompiledModule at lines 54, 80, 270 - can weak/strong reference imbalances cause modules to be prematurely deallocated while still in use, leading to use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Error Location] PartialVMError is finished with Location::Undefined at line 237 - does this lack of location information make it harder to debug validator disagreements or mask the source of errors in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Logging security] AdapterLogSchema at line 110 logs state_view.id() - can this leak sensitive information about validator state synchronization that could be used to time attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Module cache lifetime] The module_cache outlives individual state_views - can stale modules from old state_views be accessed after reset_state_view(), causing execution against wrong state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [NoOpLayoutCache trait] Line 162 implements NoOpLayoutCache for CachedModuleView - does this mean layout caching is disabled, potentially causing performance issues or repeated expensive layout computations that could be DoS vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [WithRuntimeEnvironment trait] Lines 164-168 provide access to RuntimeEnvironment - can callers mutate the environment in unsafe ways that affect module caching or execution semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Test coverage] The test module at lines 306-436 tests cache consistency but not security properties - are there missing tests for version rollback attacks, cache poisoning, deserialization exploits, or concurrent access races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Cross-validator consistency] If different validators have different module cache states due to race conditions or timing differences, can this cause them to execute transactions differently, leading to consensus failure and network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Module upgrade attacks] During on-chain module upgrades, can the cache staleness window be exploited where some validators execute old code and others execute new code for the same transaction, causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Epoch boundary bugs] At epoch boundaries when validator sets change, can the CachedModuleView state become corrupted if reset_all() or reset_state_view() is called at incorrect times, causing new validators to have invalid caches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Parallel execution safety] If Block-STM runs transactions in parallel, can concurrent access to ModuleView or CachedModuleView cause cache corruption, especially with RefCell which is not thread-safe? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Gas metering bypass] Since view_compiled_module() and related functions don't appear to charge gas, can attackers spam module loads to exhaust validator resources without paying sufficient gas fees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [State view timestamp] The state_view represents a point-in-time snapshot - can stale state_views combined with the cache cause validators to execute transactions with inconsistent views of module versions across different accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [AptosModuleExtension metadata] The AptosModuleExtension wraps StateValue at line 157 - can mismatches between extension metadata and actual CompiledModule cause the VM to make incorrect assumptions about module properties like gas costs or allowed operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Deserialization determinism] Multiple validators deserializing the same module bytecode must produce identical CompiledModule objects - can non-deterministic deserialization (e.g., HashMap iteration order) cause validators to disagree on module semantics? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Version monotonicity] The version tracking assumes versions increase monotonically - can version reuse after state pruning or version rollback during state sync cause validators to incorrectly cache old module versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Cache memory bounds] Neither ModuleView nor CachedModuleView implement cache size limits - can attackers deploy thousands of unique modules to exhaust validator memory, causing OOM crashes and network unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Builder pattern security] The ModuleCodeBuilder trait allows custom module building logic - can malicious trait implementations bypass security checks or inject malicious bytecode during the build process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-resource-viewer/src/module_view.rs] [Extension cloning] Arc<AptosModuleExtension> is cloned and shared - can the extension contain mutable state that causes shared mutability bugs when the same extension is used across multiple module instances? (Medium)",
