  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Operator Replacement Attack] Can an attacker replace a legitimate operator with a malicious one to redirect staking rewards, manipulate validator behavior, or censor transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the function verify the caller is the stake pool owner, or can any user call this to reassign operators on pools they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Pool Type Exploitation] The function uses different on-chain methods for Direct vs StakingContract vs Vesting pools - can pool type confusion cause operator changes to be applied to wrong pools? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Old Operator Manipulation] For StakingContract pools, the function references stake_pool.operator_address (old operator) - can this be manipulated to switch operators on unintended contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Vesting Contract Unwrap] When calling vesting_update_operator_with_same_commission with .unwrap(), can a None value cause panic, or can a malicious API return wrong vesting contract addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Commission Preservation] The functions explicitly maintain 'same_commission' - can this be exploited to avoid paying higher commissions or to lock in unfavorable commission rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Operator Self-Assignment] Can an attacker set themselves as operator of their own pool to gain unfair advantages in validator selection or reward distribution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Multi-Pool Race Condition] When changing operators across multiple pools, can race conditions cause some pools to update while others retain old operators, creating split control scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Invalid Operator Address] Can an attacker set operator_address to an invalid, non-existent, or system address to brick the stake pool or redirect operations to unintended accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetOperator::execute()] [Validator Set Manipulation] Can rapidly changing operators be used to manipulate the validator set or election process by confusing which operators are eligible for proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Governance Takeover] Can an attacker change the delegated voter to steal voting power and control governance decisions for stake pools they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Authorization Missing] Does the function verify the caller owns the stake pool before allowing voter changes, or can unauthorized users reassign voting rights? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Pool Type Confusion] Similar to SetOperator, can pool type misidentification cause voter changes to be applied to wrong pools or using incorrect on-chain functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Operator Address Injection] For StakingContract pools, does using stake_pool.operator_address allow injection of malicious operators to change voters on unintended contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Vesting Contract Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the vesting_update_voter call with manipulated vesting_contract addresses to redirect voting power from vesting stakes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Voter Centralization] Can an attacker set themselves as voter for multiple pools to centralize voting power and manipulate governance outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Vote Dilution Attack] Can an attacker change voters immediately before important governance votes to prevent legitimate voters from participating? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Invalid Voter Address] Can setting voter_address to invalid, system, or malicious addresses corrupt governance or prevent voting on critical proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Multi-Pool Inconsistency] When processing multiple pools, if voter changes succeed on some but fail on others, does this create exploitable voting power miscalculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: SetDelegatedVoter::execute()] [Front-Running Proposals] Can an attacker monitor the mempool for governance proposals and front-run them by changing voters to ensure their preferred vote outcome? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Commission Manipulation] Can an attacker set commission_percentage to 0 or 100 to unfairly distribute rewards or to drain all rewards from stakers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Pool Address Collision] Does default_stake_pool_address properly prevent collisions, or can an attacker create contracts with predictable addresses to hijack existing pools or interfere with others? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Amount Overflow] Can specifying u64::MAX for amount cause overflow in contract creation logic or corrupt the staking contract state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Operator Address Validation] Can invalid or malicious operator addresses be specified to create dysfunctional contracts that can't perform validator operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/stake/mod.rs] [Function: CreateStakingContract::execute()] [Voter Address Exploit] Similarly, can malicious voter addresses be set to control governance votes through newly created contracts? (High)"
