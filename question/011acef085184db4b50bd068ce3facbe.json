  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker set the NUM_THREADS environment variable to an extremely large value (e.g., 1000000) causing excessive thread allocation and system memory exhaustion when Builder::new_multi_thread().worker_threads(*NUM_THREADS) is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource exhaustion] Can the STACK_SIZE environment variable be set to an enormous value (e.g., 10GB per thread) in .thread_stack_size(*STACK_SIZE), causing memory exhaustion and system crash when combined with multiple threads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integer overflow] If NUM_THREADS is set to 0 via environment variable, does worker_threads(0) cause undefined behavior, panic, or create a runtime that cannot execute tasks, leading to silent test failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Stack exhaustion] Can STACK_SIZE be set to a very small value (e.g., 1024 bytes) causing immediate stack overflow when async tasks execute, masking real test failures with infrastructure crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration injection] Since NETWORK_NAME is read from environment variables, can an attacker inject invalid network names to cause test_flows to connect to malicious endpoints or cause panics in network_name parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error handling] Does the Builder::new_multi_thread().build()? call properly handle errors, or can runtime creation failures be masked by the ? operator, causing silent failures in test infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Metrics manipulation] Is MetricsPusher::start_for_local_run initialized before tests run, allowing metrics to be collected even if tests fail catastrophically, or can early failures prevent metrics reporting entirely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unsafe configuration] Does enable_all() enable potentially dangerous Tokio features (like I/O, timers) without validation, and could this interact poorly with malformed test configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Time manipulation] Can system time be manipulated (e.g., via NTP attacks or syscall interception) to generate colliding run_id values, causing metrics from different test runs to be mixed together and corrupting observability data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Run ID collision] If multiple instances start within the same second, they generate identical run_id values (SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)?.as_secs()), causing metric namespace collisions and incorrect test result reporting - is this handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Integer overflow] Can duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) overflow when converting to string on systems with unusual time representations, causing panics or incorrect run_id generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Error propagation] If SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) fails (e.g., system time before UNIX_EPOCH), does the ? operator properly propagate this error, or could it mask timing-related system failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Determinism] Does using Unix timestamp as run_id create any deterministic test execution patterns that could be exploited to predict or manipulate test outcomes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Race condition] Do the 5 concurrent test spawns (handle_newaccount, handle_cointransfer, handle_nfttransfer, handle_publishmodule, handle_viewfunction) share any mutable state that could cause data races despite Rust's borrow checker? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Resource contention] Can concurrent execution of all 5 test flows cause race conditions in accessing shared network resources (testnet/devnet APIs), leading to false test failures or throttling that masks real issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Task cancellation] If one test panics or times out, does join_all properly handle partial failures, or could it leave zombie tasks running that continue executing and corrupting subsequent test runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Clone safety] Each test receives run_id.clone() - if TestName::run modifies this string (despite &str), could there be unexpected sharing or mutation bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Spawn order dependency] Are the tests spawned in a specific order for a reason, and could reordering cause unexpected interactions (e.g., NewAccount before CoinTransfer)? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Concurrent metrics] Do the concurrent test flows write to shared metrics collectors, and could this cause race conditions in metric recording despite using Prometheus HistogramVec? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Test isolation] Does each TestName::run create isolated accounts and state, or could concurrent tests interfere with each other's on-chain state (e.g., account nonce conflicts)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [State pollution] If one test flow fails and leaves on-chain state in an inconsistent state, can it cause cascading failures in other concurrent flows sharing the same network? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Network state] Since all tests run against the same NETWORK_NAME, can concurrent execution cause unexpected on-chain state interactions that wouldn't occur in serial execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-api-tester/src/main.rs] [Function: test_flows()] [Cleanup] Does join_all ensure proper cleanup even if tests fail, or could failed tests leak resources (network connections, accounts, etc.)? (Low)",
