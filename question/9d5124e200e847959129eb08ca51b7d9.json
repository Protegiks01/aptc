  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_pre_committed_version] Can the pre-committed version diverge from synced version for extended periods, breaking assumptions in state sync or consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_epoch_ending_ledger_infos] Can requesting epoch ranges that span the current epoch boundary cause inconsistent views of validator set changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_transaction_by_hash] Since this is described as 'best-effort' without absence proof, can attackers exploit this to cause validators to make incorrect decisions based on missing transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: open_internal] Can the pruner config validation be bypassed by providing NO_OP_STORAGE_PRUNER_CONFIG on non-readonly instances, disabling safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: open_internal] If indexer initialization fails after databases are opened, are the databases properly closed, or does this leave file handles open causing resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: open_internal] Can malicious values for rocksdb_configs cause RocksDB to allocate excessive memory or create security vulnerabilities in the underlying storage engine? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: open_indexer] During indexer catch-up, can the batch processing of BATCH_SIZE=10000 transactions cause memory exhaustion if write sets are extremely large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: error_if_ledger_pruned] Can TOCTOU bugs between checking min_readable_version and actually reading data cause reads of already-pruned data leading to errors or corrupted state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: error_if_state_merkle_pruned] The function checks two different pruners (state_merkle_pruner and epoch_snapshot_pruner) - can inconsistencies between these checks cause some state to appear available when it's actually pruned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_raw_block_info_by_height] When skip_index_and_usage is true, fallback to metadata_db - can this return different results than event-based lookup, causing consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: gauged_api] The nested tracking with thread-local ENTERED_GAUGED_API - can recursive calls cause metrics to be under-reported, hiding performance issues or attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Function: open()] [Error Propagation] If database initialization fails midway, does the error handling properly clean up partial state, or can failed initialization attempts leave corrupted database files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Function: create_checkpoint()] [Error Recovery] If checkpoint creation fails due to disk full error, can subsequent checkpoint attempts succeed, or does the failure leave persistent corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Function: commit_genesis_ledger_info()] [Error Messages] Does the error message 'Genesis ledger info epoch is not 0' leak sensitive information about blockchain state that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Struct: AptosDB] [Debug Implementation] The Debug trait returns '{AptosDB}' without details - is this to prevent accidental logging of sensitive data, or could verbose debug output leak validator keys or state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: calculate_and_commit_ledger_and_state_kv] Multiple parallel spawns commit different databases - if one fails, are the others rolled back, or can partial commits cause state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: commit_state_kv_and_ledger_metadata] Writing to ledger_metadata_batch and sharded_state_kv_batches in parallel - can one succeed and the other fail, leaving inconsistent commit progress markers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: commit_transaction_accumulator] Can the gap between putting transaction accumulator and writing root hashes allow for inconsistent accumulator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: post_commit] If indexer.index() fails after ledger info is updated, can this cause the indexer to permanently fall behind and never catch up? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: check_and_put_ledger_info] Multiple validation checks before writing - can any of these checks be bypassed through race conditions or by providing specially crafted ledger info? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_and_check_commit_range] Can integer overflow occur when checking version ranges if version_to_commit is near u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Integration: get_and_check_commit_range] The checks ensure version_to_commit is between old_committed and pre_committed - can carefully timed commits violate this invariant during epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Struct: AptosDB] [Version Tracking] Three version concepts exist (synced, pre-committed, committed) - can inconsistencies between these cause validators to query wrong state versions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Function: open()] [Configuration Validation] Are the rocksdb_configs parameters validated, or can malicious values for shared_block_cache_size or background threads cause instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/mod.rs] [Function: open()] [Boolean Parameter] The readonly parameter - is it properly enforced throughout the codebase, or can readonly instances perform writes through unsafe code paths? (High)"
