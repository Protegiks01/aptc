  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: SignedBatchInfo::verify()] [Time Manipulation Attack] Can an attacker with control over system time (via NTP attacks) manipulate duration_since_epoch() to make expired batches appear valid or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: SignedBatchInfo::verify()] [Expiration Gap Overflow] Can extremely large max_batch_expiry_gap_usecs values cause integer overflow when added to current time, making all future batches appear invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: SignedBatchInfo::verify()] [Optimistic Verification Bypass] Does optimistic_verify provide the same security guarantees as full verification, or can attackers exploit the optimization to sneak in invalid signatures under certain conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: SignedBatchInfo::verify()] [Validator Set Race] If the validator set changes during verification (epoch transition), can optimistic_verify use stale validator keys leading to accepting signatures from removed validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: SignedBatchInfo::signature()] [Signature Extraction Race] Can concurrent calls to signature() and verify() lead to TOCTOU issues where a signature passes verification but is then replaced before use? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: From<SignedBatchInfo<BatchInfo>> for SignedBatchInfo<BatchInfoExt>] [Signature Reuse] When converting from BatchInfo to BatchInfoExt, the signature is reused without re-verification - can this allow signatures valid for V1 to be incorrectly accepted for V2? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: TryFrom<SignedBatchInfo<BatchInfoExt>> for SignedBatchInfo<BatchInfo>] [Downgrade Attack] Does the V1 type check properly prevent V2 batches from being downgraded, or can attackers strip encryption metadata by forcing this conversion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: TryFrom<SignedBatchInfo<BatchInfoExt>>] [Error Handling] If the ensure! check fails for non-V1 batches, does the calling code properly handle the error or could it lead to silent failures accepting invalid batches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStoreMsg::verify()] [Proof Limit DoS] Can an attacker send max_num_proofs proofs all requiring expensive verification to maximize CPU consumption per message? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStoreMsg::verify()] [Cache Poisoning] Does the ProofCache properly isolate entries by epoch/author, or can an attacker poison the cache with invalid proofs that match legitimate batch_info_ext keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStoreMsg::verify()] [Partial Verification] If early proofs verify but later ones fail, does the function ensure no state changes occurred from the partial success? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStoreMsg::epoch()] [Empty Proof Message] Can repeated empty proof messages trigger the ensure! check to cause error handling overhead as a DoS vector? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStoreMsg::epoch()] [Mixed Epoch Proofs] If proofs from different epochs are mixed, does this create consensus inconsistency or allow old proofs to be replayed in new epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::new()] [Unchecked Aggregation] Does new() validate that the AggregateSignature actually corresponds to the batch info, or can attackers create arbitrary ProofOfStore with mismatched signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Cache Hit Bypass] When cache.get() returns a matching signature, does this skip all validator checks allowing expired or Byzantine validator signatures if they were cached earlier? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Cache Key Collision] Can attackers create different BatchInfo objects that hash to the same BatchInfoExt cache key, causing signature verification to be skipped for invalid proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Cache Insertion Race] If verify() is called concurrently for the same batch, can race conditions in cache.insert() lead to invalid signatures being cached? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Signature Comparison Bypass] Does comparing cached signature == self.multi_signature use constant-time comparison, or can timing attacks leak information about signature differences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Validator Set Staleness] When verify_multi_signatures() is called, does it use the current validator set or could it use stale validator data from an old epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::verify()] [Failed Verification Caching] If verification fails, is there protection against caching the failed attempt and blocking future valid signatures for the same batch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::shuffled_signers()] [Randomness Predictability] Does thread_rng() provide cryptographically secure randomness, or can attackers predict the shuffle order to manipulate signer selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::shuffled_signers()] [Signer Set Manipulation] Can an attacker provide malformed ordered_authors to get_signers_addresses() to extract incorrect signer lists from the aggregate signature? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::shuffled_signers()] [Empty Signers Attack] If get_signers_addresses() returns an empty vector, does the shuffle operation handle this gracefully or could it cause issues in quorum counting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Function: ProofOfStore::shuffled_signers()] [Shuffle Bias] Can the random shuffle introduce bias in signer ordering that advantages certain validators in reward distribution or transaction ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/proof_of_store.rs] [Impl: Deref for ProofOfStore] [Transparent Access Security] Does the Deref implementation allowing transparent access to batch info bypass any security checks that should occur when accessing batch metadata? (Medium)"
