  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Type Safety] Can the empty struct definition lead to type confusion attacks where an attacker substitutes TransactionFeeBurnCap with another empty struct sharing the same memory layout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Memory Safety] Does the zero-sized type (ZST) nature of TransactionFeeBurnCap create any undefined behavior when used with unsafe code or FFI boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Serialization] Are there any serialization edge cases where BCS encoding/decoding of the empty struct could be exploited to inject malicious data or cause deserialization failures? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: TYPE_IDENTIFIER] [Type Confusion] Can manipulation of the TYPE_IDENTIFIER constant 'AptosCoinCapabilities' lead to type confusion where the wrong on-chain resource is fetched, potentially exposing privileged capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Deserialization] Does the default deserialize_into_config implementation properly validate the on-chain bytes before constructing TransactionFeeBurnCap, or can malformed data cause panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [State Key Generation] When StateKey::on_chain_config::<TransactionFeeBurnCap>() is called, can an attacker manipulate the generated key to point to a different on-chain resource and steal burn capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Cache Poisoning] If TransactionFeeBurnCap is cached by the system, can an attacker poison the cache with a malicious version to affect all subsequent transactions requiring fee burning? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Module Spoofing] Can an attacker create a malicious module with the same identifier 'transaction_fee' at a different address to spoof the legitimate module and intercept burn capability access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Path Traversal] Does the MODULE_IDENTIFIER 'transaction_fee' undergo proper validation to prevent path traversal or module namespace poisoning attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Unicode Exploitation] Can Unicode normalization or homoglyph attacks be used to create a visually identical but different MODULE_IDENTIFIER that bypasses security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: MODULE_IDENTIFIER] [Length Validation] Is there validation on the MODULE_IDENTIFIER length to prevent buffer overflow or excessive memory consumption during string operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: TYPE_IDENTIFIER] [Resource Substitution] Can an attacker exploit the TYPE_IDENTIFIER 'AptosCoinCapabilities' mapping to substitute the expected resource with a malicious one containing unrestricted burn capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: TYPE_IDENTIFIER] [Type Mismatch] If the on-chain Move struct 'AptosCoinCapabilities' is upgraded or modified, could a type mismatch between the Rust type and Move type lead to incorrect deserialization or privilege escalation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: TYPE_IDENTIFIER] [Struct Tag Collision] Can hash collisions or namespace conflicts with other structs named 'AptosCoinCapabilities' in different modules lead to fetching the wrong capability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: TYPE_IDENTIFIER] [Case Sensitivity] Are there case sensitivity issues with 'AptosCoinCapabilities' that could allow case variation attacks to bypass type checking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [BCS Malleability] Can BCS encoding malleability allow multiple different byte sequences to deserialize to the same TransactionFeeBurnCap, enabling signature or hash collision attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Double Deserialization] Does TransactionFeeBurnCap require double BCS deserialization (like other configs), and if not properly implemented, can this lead to accessing raw capability bytes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Partial Deserialization] Can partial or truncated BCS data cause the deserializer to accept incomplete TransactionFeeBurnCap data, leading to undefined state? (Medium)",
