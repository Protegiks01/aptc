  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Truncation batch size] When truncating, if StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema contains millions of entries to delete, does the truncation helper batch deletions to avoid memory exhaustion, or can unbounded batch growth cause OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Truncation ordering] Are StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema entries deleted before or after corresponding JellyfishMerkleNodes during truncation, and can incorrect ordering cause referential integrity violations or missing cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Partial truncation recovery] If truncation is interrupted mid-operation (e.g., validator crash), can the database be left in an inconsistent state where some StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema entries are deleted but others remain, requiring manual repair? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/test.rs] [Test coverage] [Encode-decode round-trip] Does the proptest in test_encode_decode adequately test edge cases like version=0, version=u64::MAX, and NodeKeys with maximum nibble path depth, or can corner cases slip through fuzzing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/test.rs] [Test coverage] [No-panic decoding] Does test_no_panic_decoding! test all possible malformed inputs including truncated keys, oversized keys, and keys with invalid version/node_key combinations, or can crafted database corruption still cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Integration test gaps] Are there comprehensive integration tests that verify correct interaction between StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema and epoch_snapshot_pruner under concurrent load, or can race conditions remain undetected until production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Upgrade test gaps] Are there tests that verify backward compatibility when upgrading from old versions that didn't have StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema, ensuring old databases can be migrated without data loss? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Performance regression tests] Are there benchmarks that detect performance degradation if StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema key encoding becomes inefficient, potentially catching issues before they affect mainnet? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema macro] [Column family name collision] Can the column family name STALE_NODE_INDEX_CROSS_EPOCH_CF_NAME collide with any other schema's column family name in RocksDB, potentially causing data corruption if two schemas try to use the same column family? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema macro] [Schema type safety] Does the define_schema! macro enforce type safety such that StaleNodeIndex keys can only be used with unit () values, or can type confusion allow incorrect value types to be written? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema macro] [Schema trait implementation] Are all required traits (KeyCodec, ValueCodec, SeekKeyCodec) correctly implemented for StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema, or can missing implementations cause runtime errors when the schema is used in unexpected contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_node_index_cross_epoch/mod.rs] [Schema integration] [Schema registry consistency] Is StaleNodeIndexCrossEpochSchema correctly registered in the database's schema registry and column family list, or can registration errors cause the schema to be inaccessible or misconfigured? (Medium)"
