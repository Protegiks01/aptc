  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Log file path injection] The validator.log path is constructed by joining test_dir - can directory traversal in test_dir cause logs to be written to sensitive locations, potentially overwriting system files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [HealthChecker trust] The HealthChecker implementations are trusted to correctly verify service readiness - if they have bugs or can be fooled, could malicious services pass health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [aptos_cached_packages integrity] The head_release_bundle is assumed to be trustworthy - can an attacker replace the cached packages with malicious Move code that gets deployed to the test node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Port exhaustion] Setting all ports to 0 relies on OS port allocation - can repeated node starts exhaust available ephemeral ports, causing binding failures and denial of service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Port collision] If multiple nodes are started simultaneously, can they race for the same OS-assigned ports, causing binding conflicts or service misbinding? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Port range limits] Does the OS port allocation respect any configured port ranges or firewall rules, or can it assign ports that violate security policies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Config clone divergence] The config is cloned for the thread - if the original config is modified after cloning but before thread execution, can this create inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Indexer config conflict] Forcibly enabling indexer_grpc and use_data_service_interface could conflict with other config settings - can this create invalid states that crash the node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: zero_all_ports()] [Network config validation] After zeroing ports, is the modified config re-validated, or can invalid network configurations slip through to node startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Use-after-move] The test_dir PathBuf is cloned and moved into the closure - are there any potential use-after-move bugs if the path is accessed in futures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Lifetime safety] The futures returned have lifetime 'use<>' - can this create lifetime issues if the caller doesn't properly manage the future lifetimes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Function: start_node()] [Unwrap safety] Multiple unwrap() calls throughout the code - has each been verified to be actually infallible, or could unexpected states cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Module: imports] [Dependency vulnerability] The file imports from multiple aptos crates - if any dependency has vulnerabilities (especially in config parsing or network handling), are they exploitable through this interface? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-workspace-server/src/services/node.rs] [Module: imports] [no_panic_println macro] The custom no_panic_println macro is used for output - if this macro has bugs or doesn't actually prevent panics, could attacker-controlled input cause crashes? (Low)"
