  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Code Generation] [Manual vs Generated] Is this file manually maintained or auto-generated? If manual, could human error lead to inconsistencies between constant definitions and array aggregations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Transaction Selection] [Bias] What criteria were used to select which mainnet transactions to import? Could selection bias cause important edge cases to be missed in testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Update Process] [Staleness] How often are the imported transactions updated from mainnet/testnet? Could stale test data fail to catch vulnerabilities introduced by recent protocol changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Lines 654-665] [Function Documentation] Why is get_transaction_name() only documented implicitly through naming? Could lack of documentation cause misuse in test code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Static Constants] [Thread Safety] Are the static byte array constants safely shareable across threads in parallel test execution, or could concurrent access cause data races? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Array Iteration] [Iterator Safety] If multiple threads iterate over the aggregated transaction arrays simultaneously, could iterator invalidation or race conditions occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Function: get_transaction_name()] [Lines 654-665] [Error Handling] What should calling code do when get_transaction_name() returns None? Could silent failures hide test bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Empty Transaction] [Lines 536-539] Is the IMPORTED_TESTNET_TXNS_3_EMPTY_TXN constant properly handled by test code to ensure empty transactions don't cause null pointer or division by zero errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Block Metadata] [Genesis Handling] Do genesis and block metadata transactions receive special handling in tests, or could they be processed as regular user transactions leading to incorrect indexer state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-test-transactions/src/json_transactions/generated_transactions.rs] [Validator Transactions] [Lines 547-550] Are validator transactions properly distinguished from user transactions to prevent privilege escalation in indexer permission models?
