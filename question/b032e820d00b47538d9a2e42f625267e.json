  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 96-99] [Version comparison bypass] Can an attacker craft a version string that tricks the version comparison logic into believing a malicious older version is actually newer, preventing security updates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Downgrade attack] If current_version is None, the system treats it as requiring an update - can this be exploited to force installation of outdated vulnerable versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 38-39] [Version format manipulation] The target_version has 'v' prefix stripped - can inconsistent prefix handling lead to version comparison errors that skip critical security updates? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [False negative updates] If the version extraction fails but doesn't error, could the system incorrectly report being up-to-date when actually running a compromised or outdated binary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Executable permissions] After downloading the binary, are execute permissions properly set, and can this be exploited to prevent legitimate usage while allowing malicious replacement? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_movefmt_path()] [Malicious PATH manipulation] If an attacker adds a malicious directory at the front of PATH containing a fake movefmt binary, will get_movefmt_path() return this malicious binary? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 128-136] [Path search order] The function checks FORMATTER_EXE_ENV, then additional_binaries_dir, then PATH - can this search order be exploited to prioritize attacker-controlled locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: FormatterUpdateTool] [repo_owner validation] Is the repo_owner parameter validated to prevent injection of special characters that could manipulate GitHub API calls or filesystem operations? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 28-33] [Default value security] The default values for repo_owner and repo_name are not cryptographically verified - if these defaults are changed in a malicious fork, would users notice? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 80-94] [Error message leakage] Do error messages from failed version checks or updates leak sensitive information about filesystem paths, usernames, or system configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [Panic on error] If the version parsing panics instead of returning an error, could this be exploited for denial of service by providing malformed version output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 84-86] [UTF-8 context error] The error context reveals that UTF-8 parsing failed - could this information be used by attackers to craft precise attacks against the version parsing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 12] [self_update crate security] Does the self_update crate have known vulnerabilities, and is it regularly audited for supply chain attacks or insecure download mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 56] [regex crate DoS] Could the use of regex::Regex without timeouts lead to ReDoS attacks if malicious version strings are processed? (Low)",
