  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Validation gap] [Missing bounds checks] Are there any bounds checks on coefficient values, expression depth, or buffer size that would prevent malicious inputs from causing resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Validation gap] [Expression validation] Does any code validate DynamicExpression trees for structural correctness (e.g., no infinite recursion, reasonable depth), or can malformed expressions cause validator failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-abstract-gas-usage/src/lib.rs] [Validation gap] [Parameter name validation] Are gas parameter names validated/sanitized, or can special characters, very long names, or control characters cause issues in BTreeMap operations or downstream processing? (Medium)"
