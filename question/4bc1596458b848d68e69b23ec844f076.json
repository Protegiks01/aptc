  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Complexity attack] Are Fq12 operations significantly more expensive than Fr operations, and can an attacker exploit this to cause disproportionate resource consumption for the same gas cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Line 28] [Assertion failure] Does the assert_eq!(1, ty_args.len()) properly prevent attacks, or can it be optimized away in release builds leaving the function vulnerable to wrong argument counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Line 29] [Type extraction] Can the type_to_type_tag conversion in structure_from_ty_arg! fail or panic for malformed types, causing DoS instead of graceful error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Lines 60-66] [Semantic confusion] Why does BLS12381Gt use div operation with Fq12 type instead of proper Gt group subtraction - is this a deliberate design choice or a potential bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Lines 95-101] [Semantic confusion] Why does BN254Gt also use div operation with Fq12 - if both Gt implementations use division, can Move contracts incorrectly assume additive group semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Line 102-105] [Default case] Does the catch-all pattern at line 102 properly handle all unimplemented Structure variants, or can future additions to the Structure enum bypass this check? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Operation chaining] If sub_internal() is called repeatedly in a chain (a - b - c - ...), can accumulated floating-point errors or coordinate system changes cause the final result to diverge from the mathematically correct value? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Mixed operations] Can combining sub_internal() with add_internal(), mul_internal(), and other algebra operations in complex expressions cause intermediate results to have incompatible representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Inverse operations] If an attacker computes X = A - B and then Y = X + B, is Y guaranteed to equal A exactly, or can coordinate normalization prevent proper round-tripping? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Handle leak] Does sub_internal() properly increment the reference count when creating new elements, or can handles become invalid if the underlying Rc is deallocated prematurely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Handle cleanup] When SessionListener::start() clears AlgebraContext at the beginning of a new session, are all Rc references properly released, or can circular references prevent cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Handle overflow] If AlgebraContext.objs vector grows to hold thousands of elements, can the handle value (Vec::len()) overflow u64 or usize on certain platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/sub.rs] [Function: sub_internal()] [Unsafe operations] Does arkworks library use unsafe code internally for performance, and can specific input combinations trigger undefined behavior in those unsafe blocks?
