  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_runtime()] [Initialization race condition] Can a malicious actor exploit the timing window between consensus runtime creation and admin_service.set_consensus_dbs() to corrupt the consensus database references, potentially causing validator state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-node/src/consensus.rs] [Function: create_consensus_runtime()] [Missing validation] Does the function validate that consensus_reconfig_subscription is properly initialized before passing it to start_consensus_runtime(), or can a None value cause consensus to miss critical epoch transitions leading to validator set desynchronization?
