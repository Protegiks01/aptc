  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_resource_groups()] [Dummy field bypass] The dummy_field check at lines 425-432 only verifies field name - can attackers add additional fields with names starting with '_' or using Unicode to smuggle data into resource group containers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_resource_groups()] [Ability set bypass] Line 441 checks for AbilitySet::EMPTY - can type system bugs allow phantom abilities or derived abilities that don't show up in this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_resource_groups()] [Type parameter smuggling] The check at line 449 prevents explicit type parameters - can attackers use implicit type parameters from trait bounds or associated types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_resource_group()] [Scope parsing vulnerability] At line 483, str::parse is used for scope validation - does this properly sanitize input, or can malicious scope strings cause parsing errors that are silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_resource_group()] [Attribute count bypass] Line 458 requires exactly 1 parameter - can attackers encode multiple parameters in a single attribute value using special delimiters or escape sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_unbiasabale_entry_functions()] [Typo exploitation] The function name has a typo ('unbiasabale' vs 'unbiasable') - could this indicate rushed code with other validation bugs that attackers could exploit? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_unbiasabale_entry_functions()] [Visibility bypass] The check at line 525 requires non-public entry functions - can attackers use friend visibility or module-private visibility tricks to bypass this while remaining externally callable? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_and_record_unbiasabale_entry_functions()] [Error continuation] When get_randomness_max_gas_declaration returns an error at line 515, execution continues - can attackers exploit this to deploy randomness functions without proper gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Multiple attribute bypass] Line 555 checks for >=2 sub-attributes but doesn't prevent exactly 0 sub-attributes - can attackers deploy randomness functions without any gas declaration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Key name spoofing] The key check at line 567 compares against RANDOMNESS_MAX_GAS_CLAIM - can Unicode normalization issues or homoglyphs allow 'max_gas' to be spoofed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Integer overflow in gas] At lines 585-589, to_u64_digits() is checked for length >=2, but can attackers exploit BigInt to u64 conversion to set gas limits higher than u64::MAX through wraparound? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Negative gas bypass] The check at line 581 uses abs() comparison - if a negative number has the same absolute value, does it pass validation but cause underflow in gas accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Zero gas exploitation] Line 591 allows max_gas of 0 as a valid value - can attackers deploy randomness entry functions with zero gas that cause validation errors or DoS during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: get_randomness_max_gas_declaration()] [Default annotation abuse] Line 595 returns a default RandomnessAnnotation - what is the default max_gas value, and can attackers exploit functions with default gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_unsafe_randomness_usage()] [Cache poisoning] The randomness_caller_cache at line 652 is shared across all functions - can attackers exploit cache state from prior validations to bypass randomness checks in subsequent modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_unsafe_randomness_usage()] [Entry function bypass] Line 616 only checks non-public entry functions - can attackers create public entry functions that call randomness, then make them non-entry afterward? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_unsafe_randomness_usage()] [Framework function exemption] The check at line 628 exempts framework functions from randomness validation - can attackers deploy malicious code at address 0x1 to bypass all randomness checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: check_unsafe_randomness_usage()] [Attribute bypass vulnerability] Line 630 checks for ALLOW_UNSAFE_RANDOMNESS_ATTRIBUTE - can attackers add this attribute to any public function to expose randomness features without restriction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: calls_randomness()] [Infinite recursion DoS] The recursive call at line 664 could cause stack overflow with mutually recursive functions - is there a depth limit to prevent DoS attacks during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/extended_checks.rs] [Function: calls_randomness()] [Cycle detection bypass] Line 656 sets cache to false initially for cycle handling - can attackers exploit the fixpoint algorithm with specific call graphs to hide randomness calls? (High)",
