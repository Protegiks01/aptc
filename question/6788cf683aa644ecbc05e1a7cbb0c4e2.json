  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: new()] [Type confusion] The constructor accepts Option<usize> for data_service_response_channel_size but uses unwrap_or_else - can an attacker exploit integer overflow by providing extremely large channel sizes that cause memory allocation failures or wrap-around behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Struct: NonTlsConfig] [Unencrypted exposure] The NonTlsConfig allows running without TLS encryption - can an attacker exploit deployments that only use non-TLS to intercept all indexer data in transit, including potentially sensitive transaction information, user addresses, and contract interactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Field: data_service_grpc_listen_address] [Bind to all interfaces] If SocketAddr is configured as 0.0.0.0:port, can an attacker connect from untrusted networks to access the indexer service, potentially bypassing firewall rules or network segmentation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: validate()] [Dual stack confusion] If both TLS and non-TLS configs bind to the same port on different interfaces, can this cause port conflict errors that aren't caught by validation, leading to service startup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Struct: TlsConfig] [IPv6 handling] The SocketAddr type supports IPv6, but is IPv6 properly handled in TLS certificate validation - can an attacker exploit IPv6 address handling to bypass certificate hostname verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Error message leakage] The code uses anyhow::anyhow! and ? operator for error propagation - can an attacker trigger specific error conditions that leak sensitive information about internal paths, Redis credentials, or system configuration through error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Println debugging] At lines 162-164, 169, 178, and 192, println! is used for logging instead of proper logging framework - can an attacker exploit these debug outputs to fill disk space with logs or extract timing information for side-channel attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Redis connection error exposure] At line 166, the Redis address is printed directly with println! - can an attacker capture logs to extract the Redis connection string, potentially including authentication credentials if they're embedded in the URL? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: validate()] [Validation bypass through errors] The validate() function uses bail! macro - can an attacker craft configurations that cause validate() to return Ok() even when critical security properties aren't met, by exploiting error handling edge cases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_CHANNEL_SIZE] [Channel size underflow] The default channel size is 3, but can an attacker configure a channel size of 0 or usize::MAX through configuration, causing either immediate deadlock (size 0) or memory exhaustion (size MAX)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Field: data_service_response_channel_size] [Arithmetic overflow] If the channel size is used in arithmetic operations elsewhere, can an attacker provide values near usize::MAX that cause overflow when multiplied by buffer sizes or element counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Tokio spawn limits] Multiple tokio::spawn calls at lines 204 and 224 - can an attacker exploit Tokio runtime limits by causing many server tasks to spawn, exhausting the async runtime's resources and preventing other critical tasks from running? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Async drop safety] The spawned tasks hold references to config - can dropping the config while tasks are running cause use-after-free bugs or undefined behavior if the tasks try to access moved data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Await ordering] At line 237, try_join_all awaits all server tasks - can an attacker exploit the ordering guarantees (or lack thereof) to cause servers to start in a specific order that creates security vulnerabilities, like TLS starting before certificate validation completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Derive: Clone on IndexerGrpcDataServiceConfig] [Deep clone vulnerability] The config struct derives Clone - can cloning the config with large txns_to_strip_filter or file_store_config cause memory exhaustion, or can cloned configs share references that lead to race conditions when modified? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Derive: Clone on TlsConfig] [Credential leakage through clone] TLS config containing cert_path and key_path derives Clone - can cloning spread certificate paths throughout the codebase, increasing the attack surface for path traversal or making secure credential rotation more difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Async file read safety] At lines 217-218, certificate files are read with tokio::fs::read - can an attacker exploit the async nature to cause race conditions if files are modified during the read operation, potentially loading partial or corrupted certificate data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [File size limits] There are no size limits on certificate file reads - can an attacker provide a path to an extremely large file that causes memory exhaustion when the entire file is read into memory as cert/key byte arrays? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [File existence check] The code directly reads cert/key files without checking if they exist first - can an attacker cause information disclosure by triggering file-not-found errors that reveal file system structure or path information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [File descriptor consistency] Three separate file descriptor sets are registered (INDEXER_V1, TRANSACTION_V1_TESTING, UTIL_TIMESTAMP) - can an attacker exploit version mismatches or incompatibilities between these descriptors to cause reflection to return invalid schemas that lead to parsing errors or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Reflection build failure] The reflection service build can fail at line 151, but this error is caught and converted to anyhow - can an attacker cause specific conditions that make reflection builds fail repeatedly, preventing service startup or causing error message disclosure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Compression algorithm selection] Both Zstd and Gzip compression are accepted/sent - can an attacker force the use of weaker Gzip compression over stronger Zstd by manipulating request headers, potentially enabling compression-based side-channel attacks or reducing performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Decompression bomb via gRPC] The service accepts compressed requests - can an attacker send highly compressed malicious requests that expand to enormous size during decompression, causing memory exhaustion or CPU DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Constant: SERVER_NAME] [Server identification] The SERVER_NAME constant 'idxdatasvc' is exposed via get_server_name() - can an attacker use this identifier to fingerprint the service version or detect specific deployments for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/config.rs] [Function: run()] [Server builder configuration] The Server::builder() is called without explicit concurrency limits, connection limits, or rate limiting - can an attacker exploit unlimited connection acceptance to exhaust server resources and cause denial of service?
