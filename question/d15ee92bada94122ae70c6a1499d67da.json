  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Concurrency] [Lock ordering] If RegisteredReadDependencies is used with other locks in Block-STM, could incorrect lock ordering cause deadlocks between dependency tracking and transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Concurrency] [Spurious wakeup] Does code using Mutex<RegisteredReadDependencies> properly handle spurious wakeups, or could this cause threads to observe inconsistent dependency state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [DoS] [Algorithmic complexity] Could an attacker craft a transaction sequence that causes extend_impl() to perform O(n²) operations due to BTreeMap rebalancing, slowing down Block-STM execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [DoS] [Memory pressure] Can an attacker cause dependencies to grow unbounded by creating transactions that read from many other transactions, eventually causing OOM and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [DoS] [Lock contention] Could high contention on the Mutex in take_dependencies() cause Block-STM threads to spend most of their time waiting, reducing throughput and causing consensus timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Arithmetic] [Comparison overflow] At line 17, could the comparison *lowest_dep_idx <= txn_idx overflow if both values are near integer boundaries, causing incorrect validation results? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Invariant] [Monotonicity enforcement] The insert() function assumes monotonic incarnations (line 60), but is this enforced elsewhere, or could a bug in transaction re-execution break this assumption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Invariant] [Ordering preservation] Does the BTreeMap's ordering guarantee hold across all operations, or could rebalancing cause temporary ordering violations visible to concurrent readers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Invariant] [Completeness] Are all read dependencies guaranteed to be recorded in RegisteredReadDependencies, or could cache effects cause some dependencies to be missed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Testing] [Concurrent testing] The tests at lines 140-277 are single-threaded - could race conditions exist in production that aren't caught by these tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Testing] [Boundary testing] Are extreme values (0, MAX, MIN+1, MAX-1) for TxnIndex and Incarnation tested, or could boundary bugs exist in production? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Function: extend_impl()] [Entry API safety] At line 80, does the Entry API guarantee that Entry::Occupied and Entry::Vacant are mutually exclusive, or could a race cause both branches to execute? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Function: check_lowest_dependency_idx()] [First key efficiency] Does first_key_value() at line 16 operate in O(1) time for BTreeMap, or could it be O(log n), making repeated calls a performance bottleneck? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Function: split_off()] [Ownership transfer] After split_off() transfers ownership of entries to the returned BTreeMap, could the original BTreeMap still contain dangling references to those entries? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-move/mvhashmap/src/registered_dependencies.rs] [Function: extend()] [Commutativity] If extend(A) then extend(B) is called versus extend(B) then extend(A), could the final state differ due to non-commutative merging logic? (High)",
