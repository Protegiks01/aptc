(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/options.rs] [Function: set_experiment (line 152)] [Partial Configuration] If compilation fails between set_* method calls, can this leave the Options struct in an inconsistent state that affects subsequent compilations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/options.rs] [Field: testing (line 70)] [Stable Output Abuse] The testing flag ensures stable output for baseline testing - can an attacker enable this to disable ASLR, randomization, or other security features that depend on non-deterministic output?
