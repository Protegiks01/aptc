  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: try_from() for PrivateKey] [Map_err correctness] Does map_err properly convert all possible error types, or could unexpected errors propagate as panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: try_from() for PublicKey] [Error conversion] The error conversion from try_into() to WrongLengthError - could this hide underlying issues with the input data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: CryptoMaterialError] [Error information] Do the generic CryptoMaterialError types (DeserializationError, WrongLengthError) provide enough information for debugging without leaking sensitive details? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Missing key confirmation] The Diffie-Hellman operation returns raw bytes without any key confirmation - could this enable unknown key-share attacks where an attacker tricks validators into using compromised shared secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [No KDF] The function returns raw Diffie-Hellman output without key derivation - if used directly as an encryption key, could this weaken the cryptographic protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Identity verification] There's no built-in method to verify if a PublicKey belongs to a specific validator - could this enable man-in-the-middle attacks if public keys are not properly authenticated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: generate()] [Key commitment] Generated keys have no binding to validator identity - could an attacker generate valid-looking keys and impersonate validators in network handshakes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PrivateKey] [Backup/recovery] The module has no key backup or recovery mechanisms - if a validator loses their X25519 private key, could this permanently break their ability to participate in secure network communications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Module design] [Key rotation] There's no built-in support for key rotation - if a validator's X25519 key is compromised, could they continue to participate in the network with a new key without protocol disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Module design] [Forward secrecy] Static X25519 keys don't provide forward secrecy - if a validator's private key is compromised, can all past communications encrypted with this key be decrypted by an attacker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_private_bytes()] [Cross-protocol key reuse] Despite warnings, could validators accidentally reuse Ed25519 signing keys for X25519 key exchange, enabling cross-protocol attacks where Ed25519 signatures leak information about X25519 shared secrets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Public key correlation] Converting Ed25519 public keys to X25519 creates a deterministic mapping - could an attacker correlate validator signing keys with their network encryption keys to deanonymize traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_private_bytes()] [XEdDSA vulnerability] The XEdDSA conversion approach has specific security properties - does the implementation properly follow XEdDSA specifications, or could deviations introduce vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Montgomery ladder attacks] The conversion to Montgomery coordinates could expose the implementation to Montgomery ladder attacks - are there any side-channels in this conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Byzantine validator key exchange] If a Byzantine validator provides a malicious X25519 public key to honest validators, could they force weak shared secrets that enable eavesdropping on consensus messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Validator key substitution] Could a Byzantine validator substitute another validator's X25519 public key in network announcements, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on validator-to-validator communications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: generate()] [Validator key uniqueness] Does the system enforce that each validator generates a unique X25519 key, or could two validators accidentally use the same key, breaking confidentiality assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Module design] [Validator key distribution] How are validator X25519 public keys distributed securely - could an attacker intercept and modify public keys during validator onboarding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Consensus message encryption] If X25519 is used to encrypt consensus messages, could weak shared secrets or protocol flaws enable an attacker to decrypt block proposals and manipulate consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from()] [All-zero private key] What happens if a PrivateKey is constructed from all-zero bytes - is this a valid key, or should it be rejected as it may have special cryptographic properties? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from()] [All-one private key] Similarly, what about all-ones (0xFF...FF) bytes - could this create a weak key or have special properties in X25519? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [All-zero public key] The Default trait creates an all-zero PublicKey - if this is used in production, could it lead to predictable or zero shared secrets? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Maximum value inputs] What happens if remote_public_key has maximum byte values (0xFF...FF) - could this cause overflow or unexpected behavior in the Diffie-Hellman computation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_private_bytes()] [Empty input] What if from_ed25519_private_bytes() receives an empty slice - does it safely return an error or could it cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Boundary length] The function checks for exactly 32 bytes, but what about 31 or 33 bytes - are boundary conditions handled correctly? (Low)"
