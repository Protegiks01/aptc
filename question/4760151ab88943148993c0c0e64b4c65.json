  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Missing validation] There is no validation that the extracted type name meets requirements for use in API responses, database keys, or logs - could this lack of defensive programming allow future bugs when new Checker implementations are added? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Fallback clarity] The unwrap_or('UnknownType') fallback doesn't log or signal when it's triggered - could silent fallback to 'UnknownType' hide serious type system issues during development or testing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Tight coupling] The function creates tight coupling between Rust's type system and the node-checker's external API - if Rust's type name format changes or the API schema evolves, could this coupling cause widespread breakage across the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Provider macro dependency] Both Checker trait and get_provider! macro depend on get_type_name - if this function's behavior changes, could it have cascading effects breaking both checker result attribution and provider error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [API schema assumptions] The function assumes that any string is valid for CheckResult.checker_name, but does the poem_openapi schema enforce any constraints (length, charset, format) that could be violated by certain type names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Test coverage] Are there unit tests verifying get_type_name behavior with edge cases like empty types, Unicode, complex generics, and nested modules, or could untested edge cases cause production failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Integration testing] Are there integration tests ensuring that checker_name values extracted by get_type_name are correctly serialized, transmitted over the API, and consumed by clients without corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Fuzzing] Has the function been fuzz-tested with randomly generated type names or malicious type name patterns to identify potential crashes, panics, or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Data leakage] Could type names from internal or private Checker implementations leak sensitive information about Aptos infrastructure, deployment architecture, or security measures through the public API? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/helpers.rs] [Function: get_type_name()] [Audit trail] If node-checker results are used for compliance or audit purposes, does the lack of validation and versioning for checker_name values create issues for regulatory requirements around data integrity and traceability? (Low)"
