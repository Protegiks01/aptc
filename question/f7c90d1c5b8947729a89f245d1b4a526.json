  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request detail exposure] On line 84, the full request object is logged with .request(&request) - does this expose sensitive monitoring data like validator distances or peer connection details to unauthorized log readers? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Network client trust] On lines 41-48, send_to_peer_rpc is called without validating the network_client's state - can a compromised or uninitialized network_client cause undefined behavior or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: get_peers_and_metadata()] [Metadata exposure] On line 64, get_peers_and_metadata() returns an Arc<PeersAndMetadata> - can concurrent access to this shared metadata cause race conditions or expose inconsistent peer state during updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: get_peers_and_metadata()] [Metadata tampering] Does the returned Arc<PeersAndMetadata> on line 64 provide mutable access, allowing callers to modify peer metadata and corrupt the monitoring state across all clients sharing this Arc? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceClient] [Generic parameter trust] The generic NetworkClient parameter on line 27 could be any type implementing NetworkClientInterface - can a malicious implementation subvert security checks or inject responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Async cancellation safety] The async function on line 35 contains a network call on lines 41-48 - if the future is cancelled mid-flight, does this leave the network client in an inconsistent state or leak connection resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Async error handling] On lines 93-98, the await on send_request could be interrupted - is there proper cleanup if the task is aborted, or can this cause orphaned network connections? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Concurrent request correlation] If multiple tasks call send_request_to_peer() with the same peer_network_id concurrently, can request_id collisions or response mismatching occur due to lack of synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Response deserialization] When matching on response (line 50), is the deserialization of PeerMonitoringServiceMessage secure, or can crafted responses cause panic during pattern matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Response size validation] Is there validation that responses from send_to_peer_rpc (lines 41-49) don't exceed maximum size limits, or can malicious peers send huge responses causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Nested error handling] On line 52, PeerMonitoringServiceResponse contains Result<...> - can double-wrapping of errors cause confusion between network-level and service-level errors, hiding security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Match exhaustiveness] The match statement on lines 50-59 covers all PeerMonitoringServiceMessage variants, but if new variants are added in the future, will the compiler catch missing cases or could this introduce security holes? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Error variant bypass] On line 52, errors are wrapped in PeerMonitoringServiceError - can a malicious server craft specific error variants that bypass client-side validation or trigger unexpected code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: new()] [Unvalidated initialization] On lines 30-32, the constructor accepts any NetworkClient without validation - can an attacker pass a malicious or misconfigured network_client that compromises security throughout the client's lifetime? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceClient] [Clone semantics] The struct derives Clone on line 22 - when cloned, does this create independent clients or share the network_client, and can this lead to use-after-free or double-free issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Struct: PeerMonitoringServiceClient] [Debug trait exposure] The struct derives Debug on line 22 - does this expose sensitive network client internals when logged, potentially leaking connection details or cryptographic material? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Request validation] On line 38, the request parameter is accepted without validation - can an attacker pass malformed PeerMonitoringServiceRequest structures that cause downstream parsing errors or security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Request type checking] Does the function validate that the request type is appropriate for the target peer's capabilities, or can sending GetNetworkInformation to a non-validator cause information leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Message wrapping] On line 44, the request is wrapped in PeerMonitoringServiceMessage::Request - is there validation that this wrapping is reversible, or can message corruption during transit cause permanent request loss? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Protocol version mismatch] Does the client check that the server's protocol version is compatible before sending requests, or can version mismatches cause silent failures or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request()] [Result unwrapping] The function returns Result<PeerMonitoringServiceResponse, Error> - do all callers properly handle errors, or can ignored errors lead to incorrect assumptions about peer state? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [Error propagation path] Errors are propagated through multiple layers (lines 116-131) - can error transformation during propagation lose critical security context needed for incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/network.rs] [Function: send_request_to_peer()] [LatencyPing counter validation] When sending LatencyPing requests, is the ping_counter validated to detect manipulation, or can an attacker send responses with incorrect counters to falsify latency measurements? (Medium)",
