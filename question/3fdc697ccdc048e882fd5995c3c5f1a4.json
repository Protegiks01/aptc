  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/annotations.rs] [Function: Data::clone()] [Exponential cloning] Can deeply nested or recursive annotation types cause exponential time/space complexity during cloning, allowing DoS attacks on verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/annotations.rs] [Struct: Annotations] [Hash collision DoS] Can an attacker craft types with malicious Hash implementations to cause pathological BTreeMap performance, slowing verification to a crawl? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/annotations.rs] [Struct: Annotations] [Cross-phase contamination] Can annotations from early verification phases leak into later phases, causing phase-dependent checks to be bypassed by carrying forward invalid assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/annotations.rs] [Function: clear()] [Pipeline reset] Does clearing annotations between verification stages properly reset all state, or can residual information from previous bytecode poison subsequent verifications? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/annotations.rs] [Function: set()] [Self-referential types] Can self-referential types be stored in annotations, and if so, does this cause memory safety issues during cloning or dropping? (High)",
