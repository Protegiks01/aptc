  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TCPBufferCfg] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow or memory exhaustion by providing extremely large buffer size values (u32::MAX) in inbound_rx_buffer_bytes, inbound_tx_buffer_bytes, outbound_rx_buffer_bytes, or outbound_tx_buffer_bytes fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TCPBufferCfg] [Resource exhaustion] Can a malicious validator configure asymmetric buffer sizes (e.g., 1-byte RX buffer, 4GB TX buffer) to create memory pressure or cause denial-of-service conditions on peer nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: new_configs()] [Validation bypass] Does new_configs() validate that buffer sizes are within reasonable bounds, or can an attacker set buffer sizes to zero causing connection failures or to MAX values causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TCPBufferCfg] [Configuration tampering] Can buffer configuration be modified after initialization to downgrade security properties or cause resource starvation attacks against honest validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TcpTransport] [TTL manipulation] Can a malicious node set TTL to 1 to prevent packets from reaching validators beyond a single hop, effectively partitioning the network or causing liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TcpTransport] [Performance degradation] Can disabling TCP_NODELAY (setting nodelay to false) introduce latency attacks where consensus messages are delayed due to Nagle's algorithm, affecting block proposal and voting timings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Struct: TcpTransport] [Default configuration] Does the default configuration for TcpTransport use secure defaults for TTL and nodelay, or can the absence of explicit configuration lead to suboptimal security or performance characteristics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: set_tcp_buffers()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to set_tcp_buffers() from multiple threads cause race conditions where buffer configuration is partially updated, leading to inconsistent network behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: apply_config()] [Error handling] Does apply_config() properly handle errors from set_ttl() and set_nodelay(), or can a failure to apply configuration silently succeed, leading to connections with unexpected security properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: apply_config()] [Partial configuration] If set_ttl() succeeds but set_nodelay() fails, does the socket remain in a partially configured state that could be exploited for timing attacks or performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: apply_config()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability where configuration is validated but socket options are modified between validation and actual connection establishment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Address validation bypass] Can an attacker provide a NetworkAddress with extra protocol suffixes after the TCP address that passes parse_ip_tcp() but causes issues later, potentially bypassing address filtering or allowlist checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Port exhaustion] Does listen_on() validate that the requested port is not a privileged port (<1024) or system port, potentially allowing unauthorized binding to critical services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Backlog size] Is the hardcoded backlog size of 256 in socket.listen(256) sufficient to prevent connection flooding attacks where an attacker rapidly opens connections to exhaust the accept queue? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [IPv4/IPv6 confusion] Can an attacker exploit the IPv4 vs IPv6 socket creation logic to cause binding failures or create sockets that don't match the expected address family, leading to connection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [SO_REUSEADDR abuse] Does setting socket.set_reuseaddr(true) create a security risk where multiple processes can bind to the same port, potentially allowing a malicious process to hijack validator connections? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Buffer size validation] Are inbound_rx_buffer_bytes and inbound_tx_buffer_bytes validated before being passed to set_recv_buffer_size() and set_send_buffer_size(), or can zero or excessively large values cause kernel-level issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Address spoofing] After binding, does the code verify that listener.local_addr() matches the requested address, or can there be a mismatch that causes confusion about which interface is actually listening? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: listen_on()] [Error information leak] Do error messages from invalid_addr_error() leak sensitive information about network topology or configuration that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [Peer ID validation] Is the peer_id parameter actually validated and used for security checks, or is it ignored, allowing connections to unauthorized peers or man-in-the-middle attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [Address parsing inconsistency] Can an attacker provide a NetworkAddress that passes both parse_ip_tcp() and parse_dns_tcp() checks, causing ambiguous routing or connection to unintended destinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [Proxy injection] Can a malicious network environment inject HTTPS_PROXY environment variables through the Proxy::new() call, causing validators to route sensitive consensus traffic through attacker-controlled proxies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [URL parsing vulnerability] Is the Url::parse() call for proxy addresses vulnerable to parser differentials where malformed URLs could bypass security checks or cause unexpected routing behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [Scheme validation] Does the proxy URL scheme validation properly reject non-HTTP schemes, or can attackers specify 'https://', 'socks5://', or other schemes to bypass proxy restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/netcore/src/transport/tcp.rs] [Function: dial()] [Host validation] Does the proxy URL host validation check for localhost, private IPs, or cloud metadata endpoints that could be exploited for SSRF attacks against the validator infrastructure? (High)"
