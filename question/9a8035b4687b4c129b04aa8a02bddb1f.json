  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Struct: Viewer] [Debug trait] The Debug trait implementation could leak sensitive source code or bytecode content in debug logs - is this a concern for proprietary Move modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Struct: Viewer] [Generic constraints] The generic parameters require LeftScreen and RightScreen traits - can incompatible implementations cause type confusion or incorrect behavior during viewer initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Struct: Viewer] [Lifetime issues] The bytecode_text field stores owned Strings - can long-lived Viewer instances hold stale bytecode data that no longer matches the current module state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Trait: TUIInterface] [Const strings] The LEFT_TITLE and RIGHT_TITLE are static strings - can these be exploited to inject terminal escape sequences if displayed without sanitization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Trait: TUIInterface] [Interface contract] Does TUIInterface guarantee that bound_line() and bound_column() are called before on_redraw(), or can incorrect call ordering cause the panics and out-of-bounds accesses mentioned earlier? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Cross-function] [Initialization order] If on_redraw() is called before bound_line() and bound_column() validate the coordinates, can invalid line_number and column_number values cause panics or out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Cross-function] [State consistency] Since bytecode_text is initialized in new() by splitting backing_string(), can the backing string change between new() and subsequent on_redraw() calls, causing inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Cross-function] [Concurrent access] The Viewer struct doesn't implement Send/Sync explicitly - can multiple threads access the same Viewer instance causing data races in bytecode_text access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Malicious bytecode] Can an attacker compile Move code with malicious bytecode that exploits parsing bugs in backing_string(), causing incorrect line splits or buffer overflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Source map manipulation] Can manipulated source maps cause get_source_index_for_line() to return indices that point to wrong source locations, potentially hiding malicious code during auditing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [File path traversal] Does source_for_code_location() validate file paths, or can crafted bytecode info cause the viewer to display arbitrary files on the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Terminal injection] Can special characters in bytecode or source code (e.g., terminal escape sequences) break out of the TUI and execute commands in the user's terminal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Information disclosure] Can the viewer be tricked into displaying source code from modules that the user shouldn't have access to, bypassing access control checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Denial of service] Can specially crafted bytecode cause the viewer to enter infinite loops or hang indefinitely during rendering operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Overall] [Memory leaks] Do the Clone operations and string allocations properly clean up memory, or can repeated viewer operations cause memory leaks over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 32] [String splitting] Does split('\\\\n') handle files with no newlines correctly, or will it return unexpected results for single-line bytecode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 33] [Map closure] The map(|x| x.to_string()) closure allocates new strings - can this be optimized, or is there a security risk in the allocation pattern? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 49] [Style constant] The hardcoded Style::default().bg(Color::Red) - can this style be exploited if the terminal doesn't support ANSI color codes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 52] [Type cast] Casting u16 to usize for get_source_index_for_line - on 16-bit platforms (if any), could this cause issues with pointer arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 56] [Default fallback] When source index is None, backing_string() is called again - can this be expensive for large files, causing performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 60] [Unwrap usage] The unwrap() call assumes source_for_code_location never fails - what if the source file was deleted or modified between bytecode compilation and viewing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 63-65] [String concatenation] TextBuilder adds three separate strings - are there buffer overflow risks in the underlying TextBuilder implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 72-75] [Iterator collection] The collect() operation creates a new Vec - for very large bytecode files, can this cause allocation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 83] [Checked arithmetic] While checked_sub is used, unwrap() negates the safety benefit - should this return an error instead of panicking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/viewer.rs] [Line 90] [Direct indexing] bytecode_text[line_number as usize] assumes line_number is always in bounds - is this guaranteed by the caller? (High)"
