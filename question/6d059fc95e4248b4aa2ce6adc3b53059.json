  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [No secret correlation] The V and C arrays are generated independently - does this break the cryptographic relationship between commitments and shares required for PVSS security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [Fixed player 0] Line 192 always sets dealer to player 0 - can this cause dealer tracking errors if generate() is misused in multi-dealer scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [Weak RNG acceptance] The function accepts any CryptoRng - can weak RNGs be passed to generate predictable transcripts for testing that accidentally get used in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: generate()] [No validation] Generated transcripts are not validated - can they violate cryptographic invariants that cause verification failures or security breaks when used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [No verification required] Line 204 aggregates other transcript without verifying it first - can malicious validators inject forged transcripts that poison the aggregated result and compromise DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Scalar addition overflow] Lines 209-210 add scalars C[i] += other.C[i] - can carefully crafted values cause field overflow/wraparound, producing unexpected key shares? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Point addition issues] Lines 210-212 add G2Projective points - can point at infinity be injected to neutralize contributions from honest dealers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Mutable reference to self] aggregation mutates self in-place - can race conditions during concurrent aggregation corrupt transcript state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Dealer list extension] Line 213 blindly extends dealers list - can duplicate dealers be added, or can the list grow unbounded causing DoS through memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [No uniqueness check] Dealers from other are added without checking for duplicates - can a Byzantine validator contribute multiple times, gaining disproportionate influence over the generated key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Array size mismatch] If other has different size arrays (bypassing verify), can aggregation panic or produce corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Debug assertions only] Lines 205-206 and 215-216 use debug_assert - are these checks removed in release builds, allowing size mismatches in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Self-aggregation] Can a transcript be aggregated with itself (self-reference), doubling all values and corrupting the DKG state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Order dependency] Is aggregation commutative and associative, or can aggregating transcripts in different orders produce different results, causing validator disagreement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Threshold violation] After aggregation, does the result still satisfy threshold properties, or can aggregating t+1 transcripts produce a result that requires fewer shares than threshold? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: aggregate_with()] [Zero contribution attack] Can a malicious dealer submit an all-zeros transcript that nullifies honest contributions when aggregated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Dealer impersonation] Line 229 allows arbitrary replacement of dealers list with any player - can this be exploited to falsely attribute transcripts to innocent validators, framing them for malicious behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Unused signing key] The _ssk parameter is not used - is signature mauling supposed to require cryptographic proof, and does skipping it enable unauthorized dealer changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Unused auxiliary data] The _aux parameter is ignored - should context like epoch or round be verified before allowing dealer changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Malleability by design] The function name suggests intentional malleability - can this be exploited to replay transcripts with modified attribution, breaking non-repudiation in DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [Single dealer override] This replaces entire dealers vec with single player - can multi-dealer transcript attributions be erased, losing accountability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Function: maul_signature()] [No verification update] After mauling, are signatures or proofs updated to reflect new dealer, or does this create inconsistency between dealer claim and cryptographic evidence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Cross-function: deal() -> verify()] [Determinism mismatch] deal() is deterministic given inputs, but verify() uses non-deterministic thread_rng() - can the same dealt transcript pass verification on some nodes but fail on others? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/insecure_field/transcript.rs] [Cross-function: generate() -> verify()] [Random transcript verification] Can randomly generated transcripts from generate() pass verification despite having no valid secret/commitment relationship? (Critical)",
