(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: handle_completed_inbound_upgrade()] [Error logging verbosity] The warn! log at line 311 includes the full error - could verbose transport errors expose cryptographic handshake failures that help attackers optimize attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs] [Function: handle_completed_inbound_upgrade()] [Silent success] On successful upgrade at line 306-308, there's no verification of connection metadata - could malicious connections with corrupted metadata be forwarded to PeerManager? (High)",
