  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker bypass network validation by providing a chain_id string with leading/trailing whitespace that gets trimmed and matches after parsing, potentially allowing cross-chain replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Chain ID Confusion] Does the trim() operation on network identifier allow attackers to inject whitespace-padded chain IDs that pass validation but cause downstream parsing inconsistencies? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: check_network()] [Logic Bypass] Does the function properly handle the case where blockchain name is 'aptos' but the ChainId parsing fails, or could this lead to inconsistent error states? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: handle_request()] [Future Pinning] Does the Box::pin() operation at line 96 properly handle panics in the inner future, or can unhandled panics corrupt shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: handle_request()] [Clone Safety] Is the RosettaContext clone operation at line 52 safe when rest_client and block_cache are Arc-wrapped, or can this lead to unexpected shared mutable state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent account queries during state transitions return inconsistent account data if the underlying rest_client doesn't properly synchronize reads? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_account()] [Address Validation] Is the AccountAddress parameter validated before the REST call, or can specially crafted addresses cause the REST client to behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_timestamp()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a u64::MAX timestamp_usecs value that causes overflow during the division by 1000 at line 114, leading to incorrect timestamp calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_timestamp()] [Time Manipulation] Does the Y2K_MS clamping at line 117-119 allow attackers to submit blocks with pre-2000 timestamps that get normalized, enabling timestamp-based attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_timestamp()] [Timestamp Consistency] Can the microsecond to millisecond conversion lose precision in ways that cause transaction ordering issues or enable timestamp-based replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: get_timestamp()] [Boundary Condition] Does the comparison at line 117 handle the exact Y2K_MS boundary correctly, or could edge cases at exactly 946713600000 microseconds cause inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/common.rs] [Function: strip_hex_prefix()] [Input Validation] Can attackers provide malformed hex strings without 0x prefix that pass through but cause parsing errors downstream, leading to transaction construction failures? (Medium)",
