  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: push_back()] [Queue Flooding] Byzantine validator can continuously push_back() new QueueItems without them being dequeued - how is rate limiting enforced? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [Repeated Calls] Attacker can call set_randomness() repeatedly for same round (returns false after first) - can this cause performance degradation through repeated HashMap lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: item_mut()] [Scan Attack] item_mut() scans O(n) items in range query - can attacker query high round numbers to maximize scan time? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: all_rand_metadata()] [Computation DoS] all_rand_metadata() iterates and allocates for all blocks - can repeated calls exhaust CPU/memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [State Transition] Decrementing num_undecided_blocks changes QueueItem state - can invalid state transitions leave queue in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_rand_ready_prefix()] [Partial Dequeue] If dequeue succeeds for some items but fails for others, is partial state rollback handled correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: QueueItem] [Invariant Violation] num_undecided_blocks must match count of blocks without randomness - can direct field access break this invariant? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [Metric Skew] observe_block() at line 72-75 only called on first set - can repeated set attempts go unmonitored hiding attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: push_back()] [Timestamp Race] observe_block() uses block.timestamp_usecs() - can timestamp manipulation cause incorrect performance metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_rand_ready_prefix()] [Missing Metrics] No metrics on queue depth or growth rate - can unbounded growth go undetected until OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: QueueItem] [OrderedBlocks Contract] Assumes OrderedBlocks.ordered_blocks is immutable after creation - can external modifications break offsets_by_round mapping? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [PipelinedBlock Dependency] Calls block.set_randomness() which uses OnceCell - if OnceCell implementation changes, can this break set_randomness() assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Struct: QueueItem] [DropGuard Lifetime] broadcast_handle DropGuards are dropped when QueueItem is dropped - can premature drop abort critical randomness broadcast tasks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Test: test_queue_item] [Missing Concurrency Tests] Tests at lines 168-188 don't test concurrent access - can race conditions exist that tests don't cover? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Test Coverage] [Panic Paths] Tests don't verify panic conditions like assert!(len > 0) - can production code hit untested panic paths? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [Randomness Source] Randomness parameter origin not verified - can attacker inject deterministic or biased randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: all_rand_metadata()] [Entropy Leak] FullRandMetadata may contain sensitive randomness generation data - can early access enable grinding attacks? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: push_back()] [First Round Collision] Multiple QueueItems can have blocks with overlapping rounds but different first_round() - can this cause BTreeMap to miss items during item_mut() lookup? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_rand_ready_prefix()] [Atomic Dequeue] Dequeue removes from BTreeMap but returns Vec - if caller fails to process returned blocks, are they lost forever causing data loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/block_queue.rs] [Function: set_randomness()] [Idempotency Violation] Second call with different Randomness returns false but doesn't error - can caller assume success when randomness was already set to different value? (High)"
