  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: StageTracking] [Multi-variable atomicity] stage_counter and stage_start_time are separate atomics - can updates to one be visible without updates to other? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Vec reallocation] Result Vec is returned - can large num_to_create cause excessive memory allocation or OOM? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Struct: WorkflowTxnGenerator] [Box type erasure] Generators stored as Box<dyn TransactionGenerator> - can this hide memory leaks in implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGeneratorCreator::create_transaction_generator()] [Clone explosion] Each call clones Arc references - can excessive cloning cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/workflow_delegator.rs] [Function: WorkflowTxnGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Stage 0 special case] First stage always uses MaxTransactions - can this cause different behavior than subsequent stages? (Medium)",
