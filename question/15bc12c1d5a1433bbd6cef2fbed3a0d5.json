  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_rand.rs] [Function: criterion_benchmark()] [Zero sampling] Do the benchmarks detect if sample_field_element or scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes can return the field zero element, which would compromise private key security in validator key generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_rand.rs] [Function: bench_sample_field_element_generic()] [Panic behavior] Does the benchmark catch potential panics in sample_field_element's infinite retry loop that could crash validators during key generation ceremonies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_rand.rs] [Function: bench_scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes_generic()] [Error propagation] Could the benchmark miss error conditions in scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes where invalid byte arrays cause silent failures instead of explicit errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_rand.rs] [Function: bench_sample_field_element_generic()] [Memory allocation] Does the benchmark measure heap allocation frequency in sample_field_element's vec![0u8; num_bytes], which could exhaust memory during validator epoch transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_rand.rs] [Function: bench_scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes_generic()] [Double memory] Does the 2x memory allocation in scalar_from_uniform_be_bytes pose DoS risks during simultaneous key generation by all validators that the benchmark should detect? (Low)"
