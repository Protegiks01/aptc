  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Incomplete Validation] Does sanitize() validate that direct_send_data_size and rpc_data_size are non-zero when their respective test modes are enabled, preventing division-by-zero or no-op testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Range Validation] Does sanitize() enforce maximum bounds on max_network_channel_size (e.g., < 1 million) to prevent unreasonable memory allocations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Rate Limit Validation] Does sanitize() validate that direct_send_per_second and rpc_per_second are within reasonable bounds (e.g., 1 to 1 million) to prevent misconfiguration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Thread Count Validation] Does sanitize() validate that netbench_service_threads (when Some) is reasonable (e.g., 1 to 64) and not excessively large? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Consistency Validation] Does sanitize() check for logical inconsistencies, such as enable_direct_send_testing=true but direct_send_per_second=0? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error Message] Does the error message at lines 69-71 provide enough detail for operators to understand why netbench was rejected, or could it be more specific? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error Type] Is Error::ConfigSanitizerFailed the appropriate error type, or should there be a more specific NetbenchConfigError variant for better error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Panic Handling] Could unwrap() at line 60 panic if node_config.netbench contains Some(None) in a malformed config, causing node crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Production Safety] Is the mainnet/testnet check sufficient, or should there be additional safeguards like requiring explicit environment variables or build flags to enable netbench? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Default Enabled] If a config file is malformed and netbench.enabled defaults to false, could this hide configuration errors that should be caught during validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Service Lifecycle] When netbench.enabled changes from true to false (or vice versa), is the netbench service properly started/stopped, or could this leave resources in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Network Interference] Can netbench traffic interfere with critical consensus or state sync messages when max_network_channel_size is reached, potentially causing liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Resource Conflicts] Do the tokio threads allocated to netbench_service_threads conflict with threads used by consensus, execution, or storage services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Integration] [Metrics Collection] Does netbench properly integrate with node metrics and monitoring, or could high-volume testing skew important performance indicators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Security Model] [Threat Model] What is the threat model for netbench - should it be treated as untrusted input from operators, or is it assumed to be trusted configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Security Model] [Attack Surface] Does enabling netbench expose additional attack surface (RPC endpoints, direct send handlers) that could be exploited even in devnet/testnet environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Security Model] [Privilege Escalation] Can an attacker with access to modify config files enable netbench on a running production node, bypassing the chain_id check through config reload? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Arithmetic] [Multiplication Overflow] Can direct_send_data_size * direct_send_per_second overflow when calculating total throughput, causing wrapping behavior and incorrect rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Arithmetic] [Multiplication Overflow] Can rpc_data_size * rpc_per_second overflow when calculating RPC throughput requirements, leading to buffer underallocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Arithmetic] [Cast Overflow] When converting between u64 (direct_send_per_second) and usize for array indexing or loop counters, could this cause truncation on 32-bit systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Arithmetic] [Interval Calculation] If direct_send_per_second is used to calculate sleep intervals (1_000_000 / direct_send_per_second microseconds), can extremely large values cause near-zero intervals leading to busy-wait loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Persistence] [Hot Reload] If config is reloaded at runtime, does sanitize() get called again, or could a previously safe config become unsafe after chain_id changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Persistence] [Partial Updates] Can NetbenchConfig be partially updated (e.g., only changing max_network_channel_size) without re-running sanitize(), bypassing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/netbench_config.rs] [Persistence] [State Corruption] If node crashes while NetbenchConfig is being persisted to disk, could this result in corrupted config on restart? (Low)"
