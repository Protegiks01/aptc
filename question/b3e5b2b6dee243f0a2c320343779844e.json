  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Transaction Execution] [Partial module updates] If a transaction modifies modules mid-execution, can this cause the Modules struct to become inconsistent with on-chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Storage] [Module serialization] When modules are persisted to storage, are the dependency relationships preserved correctly, or can deserialization create orphaned modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Storage] [State sync gaps] During state synchronization, can validators receive incomplete module sets that pass validation in Modules::new() but fail during execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Storage] [Snapshot consistency] Are module snapshots consistent with dependency graphs, or can there be mismatches that cause execution failures after restoring from snapshots? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [API] [Public module exposure] Does the get_map() function expose internal BTreeMap structure in a way that violates encapsulation, allowing external mutation of module references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [API] [Lifetime contract] Do all public functions properly document and enforce lifetime requirements, or can callers violate lifetime invariants leading to memory safety issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Verification] [Untested edge cases] Are circular dependencies, maximum recursion depth, and module duplication scenarios covered by tests, or can real-world attacks exploit untested paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Verification] [Formal verification gap] Has the recursive transitive dependency traversal been formally verified for termination, or could there be undiscovered infinite loop conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-utils/src/lib.rs] [Verification] [Fuzzing coverage] Have all functions been fuzz-tested with malformed CompiledModule inputs to ensure robustness against bytecode corruption? (Medium)"
