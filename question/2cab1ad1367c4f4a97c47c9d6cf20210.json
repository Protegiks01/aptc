  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Architecture: Version compatibility] If the DbReader/DbWriter traits are updated with new methods, could the mock become out of sync, causing tests to compile but not validate new functionality? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Architecture: Mock detection] Is there a way for production code to detect at runtime that it's using MockDbReaderWriter instead of a real implementation, preventing accidental production deployment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Security: Access control bypass] The mock has no authentication or authorization checks - could tests fail to validate that real implementations properly verify caller permissions before returning sensitive state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Security: Cryptographic validation] The empty SparseMerkleProofExt never validates cryptographic signatures or hash commitments - could tests miss bugs in proof verification that could be exploited for state forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Security: Input sanitization] The mock accepts any StateKey without validation - could tests miss injection attacks, path traversal, or other input validation bugs in real storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Security: Side-channel leaks] The mock's deterministic behavior never tests timing attacks or information leakage through error messages that could reveal sensitive state information in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Security: Resource exhaustion] The mock doesn't limit request rates, batch sizes, or concurrent access - could tests miss DoS vulnerabilities where unlimited storage queries overwhelm the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Invariant: Merkle root consistency] Since proofs are empty and versions are ignored, could tests fail to validate the critical invariant that state_root = hash(all_state_at_version), breaking blockchain verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Invariant: Version monotonicity] The mock doesn't enforce that version numbers increase monotonically - could tests miss bugs where versions decrease during rollbacks or epoch changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Invariant: State determinism] Since the mock's behavior doesn't depend on execution order or timing, could tests fail to catch non-deterministic behavior in real storage that could cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/storage-interface/src/mock.rs] [Invariant: Atomicity] The mock processes each request independently - could tests miss violations of multi-key atomic read/write guarantees that are critical for transaction semantics? (High)"
