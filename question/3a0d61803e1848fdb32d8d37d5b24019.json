  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Error: Recovery] [Unrecoverable Errors] When DecryptionError or EncryptionError occurs, can the stream recover, or is it permanently in an error state causing resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/error.rs] [Error: Conversion] [Error Context Loss] Does the From<application::error::Error> implementation lose important error context by converting to UnexpectedError? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Testing: Edge Cases] [Untested Paths] Are all error paths in upgrade_inbound() thoroughly tested, or could untested branches contain security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Testing: Fuzzing] [Fuzz Coverage] Has the NoiseStream parsing logic been fuzzed with malformed frame lengths and corrupted ciphertext to identify parsing bugs? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/mod.rs] [Module: Exports] [API Surface] Does the module export only necessary types and functions, or do internal implementation details leak through the API surface? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Role Assignment] In MaybeMutual mode, when inferring peer role based on network context (lines 408-423), can an attacker on a VFN network be incorrectly classified as ValidatorFullNode, gaining elevated privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Network ID Validation] Does the code validate that the network_id from network_context matches the expected network, or can an attacker connect on one network while claiming to be on another? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Constant: PROLOGUE_SIZE] [Size Calculation] Is PROLOGUE_SIZE correctly calculated as PeerId::LENGTH + x25519::PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE, or could size mismatches cause buffer overflows when splitting the prologue? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_outbound()] [Remote Peer Validation] Does upgrade_outbound() validate that the remote_peer_id and remote_public_key are consistent before initiating the handshake? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Payload Handling] When anti-replay is disabled (MaybeMutual mode), is the payload field from the handshake properly ignored, or could an attacker include malicious data that gets processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: upgrade_inbound()] [Response Timing] Does the server always respond to handshake attempts in constant time regardless of authentication result, or can timing reveal whether a peer_id is in the trusted set? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Function: authenticate_inbound()] [Empty Key Set] If peer.keys is an empty set, does contains() return false correctly, or could this edge case cause authentication bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read()] [State: Init to ReadFrameLen] [Unconditional Transition] Does the immediate transition from Init to ReadFrameLen happen without validating stream state, potentially allowing reads on a closed stream? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read()] [State: ReadFrame] [Frame Length Zero] If frame_len is somehow 0 after passing initial validation, could this cause issues in the ReadFrame state at line 135? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_read()] [State: CopyDecryptedFrame] [Partial Copies] If poll_read() is called multiple times during CopyDecryptedFrame state, is the offset properly maintained across calls to ensure all data is copied? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_write_or_flush()] [State: Init] [Double Flush] If flush is called when WriteState is Init (no pending data), does this cause any issues or unnecessary socket flushes? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Function: poll_write_or_flush()] [State: BufferData] [Max Buffer] When offset reaches MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_LENGTH exactly, does the encryption happen correctly, or is there an off-by-one error? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Noise: Initiator State] [State Leakage] When initiate_connection() returns an initiator_state, is this state properly protected, or could it leak cryptographic material if logged or serialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Noise: Session Keys] [Key Lifetime] Are session keys derived from the handshake properly scoped to a single connection, or could key reuse across connections enable cryptographic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Noise: Payload Encryption] [Payload Size] Is the timestamp payload always exactly TIMESTAMP_SIZE bytes when encrypted, or could padding/alignment issues cause size variations? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Noise: Message Counter] [Counter Overflow] Does the noise session maintain a message counter that could overflow after many messages, potentially causing nonce reuse? (Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/stream.rs] [Noise: Forward Secrecy] [Session Persistence] If a NoiseSession is serialized and persisted, does this break forward secrecy by allowing old messages to be decrypted? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/noise/handshake.rs] [Network: Socket Type] [Socket Capabilities] Does the code make assumptions about socket capabilities (blocking vs non-blocking, TCP vs other protocols) that could cause issues? (Low)"
