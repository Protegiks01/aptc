  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Function: from_move_type()] [Tuple unpacking] Line 150-155 extracts (address, module, name) but only uses address - are module and name validated elsewhere, or can malicious modules/names bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoType] [to_hash() vs get_coin_type_trunc()] [Inconsistency] The struct has both to_hash() and get_coin_type_trunc() - which should be used as the primary key for coin identification, and can inconsistent usage cause tracking errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Function: get_aggregator_metadata()] [Chained Options] The function chains multiple .first() calls which return Options - can this silently return None for partially initialized aggregators instead of raising an error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [Public decimals] The decimals field is public while name and symbol are private - is this intentional, or can external code mutate decimals causing invariant violations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [Public supply] The supply field is public allowing external access to the nested aggregator structure - can external code mutate this causing supply tracking corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: OptionalAggregatorWrapperResource] [Public vec] All wrapper structs expose public vec fields - can external code push/pop elements causing the indexer to track incorrect supply sources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: CoinInfoResource] [Decimals range] Decimals is i32 (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) - are negative decimals semantically valid, and can i32::MAX decimals cause overflow in 10^decimals calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Struct: EventGuidResource] [creation_num overflow] Using i64 for creation_num allows ~9 quintillion events - but can integer overflow if an account creates events in a tight loop, causing event GUID collisions? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Function: from_event()] [Return type asymmetry] from_event returns Result<Option<CoinEvent>> but from_resource returns Result<CoinResource> - can this inconsistency cause calling code to mishandle errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/coin_models/coin_utils.rs] [Constant: COIN_TYPE_HASH_LENGTH] [Centralized definition] The constant is defined here but used by truncate_str() from util module - if util module changes truncation behavior, can this cause hash mismatches between indexer versions?
