  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Loopback] Is the IPv6 loopback address (::1) properly matched if in the blocklist, or could variations like 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 bypass detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 ULA Bypass] Can attackers behind IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (fc00::/7) make unlimited requests if ULA ranges aren't blocklisted, similar to IPv4 private address issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Documentation Range] Are documentation ranges (2001:db8::/32) properly validated and blocked, or could test/documentation IPs be used for attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Multicast] Can multicast IPv6 addresses (ff00::/8) bypass the blocklist check and be used for attacks if the faucet incorrectly accepts them as source addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Link-Local] Do link-local addresses (fe80::/10) get proper validation, or could they bypass blocklist restrictions in misconfigured network setups? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [IPv6 Memory Exhaustion] Given IPv6's massive address space, could an attacker add billions of /128 addresses to the blocklist causing memory exhaustion when ipv6_list is constructed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Protocol Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the separate IPv4 and IPv6 matching paths by using IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses (::a.b.c.d) that might be classified incorrectly, bypassing blocklist entries in both lists? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Dual Stack Evasion] In dual-stack networks, if an IP is blocked on IPv4 but the same host connects via IPv6, does the system detect this as the same attacker, or can they bypass the blocklist by switching protocols? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [NAT64/DNS64 Bypass] Can attackers behind NAT64/DNS64 gateways that translate between IPv4 and IPv6 bypass blocklists by making requests that appear to come from the NAT gateway's IP rather than their actual source? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Well-Known Prefix] Does the checker properly handle the IPv4-IPv6 translation well-known prefix (64:ff9b::/96) used in NAT64, or could this be exploited to bypass blocklist entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Concurrent Access Safety] Since check() is async and can be called concurrently by multiple requests, are the ipv4_list and ipv6_list accessed in a thread-safe manner without requiring synchronization, or could concurrent reads during blocklist updates cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Manager Reference Safety] The manager field is accessed via immutable reference (&self) in an async context - is the IpRangeManager guaranteed to be Sync, or could improper interior mutability lead to data races when multiple concurrent checks occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [TOCTOU in Checker Flow] Between when check() validates an IP and when the actual funding occurs, could the IP be added to the blocklist, creating a race condition where blocked IPs can still receive one final funding transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Struct: IpBlocklistChecker] [Shared State] If multiple IpBlocklistChecker instances share the same underlying file or configuration, could concurrent modifications to the blocklist file cause inconsistent checking behavior across instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Async Cancellation] If an async check() call is cancelled mid-execution (e.g., client disconnects), are there any partially-updated states or resources that aren't properly cleaned up, potentially leading to inconsistent IP checking? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Information Leak] Does the rejection message format string reveal the exact blocked IP address, potentially leaking information about which specific ranges are in the blocklist that attackers could use to find gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Panic Safety] If ipv4_list.contains() or ipv6_list.contains() panics due to internal library bugs, does this crash the entire faucet service, or is the panic caught and handled gracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Result Error Propagation] When returning RejectionReason wrapped in Ok(), is there any possibility of the error being dropped or mishandled upstream, causing blocked IPs to be silently allowed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Empty Rejection Handling] When an IP is not in the blocklist, check() returns Ok(vec![]) - could upstream code misinterpret empty Vec as an error condition rather than successful validation, causing false positives? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor Error Message] If IpRangeManager::new() fails, does the error message expose sensitive file paths or internal directory structures that could aid attackers in understanding the system layout? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: check()] [Dry Run Bypass] The _dry_run parameter is unused - could this mean blocklist checks are always written to logs/metrics even in dry_run mode, potentially causing DoS through log exhaustion or metric cardinality explosion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: cost()] [Checker Ordering] With cost() returning 1, IpBlocklistChecker runs early in the checker pipeline - if a cheaper checker could reject most requests, is running IP blocklist checks first causing unnecessary CPU usage and potential DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Function: cost()] [Cost Manipulation] Is the cost value of 1 hardcoded and unchangeable at runtime, or could an attacker with configuration access modify it to deprioritize IP blocking, allowing more bypass attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Missing Complete Implementation] Since IpBlocklistChecker doesn't override the complete() method, does this mean blocked IPs aren't recorded in storage for forensic analysis, making it harder to detect and respond to attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/checkers/ip_blocklist.rs] [Trait: CheckerTrait] [Missing Periodic Tasks] Without implementing spawn_periodic_tasks(), the blocklist never auto-updates - can administrators hot-reload blocklist changes without restarting, or must they manually restart the faucet service creating a vulnerability window? (Medium)"
