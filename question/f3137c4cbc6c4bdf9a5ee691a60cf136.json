  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 8] [First flag logic] The 'first' boolean is set to false after processing the first character. Is this logic sound for edge cases like starting with multiple uppercase letters (e.g., 'HTTP')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 10-12] [Underscore injection] For an input like 'MyAPIKey', does this produce 'my_api_key' or 'my_a_p_i_key'? Could the inconsistency enable collisions with manually defined names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 17] [Non-uppercase handling] Characters that are neither uppercase nor lowercase (digits, punctuation) are pushed as-is. Could '1stClass' and 'FirstClass' collide if converted to '1st_class' and 'first_class'? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Trailing underscores] Can the function produce trailing underscores (e.g., 'MyType_')? Would this collide with 'MyType' and break hasher uniqueness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Multiple consecutive underscores] If the input is 'My__Type', could this produce 'my___type' with triple underscores, and would this collide with 'my_type'? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 7] [Memory allocation] For extremely long type names (e.g., 1MB strings), could the String allocation cause memory exhaustion during compilation, DoS-ing the build process? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 9-19] [Iteration complexity] The function iterates character-by-character using 'text.chars()'. For multi-byte Unicode, could this be exploited to cause excessive compilation time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 12] [extend() call] Using 'out.extend(c.to_lowercase())' for each character could cause multiple allocations. Is this vulnerable to performance degradation with maliciously crafted type names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Static identifier generation] The output is used to create static identifiers (e.g., VALIDATOR_CONFIG_SEED). If conversion produces invalid Rust identifiers (starting with numbers), does this cause compilation errors that could prevent protocol upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Uppercase conversion] The output is uppercased for constant names (e.g., VALIDATOR_CONFIG_HASHER). Could this cause collisions if two types differ only in case but produce identical uppercase constants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Seed generation] The snake_case name is used in DefaultHasher::prefixed_hash() to generate cryptographic seeds. Are there input patterns that produce predictable or weak seeds enabling pre-image attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Serde name mismatch] The function operates on item.ident.to_string(), but the actual seed uses serde_name::trace_name(). Could discrepancies between Rust identifiers and Serde names cause hasher mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [ValidatorConfig collision] Could a malicious actor deploy a Move module with a type name that collides with 'ValidatorConfig' after snake_case conversion, enabling them to forge validator set updates or steal staking rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Coin collision] Can an attacker create a token type that collides with 'aptos_framework::coin::Coin' hasher, allowing them to mint unlimited APT tokens or steal from user accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [StakePool collision] Could type name collisions with 'StakePool' enable unauthorized withdrawal of staked APT, breaking validator economic security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [GovernanceProposal collision] Can colliding hasher names for governance types allow attackers to bypass voting requirements or execute malicious protocol upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Block collision] If block metadata types have colliding hashers, could this enable consensus manipulation or chain reorganization attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake(), line 10, 12, 15] [Locale-dependent lowercase] Does 'c.to_lowercase()' behave identically across different locales (e.g., Turkish locale where 'I'.to_lowercase() != 'i')? Could this cause non-deterministic hasher generation across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Rust version differences] Have there been changes to char::is_uppercase() or char::to_lowercase() across Rust versions? Could validator nodes on different Rust versions produce different hashers, causing consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Platform differences] Are there differences in Unicode handling between Linux, macOS, and Windows that could cause different hasher names, breaking cross-platform consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Breaking changes] If this function is modified to fix a bug (e.g., better acronym handling), would all existing hasher seeds change, breaking on-chain state verification and requiring a hardfork? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Backwards compatibility] Is there a mechanism to preserve old hasher seeds during protocol upgrades? Could changing conversion logic invalidate historical Merkle proofs or signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Version skew] During a rolling validator upgrade, could nodes with different versions of this function produce incompatible hashers, causing epoch transition failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Test coverage] Are there comprehensive tests for Unicode edge cases, acronym handling, and collision detection? Could untested input patterns enable production exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto-derive/src/hasher.rs] [Function: camel_to_snake()] [Collision detection] Is there runtime or compile-time detection of hasher name collisions? Could duplicate hasher seeds go unnoticed until exploited in production? (Medium)"
