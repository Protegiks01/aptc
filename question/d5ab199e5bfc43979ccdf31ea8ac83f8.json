  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ProposerElectionType] [Fixed proposer centralization] Can ProposerElectionType::FixedProposer with a small contiguous_rounds value be exploited to centralize block proposal to a single Byzantine validator, enabling censorship attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ProposerElectionType] [Rotating proposer predictability] Does RotatingProposer use a deterministic rotation that allows attackers to predict future proposers and target them with DoS attacks during their proposal windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ProposerElectionType] [RoundProposer manipulation] Can malicious governance proposals use RoundProposer to hard-code specific validators as proposers for critical rounds, enabling transaction censorship or MEV extraction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ProposerElectionType] [HashMap round collision] In RoundProposer's HashMap<Round, AccountAddress>, can round number collisions or wraparound cause incorrect proposer assignments that violate election fairness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: ProposerElectionType] [LeaderReputation gaming] Can validators game the LeaderReputation election by intentionally failing proposals to manipulate their reputation scores and increase selection probability for profitable rounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: use_root_hash_for_seed()] [Seed predictability] Does ProposerAndVoter (V1) using a simple predictable seed enable attackers to pre-compute future proposer elections and manipulate validator behavior to influence outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: use_root_hash_for_seed()] [Root hash manipulation] Can validators collude to manipulate the root hash used as seed in ProposerAndVoterV2, biasing leader election toward Byzantine validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Function: use_reputation_window_from_stale_end()] [Window selection attack] Does ProposerAndVoter's stale-end reputation window create vulnerabilities where recent Byzantine behavior isn't considered, allowing recently compromised validators to be elected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Enum: LeaderReputationType] [Version confusion] Can network disagreement on LeaderReputationType (V1 vs V2) cause validators to elect different proposers for the same round, forking the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Weight manipulation] Can malicious governance set active_weight, inactive_weight, or failed_weight to extreme values (0 or u64::MAX) to completely exclude certain validator classes from ever being elected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ProposerAndVoterConfig] [Weight overflow] If active_weight is u64::MAX and weight_by_voting_power is true, can multiplication with voting power cause integer overflow in weight calculations, corrupting election results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: failure_threshold_percent] [Threshold bypass] Can setting failure_threshold_percent to 0 classify all validators as 'failed', or setting it to 100 ignore all failures, breaking reputation-based election security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: failure_threshold_percent] [Type confusion] Is failure_threshold_percent (u32) properly validated to be ≤100, or can values >100 cause unexpected behavior in percentage calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: proposer_window_num_validators_multiplier] [Window size attack] Can setting proposer_window_num_validators_multiplier to 0 eliminate reputation tracking, or to usize::MAX cause memory exhaustion when allocating history buffers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: voter_window_num_validators_multiplier] [Voter tracking bypass] Can voter_window_num_validators_multiplier=0 disable voter reputation tracking, allowing non-participating validators to maintain high reputation unfairly?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: weight_by_voting_power] [Centralization risk] If weight_by_voting_power=false, do all validators get equal election probability regardless of stake, enabling Sybil attacks by creating many low-stake validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: use_history_from_previous_epoch_max_count] [Epoch history poisoning] Can malicious validators in epoch N intentionally fail to poison history, then use use_history_from_previous_epoch_max_count in epoch N+1 to maintain low reputation weights for honest validators?

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: use_history_from_previous_epoch_max_count] [Epoch boundary attack] At epoch transitions, can inconsistent use_history_from_previous_epoch_max_count values across validators cause divergent proposer election results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: decoupled_execution] [Execution coupling attack] Although decoupled_execution() always returns true, does the stored field still affect behavior, and can governance set it to false to create execution/consensus coupling vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: back_pressure_limit] [Deprecated field abuse] Is the deprecated back_pressure_limit field actually unused everywhere, or can it still be exploited by attackers who set extreme values via governance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: exclude_round] [Reputation window manipulation] Can governance set exclude_round to u64::MAX to effectively disable all reputation tracking, or to 0 to include even the most recent incomplete rounds in reputation calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/consensus_config.rs] [Field: exclude_round] [Round arithmetic overflow] Can exclude_round set near u64::MAX cause integer overflow when computing reputation window boundaries (current_round - exclude_round)? (Medium)",
