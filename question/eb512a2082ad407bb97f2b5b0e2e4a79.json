  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Telemetry level manipulation] At line 41 where telemetry_level(node_config.logger.telemetry_level) is configured, can an attacker who controls this setting disable telemetry logging to hide malicious validator behavior from remote monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Remote log data exfiltration] When enable_telemetry_remote_log is true at line 50 and remote_log_tx is configured at line 52, can an attacker who compromises the telemetry receiver intercept sensitive log data containing validator keys, consensus state, or transaction details? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Telemetry flush DOS] At line 42 where enable_telemetry_flush is configured, can forcing frequent telemetry flushes cause performance degradation in consensus by blocking the logging thread, delaying block proposal and vote processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Tokio console exposure] At line 43 where tokio_console_port is configured, if this debugging port is exposed to the network, can an attacker connect to it to view internal async runtime state, potentially leaking validator operations, consensus timing, or transaction processing details? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Port conflict attack] When tokio_console_port is set at line 43, can an attacker pre-bind this port to prevent the tokio console from starting, causing the node to crash on initialization if the port binding is required? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Backtrace exposure] At lines 44-46 where enable_backtrace is conditionally enabled, does backtrace logging expose sensitive memory addresses, function call sequences, or validator state that could help attackers craft exploits against specific code paths in the consensus or execution engine? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Backtrace performance impact] When enable_backtrace is true at line 44, can the overhead of capturing backtraces on every log message cause consensus performance degradation, increasing block proposal latency and potentially causing liveness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Receiver drop] At line 63 where (remote_log_receiver, logger_filter_updater) is returned, if the caller drops the remote_log_receiver without consuming messages, can this cause the sender side to block and eventually deadlock the logger thread when the channel fills up? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Updater lifecycle] When LoggerFilterUpdater is returned at line 63, if it's dropped without calling run(), does the logger lose the ability to dynamically update filters, potentially leaving debug logging enabled in production and causing performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Missing channel size validation] At line 38 where chan_size is applied without validation, can an attacker set chan_size to 0 causing channel creation to fail or panic, crashing the validator during initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Log level manipulation] At line 40 where level(node_config.logger.level) is set without validation, can an attacker configure an invalid log level that causes the logger to panic or behave unexpectedly, potentially hiding critical errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Builder pattern state] In the logger_builder configuration at lines 37-53, can incorrect ordering of builder method calls cause conflicting configurations or undefined behavior in the logger initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Constant: TELEMETRY_LOG_INGEST_BUFFER_SIZE] [Integer overflow] Can the buffer size constant at line 13 (128) be manipulated during compilation or through unsafe code to cause integer overflow when multiplied by message sizes, leading to buffer overflows in the telemetry log channel? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Channel capacity overflow] At line 51 where mpsc::channel(TELEMETRY_LOG_INGEST_BUFFER_SIZE) is called, can passing usize::MAX or an extremely large buffer size cause integer overflow in the channel's internal calculations, resulting in a smaller-than-expected buffer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: log_config_and_build_information()] [Unwrap panic] At line 95 where set_password(Some('*')).unwrap() is called, can this unwrap() panic if password setting fails, crashing the node during initialization and preventing validator participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: log_config_and_build_information()] [Expect panic] At line 92, the expect('Invalid postgres uri') will panic on parse failure - can an attacker provide malformed configuration that deliberately triggers this panic during node startup, preventing the validator from joining consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: log_config_and_build_information()] [Config data exposure] At line 101 where the entire config is logged with {:?}, beyond postgres_uri, are there other sensitive fields in NodeConfig (validator keys, network secrets, API tokens) that get exposed in the logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: log_config_and_build_information()] [Debug format disclosure] When logging config at line 101 using Debug formatting ({:?}), can this expose internal memory representations, heap addresses, or other implementation details that aid in exploit development?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Logger builder mutation] Between lines 37-53 where logger_builder is mutated, if another thread accesses or clones this builder, can race conditions cause incomplete or corrupted logger configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [Global state race] At line 57 where logger_builder.build() creates the logger, does this modify global state that could race with other logger creation attempts, causing undefined behavior if create_logger() is called concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/logger.rs] [Function: create_logger()] [FileWriter leak] If FileWriter is created at line 48 but logger initialization fails later, is the file handle properly closed, or can repeated initialization failures leak file descriptors and eventually prevent the node from opening files?
