  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: new_without_info()] [Allocation Failure] If Vec::resize() at line 25 fails due to OOM, does Rust's allocator panic, and is this panic handled gracefully to prevent validator crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Struct: DefaultTxnProvider] [Drop Safety] When DefaultTxnProvider is dropped, if txns or auxiliary_info contain types with custom Drop implementations, could unwinding cause double-free or resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Computational DoS] The .iter().all() check at lines 57-60 has O(n) complexity and is called per get_auxiliary_info() - for blocks with 10,000+ transactions, could this cause quadratic complexity DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: new()] [Storage Exhaustion] If txns vector contains extremely large transactions (e.g., 1MB each) and a block has 10,000 transactions, does this cause multi-GB memory allocation that could exhaust validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Clone Overhead] Cloning auxiliary info at line 52 for every access - if A contains large nested structures and get_auxiliary_info() is called millions of times during parallel execution, could this cause performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: new_without_info()] [Memory Amplification] If len is large and A::new_empty() creates non-trivial objects, the resize at line 25 could amplify memory usage - can this be exploited for memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Version Migration] The comments at lines 63 and 66 mention 'version 0 behavior' and 'version 1 behavior' - during protocol upgrades, could validators running different versions execute different code paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Backward Compatibility] If old blocks (created with version 0) are re-executed on version 1 validators, will get_auxiliary_info() produce consistent results, or could version differences cause fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Feature Flag Dependency] Does the version 0 vs version 1 behavior depend on feature flags that could be enabled/disabled, causing non-deterministic execution across validators with different configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Struct: DefaultTxnProvider] [Serialization Safety] If DefaultTxnProvider is serialized for network transmission or storage, could deserialization on different versions cause type confusion or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_txn()] [Bounds Testing] Are there comprehensive tests validating that get_txn() correctly panics on out-of-bounds access, or could production validators have different panic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Edge Case Coverage] The complex branching logic at lines 51-73 has many edge cases - are all combinations of empty/non-empty auxiliary_info and in-bounds/out-of-bounds txn_index tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: new()] [Assertion Testing] Is the assertion at line 15 tested with adversarial inputs (e.g., txns.len()=MAX, auxiliary_info.len()=0) to ensure proper panic behavior? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: new()] [Assertion Message] The assertion at line 15 has no custom message - when it fails, will validators log sufficient context to diagnose the attack vector? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Struct: DefaultTxnProvider] [Field Visibility] Fields txns and auxiliary_info are private - does this properly encapsulate access, or could unsafe code or trait implementations bypass visibility controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/txn_provider/default.rs] [Function: get_auxiliary_info()] [Sampling Attack] At lines 57-60, sampling all auxiliary infos to check if all are None - if an attacker includes one non-None info at the end, does this force all validators to use version 1 behavior, potentially changing gas fees or validator rewards? (High)",
