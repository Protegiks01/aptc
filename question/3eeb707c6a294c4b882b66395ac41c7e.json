  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Database: upsert operation] [Primary key collision] Is the processor field truly unique as a primary key, or can hash collisions or Unicode issues cause multiple processors to map to the same key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Database: upsert operation] [Partial failure] If the upsert operation fails after updating last_success_version but before updating last_updated, can this cause monitoring systems to incorrectly report processor health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Field: last_success_version] [Version gap] Can an indexer skip versions by updating last_success_version non-sequentially, causing missing data in the indexed blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Field: last_success_version] [Version rollback attack] Can a malicious indexer operator rollback last_success_version to reprocess old transactions and manipulate indexed data like token balances or NFT ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Field: last_success_version] [Integer boundary] What happens when last_success_version approaches i64::MAX - can this cause crashes or undefined behavior in version arithmetic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Field: last_success_version] [Signed overflow] Since last_success_version is signed i64, can processing very large version numbers cause signed integer overflow leading to negative version tracking? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Field: last_success_version] [Monotonicity violation] Are there checks ensuring last_success_version only increases, or can bugs allow it to decrease and corrupt indexer state consistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Diesel: AsChangeset] [Update injection] Can the AsChangeset derive macro be exploited to update unintended columns if the struct is modified or used in unsafe update contexts? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Diesel: table_name] [Schema mismatch] If the processor_status table schema changes but the Rust struct is not updated, can this cause silent data corruption or type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/processor_status.rs] [Diesel: filter] [Query optimization] Can the filter().first() query pattern cause full table scans if indexes are missing, leading to performance degradation as processor count grows? (Low)",
