  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [YAML/JSON Parsing] If configs are loaded from YAML/JSON, can malicious formatting (deeply nested structures, large numbers) cause parser DoS before even reaching deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig] [Consensus Throughput] If max_sending_txns_per_round is set lower than network demand, can this artificial bottleneck allow Byzantine validators to profitably front-run transactions by controlling which ones enter consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig] [Network Partition] If validators configure vastly different max_receiving values, can the network partition into groups that accept different transaction volumes, causing inconsistent block contents? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig] [Data Availability] With only min_concurrent_responders=1, if that single responder is Byzantine, can it selectively withhold data blocks causing consensus to stall until timeout? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Message Amplification] Can aggressive retry policies (short backoff, many retries) cause exponential message amplification when multiple validators retry failed broadcasts simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig] [Round Synchronization] If adaptive_responsive_minimum_wait_time_ms varies across validators, can this cause rounds to start at different times, leading to proposal conflicts and safety violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig, Field: max_sending_size_per_round_bytes] [Resource Pricing] Does the 10MB default sending limit properly account for the economic cost of bandwidth? Can attackers cheaply flood the network with maximum-sized payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig, Field: max_concurrent_fetches] [Resource Exhaustion] With only 4 concurrent fetches allowed, can Byzantine nodes create fetch bottlenecks by serving data slowly, degrading consensus performance for economic gain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagHealthConfig, Field: voter_pipeline_latency_limit_ms] [Penalty Avoidance] Can Byzantine validators manipulate their latency to stay just under the 30 second limit while degrading performance, avoiding penalties while harming consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Hot Reload] If configs can be hot-reloaded during consensus operation, can mid-round config changes cause state inconsistencies where different validators use different limits for the same round? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Validation Timing] Is sanitize() called atomically with config updates, or can there be a gap where invalid configs are temporarily active? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Governance Manipulation] If config changes require governance approval, can a malicious majority gradually change limits (making txn limits progressively smaller) to degrade network usability without triggering alarms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagConsensusConfig] [Rollback Safety] If a config update causes consensus to fail and needs rollback, does the rollback mechanism preserve consensus state consistency or can it cause forks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig] [Zero Values] What happens if all payload limits are set to 0? Does consensus halt gracefully or enter an undefined state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagPayloadConfig] [MAX Values] If all fields are set to u64::MAX, can downstream code handle these extreme values without overflow or panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig] [Responder Limits] What if min_concurrent_responders > max_concurrent_responders due to config error? Is this checked anywhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: ReliableBroadcastConfig] [Backoff Edge Cases] If backoff_policy_max_delay_ms < backoff_policy_base_ms * backoff_policy_factor, does the first retry immediately hit the max, breaking exponential backoff? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagRoundStateConfig] [Negative Wait Time] Although the field is u64, if conversions to signed types occur elsewhere, can this create negative wait times causing immediate round progression? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Struct: DagFetcherConfig] [Type Inconsistency] Why is max_concurrent_fetches usize while min/max_concurrent_responders are u32? Can this cause issues on 32-bit vs 64-bit systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Clone Implementation] All structs derive Clone - can large Vec fields in DagHealthConfig cause expensive clones that degrade performance during config access? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [Debug Implementation] All structs derive Debug - can debug output accidentally expose sensitive config values in logs that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [All Structs] [PartialEq Implementation] Structs derive PartialEq for comparison - can floating point comparisons in backoff calculations cause PartialEq to behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Import: QuorumStoreConfig] [Dependency] The quorum_store field references QuorumStoreConfig from another module - can mismatches in config versions between modules cause deserialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Import: ChainHealthBackoffValues] [External Type] ChainHealthBackoffValues is defined elsewhere - can changes to that type's structure break DagHealthConfig deserialization without compile errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/dag_consensus_config.rs] [Import: PipelineBackpressureValues] [External Type] Similar to ChainHealthBackoffValues, can PipelineBackpressureValues changes cause runtime failures in DagHealthConfig? (Medium)"
