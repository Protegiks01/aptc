  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege escalation] Does the service drop privileges after initialization if started as root, or does it continue running with elevated privileges that could be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Resource limits] Does the service set resource limits (ulimit, rlimit) during startup to prevent resource exhaustion attacks, or can attackers consume unlimited memory/CPU/file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Bind address validation] Does the service validate that the gRPC listen addresses from config are appropriate and don't accidentally bind to public interfaces when only localhost is intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Supply chain attack] Are the dependencies (clap, tokio, anyhow, aptos-indexer-grpc-server-framework) pinned to specific versions, or can dependency confusion attacks inject malicious crates? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Transitive vulnerabilities] Have all transitive dependencies been audited for known CVEs, particularly in the tokio async runtime and jemalloc allocator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Dependencies] [Framework trust] Does the aptos-indexer-grpc-server-framework properly sanitize inputs before passing them to this service, or can framework-level vulnerabilities bypass main.rs security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Conditional Compilation] [Unix-specific attacks] Does the #[cfg(unix)] conditional create security gaps where non-Unix platforms lack jemalloc's security hardening, making them easier targets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Conditional Compilation] [Testing coverage] Are both Unix and non-Unix code paths equally tested for security vulnerabilities, or do platform-specific bugs exist in less-tested configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Async cancellation] If the await on args.run() is cancelled (e.g., via Ctrl+C), does the service properly clean up all spawned tasks, Redis connections, and file handles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Tokio scheduler] Does tokio's default multi-threaded scheduler introduce race conditions in global state initialization that could lead to data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Initialization timeout] Can slow config loading or Redis connection establishment cause the service to appear hung during startup, triggering unnecessary restarts in orchestration systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Fatal error handling] If args.run() returns a fatal error, does the process exit with an appropriate error code, or does it return success and confuse deployment systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Log injection] Can an attacker inject malicious data into log messages by manipulating command-line arguments, potentially exploiting log aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Sensitive data in logs] Does the setup_logging() call in the framework accidentally log sensitive configuration data (Redis passwords, TLS keys) during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Chain ID mismatch] Does the service validate that it's connecting to the correct Aptos chain (mainnet/testnet/devnet) before serving data, preventing accidental cross-chain data leakage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Version compatibility] Does the service check for version compatibility with the Aptos node and Redis cache format, or can version mismatches lead to transaction data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-data-service/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Consensus impact] If the indexer data service crashes or becomes unavailable, can this impact Aptos consensus or validator operation, potentially causing liveness issues? (Low)"
