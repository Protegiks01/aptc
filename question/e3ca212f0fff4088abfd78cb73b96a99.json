  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Runtime shutdown] If one runtime panics, does it properly shut down all other runtimes, or can zombie runtimes continue processing creating inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Configuration consistency] Can different components receive inconsistent views of node_config if it's modified during initialization, causing protocol violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Memory safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or transmutes hidden in the dependencies that could cause memory corruption during state sync operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Channel backpressure] Can notification channels become full causing senders to block indefinitely, creating deadlocks between mempool, consensus, and state sync? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Database consistency] With multiple clones of DbReaderWriter being used across components, can concurrent writes cause database corruption or lost updates? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Cross-function] [Component isolation] Are the different runtimes (data-client, stream-serv, stor-server) properly isolated, or can a compromised component access another's memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Input validation] [NodeConfig tampering] Can the NodeConfig parameter be manipulated after initial validation but before being used in component creation, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Input validation] [StateSyncConfig limits] Are state_sync_config buffer sizes and timeout values validated against safe ranges, or can extremely large/small values cause integer overflows or underflows? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Input validation] [Storage directory traversal] Does node_config.storage.dir() validation prevent directory traversal attacks where an attacker writes metadata to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Protocol] [Epoch transition handling] During epoch transitions, can state sync initialization cause missed reconfiguration events leading to validators operating in different epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/state_sync.rs] [Protocol] [Consensus notification timing] Can delays in setting up consensus_notifier cause consensus to commit blocks before state sync is ready, leading to state divergence? (Critical)",
