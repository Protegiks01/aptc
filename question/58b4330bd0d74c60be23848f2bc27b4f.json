  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Network Fallback Logic] If all chain ID checks at lines 40-43 fail, the code defaults to 'devnet' at line 45 - can this be exploited to force incorrect network selection for custom chain IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Conditional Execution Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the self.execute flag at line 66 through command line injection or other means to skip authorization checks before calling execute_past_transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Early Exit Bypass] Are there any early exit conditions between version lookup at line 52-56 and execution at line 66 where an attacker could cause the debugger to skip important validation steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Struct: Command] [Flag Manipulation] Can the execute boolean flag at line 15 be manipulated through environment variables or config files beyond command line args, potentially bypassing intended restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Debug Format String Injection] Can an attacker craft transaction data that when formatted with {:#?} at line 72 causes format string vulnerabilities or unexpected output parsing by downstream tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Signature Verification Bypass] Does the code verify the SignedTransaction signature after BCS deserialization at line 32, or can an attacker provide transactions with invalid signatures that still get processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Replay Attack] Can the same transaction bytes be submitted multiple times to this debugger, and does it check for replay protection, or can historical transactions be re-executed without proper nonce validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Chain ID Binding] Is the transaction's chain_id at line 33 cryptographically bound to its signature, or can an attacker take a valid transaction from testnet and replay it on mainnet by modifying chain_id? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Signature Malleability] Can an attacker manipulate the signature bytes within the SignedTransaction to create equivalent but different valid signatures, potentially causing signature malleability issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Timing Side Channel] Does the execution time of get_version_by_account_sequence at line 52-55 vary based on whether the account/sequence exists, potentially leaking information about transaction history? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Execution Timing Leak] Can an attacker use the execution timing of execute_past_transactions at line 74 with different concurrency levels to infer information about transaction complexity or state access patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Error Timing Differences] Do different error paths (BCS deserialization failure vs URL parse failure vs REST API error) have distinct timing characteristics that could be used for information gathering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [UTF-8 Validation] Is the buffer read from stdin at line 25 validated to be valid UTF-8 before regex processing, or can non-UTF-8 bytes cause panics in String operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-debugger/src/bcs_txn_decoder.rs] [Function: run()] [Newline Handling] Does read_line at line 25 properly handle different newline conventions (LF vs CRLF), or can this cause parsing inconsistencies across platforms? (Low)"
