  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_counts()] [Type Safety] Does get_sample_count() return a u64, and is the cast to f64 safe, or could there be type confusion issues if the Prometheus library changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_counts()] [Metric Bombing] Can an attacker inject millions of histogram metrics to cause CPU exhaustion during count aggregation, degrading validator performance? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_counts()] [Non-Histogram Metrics] What happens if non-histogram metrics are included in metric_families? Could this cause panics or undefined behavior when calling get_histogram()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_counts()] [Concurrent Modification] If metric_families is being modified by another thread during iteration, can this cause data races or incorrect count calculations? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [Overflow to Infinity] Can extremely large sample_sum values cause the accumulator to overflow to infinity, making telemetry calculations unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [NaN Propagation] If any histogram contains NaN sample_sum values, will this corrupt the entire sum calculation and propagate through telemetry systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [Negative Sum Injection] Can malicious actors inject negative sample_sum values that could misrepresent actual latencies or throughput metrics critical for consensus monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [Metric Type Validation] Does the function verify that metrics are histograms before calling get_histogram(), or could type confusion cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [Empty Metrics Handling] When metric_families is empty, does returning 0.0 correctly represent 'no data' versus 'zero sum', potentially causing misinterpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Function: sum_all_histogram_sums()] [Performance Attack] Can attackers include millions of histogram buckets to cause CPU exhaustion during sum aggregation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Module-level] [Unsafe Code] The file uses #![forbid(unsafe_code)] - but are there any indirect unsafe operations through the Prometheus or telemetry service dependencies that could introduce memory safety issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Module-level] [Dependency Vulnerabilities] Are the imported prometheus and aptos_telemetry_service crates regularly audited for vulnerabilities that could affect telemetry data integrity? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Constant: BUILD_CHAIN_ID] [Chain Identification] If BUILD_CHAIN_ID is used to route telemetry data, can manipulating this constant cause data to be sent to wrong networks or leaked to unintended recipients? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Module-level] [Telemetry Exfiltration] Can the telemetry functions be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive validator state information, private keys, or internal network topology data? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/utils.rs] [Module-level] [Rate Limiting] Are there any rate limits on telemetry event creation to prevent spam attacks that could overwhelm telemetry aggregation infrastructure? (Medium)",
