  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Location Inconsistency] Why does module_storage_error! (line 14) and module_linker_error! (line 32) use Location::Undefined while module_cyclic_dependency_error! (lines 46-48) uses Location::Module - could this inconsistency be exploited to bypass location-based access controls or error filtering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [PartialVMError Abuse] All three macros call .finish() to convert PartialVMError to VMError (lines 14, 32, 48) - can an attacker intercept or modify errors during this conversion to change error semantics before they reach consensus verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [StatusCode Injection] Could an attacker exploit macro hygiene issues to pass malicious StatusCode values (lines 8, 25, 40) that cause these macros to generate errors with incorrect severity or handling requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Memory Safety] Do all three macros properly handle the case where format!() panics due to out-of-memory conditions, or could OOM during error construction leave the VM in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Storage Backend Bypass] When module_storage_error! is invoked from storage implementations, does the error properly propagate through all caching layers, or can cached modules mask storage failures and serve stale/corrupted bytecode? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Dependency Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the linker error at lines 23-33 by publishing a malicious module with the same name as a missing dependency, causing the VM to load the attacker's module instead of failing gracefully? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Between when module_cyclic_dependency_error! detects a cycle and when the error is returned, can another thread modify the module dependency graph, causing the error to reference stale module information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Error Recovery Exploitation] If callers catch the VMError from module_storage_error! and retry the operation, can an attacker cause repeated storage errors that accumulate state changes before finally succeeding, violating atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Module Cache Poisoning] When module_linker_error! is triggered for a non-existent module, does the VM cache this negative result, and can an attacker exploit this to prevent legitimate modules with the same ID from being loaded later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Epoch Boundary Attack] Can an attacker time module publishing to occur during epoch transitions such that module_cyclic_dependency_error! is triggered on some validators but not others, causing consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Error Message Injection] Can the $addr or $name parameters contain newlines or ANSI escape codes that, when formatted into the error message at lines 11-12, corrupt log files or cause terminal injection when operators view error logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Hex Encoding Attack] Does the to_hex() call at line 29 properly validate that the address is valid before conversion, or can malformed addresses cause panics or incorrect hex representations that break error parsing tools? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [ModuleId Constructor Bypass] Can the ModuleId::new() call at line 47 fail or panic for certain address/name combinations, causing module_cyclic_dependency_error! to abort the VM instead of returning a proper error? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Macro Expansion Attack] Could an attacker exploit rust macro expansion rules to pass expressions with side effects as macro arguments (e.g., $addr that calls a function), causing unexpected code execution when the macro expands? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Error Serialization Exploit] When these VMErrors are serialized for transmission between validators, can the error message strings contain malicious payloads that exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in remote nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Storage Error Amplification] Can a single storage corruption event trigger module_storage_error! for multiple modules simultaneously, causing a cascade of error messages that overwhelm validator logging systems and mask the root cause? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Legacy Compatibility Exploit] Given the comment about 'legacy loader implementation' at lines 18-20, are there differences in error format between legacy and current implementations that could be exploited during protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Cycle Detection Evasion] Can an attacker structure module dependencies to create pseudo-cycles that don't trigger module_cyclic_dependency_error! during initial verification but cause infinite loops during actual module execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_storage_error!] [Transaction Rollback Failure] When module_storage_error! is raised during transaction execution, does the VM properly rollback all state changes, or can partial writes persist causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Module Existence Oracle] Can an attacker use module_linker_error! as an oracle to probe which system modules exist without paying gas, by crafting transactions that reference modules and checking whether linker errors occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_cyclic_dependency_error!] [Deadlock via Cyclic Dependencies] If module_cyclic_dependency_error! is triggered while holding locks on module cache entries, could the error handling path itself attempt to acquire the same locks, causing deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Error Propagation Race] When errors from these macros propagate through async execution contexts, can race conditions cause errors to be delivered to the wrong transaction, incorrectly failing valid transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [All Macros] [Double-Panic Vulnerability] If format!() or any other operation within these macros panics while the VM is already unwinding from another panic, can this cause a double-panic that crashes the validator node? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/types/src/code/errors.rs] [Macro: module_linker_error!] [Linker Error Gas Bypass] When module_linker_error! is invoked during dependency resolution, are gas costs properly attributed to the transaction that triggered module loading, or can attackers force expensive linker operations onto validators without payment?
