  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Struct: NodeIdentityChecker] [Clone safety] Is the Clone implementation for NodeIdentityCheckerConfig safe, or could shallow copying lead to shared mutable state vulnerabilities? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [REST client vulnerability] Are there known vulnerabilities in aptos_rest_client that could allow response spoofing or MITM attacks affecting the identity check? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [TLS verification bypass] Does the underlying REST client properly verify TLS certificates, or can an attacker MITM the connection to provide fake chain_id/role_type? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Insufficient validation] Does the checker only validate chain_id and node_role, ignoring other critical IndexResponse fields like epoch or ledger_version that could indicate consensus issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Baseline assumption] Does the code assume the baseline node is always honest? Could a compromised baseline cause all malicious nodes to pass validation? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [No threshold checking] Does the checker allow any single failure to result in score 0, or should there be threshold logic to handle transient errors more gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/node_identity.rs] [Function: check()] [Missing cryptographic verification] Does the identity check rely purely on self-reported values without cryptographic proof (signatures, merkle proofs) that the node belongs to the claimed chain?
