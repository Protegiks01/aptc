  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Chain ID Spoofing] Can a malicious API server return an incorrect chain_id (e.g., mainnet ID when client expects testnet) in the X_APTOS_CHAIN_ID header, causing the client to submit transactions to the wrong chain and potentially lose funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Integer Overflow] Does the chain_id parsing from string to u8 properly handle values > 255, or can an attacker provide a value like '256' that wraps around or causes unexpected behavior when cast to u8? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Chain ID Validation] Is there any validation that the parsed chain_id matches the expected network, or can a compromised API server silently switch the chain_id mid-session causing transaction replay across chains? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Struct: State] [Chain ID Range] Does the u8 type for chain_id properly restrict valid chain IDs, or could invalid chain IDs (e.g., 0, 255) be accepted and cause downstream validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Version Rollback] Can a malicious API server provide a lower version number than previously seen, causing the client to accept stale state and potentially submit transactions based on outdated ledger information? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Version Inconsistency] Is there validation that version >= oldest_ledger_version, or can an API server provide logically inconsistent version numbers that violate blockchain invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Version Jump Attack] Can an attacker provide an extremely large version number (e.g., u64::MAX) to cause clients to wait indefinitely for confirmations or make incorrect state assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Epoch Rollback] Can a compromised API server send a lower epoch number than previously observed, causing the client to accept outdated validator set information and potentially submit transactions that fail consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Epoch Overflow] Does the epoch parsing handle u64::MAX correctly, or can malicious servers provide overflow values that cause arithmetic errors in epoch-dependent logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Epoch-Version Consistency] Is there validation that epoch transitions occur at proper version boundaries, or can an API server provide an epoch number that doesn't match the version's actual epoch? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Struct: State] [Epoch State Attack] Can an attacker cause clients to use stale epoch information by manipulating the epoch field, leading to transactions being sent with incorrect validator expectations? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Timestamp Overflow] Does parsing X_APTOS_LEDGER_TIMESTAMP handle u64::MAX (microseconds since epoch), or can overflow values cause time calculations to wrap around and break expiration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Timestamp Future Attack] Can an API server provide timestamp_usecs far in the future, causing clients to incorrectly calculate transaction expirations or timeout values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rest-client/src/state.rs] [Function: from_headers()] [Timestamp-Version Consistency] Is there validation that timestamp increases monotonically with version, or can inconsistent timestamp/version pairs cause state inconsistency issues? (Medium)",
