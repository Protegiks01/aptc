  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [Address Validation] Does Object::new() validate that the inner AccountAddress represents a valid object address derived from proper GUID hashing, or can arbitrary addresses be wrapped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero Address] Can Object::new() be called with a zero AccountAddress (0x0), and would this create invalid object references that could cause undefined behavior in object operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: inner()] [Immutability Guarantee] Does inner() return an immutable reference to prevent callers from modifying the AccountAddress, or could unsafe code obtain mutable access and corrupt object addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Clone Semantics] Does the Clone implementation for Object properly handle address cloning, or could shallow copies lead to aliasing issues where multiple Object instances point to the same address? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Equality Semantics] Does the PartialEq implementation correctly compare object addresses, or could custom equality logic allow distinct objects to be treated as equal? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Type Confusion] Can Object instances wrapping the same AccountAddress but pointing to different object types (e.g., Token vs NFT) be confused, bypassing type-specific access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Address Collision] If two different objects are created with the same AccountAddress due to GUID generation bugs, can Object wrapper distinguish between them or would it enable double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Serialization] Does BCS serialization of Object properly encode the inner AccountAddress without loss of information or endianness issues across platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: inner()] [Reference Lifetime] Are there lifetime or borrow checker issues where inner() returns references that could outlive the Object instance, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: Object] [Memory Safety] Does the Object wrapper properly handle Drop semantics, or could premature dropping of Object instances leave dangling references to AccountAddress in other parts of the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectGroupResource] [Gas Calculation] Is the gas cost for storing and retrieving ObjectGroupResource properly calculated based on BTreeMap size, or could attackers exploit mispriced operations to exhaust validator resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Gas Underpricing] Are ObjectCoreResource operations properly metered for gas consumption, or could cheap operations that create expensive EventHandle state lead to DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Gas for Serialization] Does to_bytes() gas metering account for the computational cost of BCS serialization proportional to BTreeMap size, or is it constant-time priced? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: insert()] [Gas Per Operation] Is insert() gas cost calculated per-key-value-pair or per-operation, and could batching multiple inserts in one transaction bypass intended gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Deterministic Serialization] Do all BCS serialization operations produce identical byte output across different platforms, Rust versions, and endianness, ensuring consensus on state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Atomic Operations] When multiple fields of ObjectCoreResource or ObjectGroupResource are modified in a transaction, are the changes applied atomically or could partial updates lead to inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Concurrent Access] In parallel execution environments, are there proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions when multiple transactions access the same object resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Rollback Safety] If a transaction modifying these structs fails mid-execution, are all changes properly rolled back without leaving partially modified state in storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Merkle Proof Consistency] When these resources are stored in Jellyfish Merkle trees, do state proofs remain valid across validators even if internal BTreeMap ordering differs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All MoveStructType Implementations] [Type Registry] Are the MODULE_NAME and STRUCT_NAME constants properly registered in the Move VM's type registry, preventing type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All MoveResource Implementations] [Resource Semantics] Do the MoveResource trait implementations enforce Move's resource semantics (no copy, no drop without explicit handling) when these structs are manipulated in Rust? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Bytecode Verification] When Move bytecode attempts to access these resources, does the verifier properly check that the Rust-side struct definitions match Move-side type signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [All Structs] [Generic Type Parameters] If these structs were to support generic type parameters in the future, would the current implementation maintain type safety across the Rust-Move boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Empty State] How does to_bytes() handle ObjectGroupResource with an empty BTreeMap - does it serialize to zero bytes, and could this cause issues in storage or deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/object.rs] [Struct: ObjectCoreResource] [Max Field Values] What happens when guid_creation_num reaches u64::MAX - does the system gracefully handle this limit or could overflow cause undefined behavior? (High)"
