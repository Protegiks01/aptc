  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Function: load_from_file()] [Deserialization attack] Can an attacker craft a malicious JSON file with deeply nested objects or circular references that causes the serde_json deserializer to exhaust stack space, crashing the simulation session and causing validator node DoS? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-transaction-simulation-session/src/config.rs] [Struct: BaseState::Remote] [DNS rebinding] Can an attacker use a DNS rebinding attack where node_url initially resolves to a public IP during validation but later rebinds to internal IPs (127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8) to access internal services?
