  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: coordinator()] [Race condition] Can an attacker exploit the select_all() event multiplexing to cause race conditions between network_events from different networks, potentially allowing double-processing of the same transaction from multiple peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: coordinator()] [Event prioritization] Does the futures::select! macro provide any ordering guarantees, or can an attacker flood one event channel to starve other critical events like mempool_reconfig_events, causing validators to operate with stale configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: coordinator()] [State inconsistency] Can concurrent processing of client_events and quorum_store_requests on the same transaction lead to inconsistent mempool state where a transaction is both in the mempool and marked as committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: coordinator()] [Termination attack] Is there a way for an attacker to trigger the 'complete' branch by closing critical channels, causing the coordinator to terminate and halt all mempool operations leading to total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: coordinator()] [Race condition] Can scheduled_broadcasts.select_next_some() and handle_update_peers() race when both try to schedule broadcasts for the same peer, potentially causing duplicate broadcasts and wasting validator bandwidth?

  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/shared_mempool/coordinator.rs] [Function: spawn_commit_notification_handler()] [Race condition] Can there be a race between the spawned commit handler task accessing mempool.lock() and the main coordinator loop accessing the same mempool, causing deadlocks or inconsistent state?
