  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Cryptographic weakness] Can an attacker craft a malicious seed input that causes hash_to_curve to produce predictable or biased group elements g, h, or g_2, potentially compromising the PVSS scheme's security and enabling secret recovery attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Collision attack] Does the hash_to_curve implementation for g and h use sufficiently different domain separators to prevent collisions, or could an attacker find inputs where g equals h, violating the ElGamal encryption security assumption and breaking the entire PVSS protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Weak randomness] If an attacker controls or predicts the seed parameter passed to new_from_seed(), can they precompute the resulting public parameters to gain unfair advantage in DKG transcript generation or secret recovery? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Debug assertion bypass] The debug_assert_ne!(g, h) at line 41 only runs in debug builds - can this equality check be violated in release builds, potentially causing catastrophic cryptographic failures where g equals h breaks ElGamal encryption security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: new_from_seed()] [Domain separator reuse] Does using the same DST_PVSS_PUBLIC_PARAMS for all three hash_to_curve calls (g, h, g_2) with only different labels create cryptographic dependencies between the generated elements that could be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: default_with_bls_base()] [BLS key reuse] The function reuses BLS12-381 generator as g for encryption PKs - can this key reuse between consensus BLS signatures and ElGamal encryption create cross-protocol attacks where signing operations leak encryption key information? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: default_with_bls_base()] [Debug assertion bypass] The debug_assert_ne!(g, h) at line 58 only runs in debug mode - can hash_to_curve for h_with_bls_base accidentally produce the BLS generator, causing g to equal h in production and breaking encryption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: default_with_bls_base()] [Weak parameters] Does using G1Projective::generator() as the base g create known-plaintext vulnerabilities in ElGamal encryption since this generator is publicly known and standardized?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: default_with_bls_base()] [Label collision] Can the labels 'h_with_bls_base' and 'g_2_with_bls_base' collide with other hash_to_curve operations in the codebase, potentially causing unintended cryptographic relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Data corruption] Does the two-step serialization (enc.to_bytes() then g_2.to_compressed()) properly handle memory allocation failures that could cause partial or corrupted serialization leading to deserialization attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: to_bytes()] [Buffer overflow] Can appending g_2.to_compressed() to enc.to_bytes() cause unexpected behavior if the encryption public parameters size changes, potentially overflowing fixed-size buffers in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Invalid group elements] If the deserialization succeeds but produces group elements that are not on the correct subgroup or are points at infinity, can this cause cryptographic failures in PVSS operations without being detected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [Length validation bypass] The WrongLengthError check compares against NUM_BYTES constant - can an attacker craft byte arrays that pass this check but contain malformed data that corrupts the encryption parameters or g_2 element?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/das/public_parameters.rs] [Function: try_from()] [G2 decompression failure] If G2Projective::from_compressed() silently returns a None for invalid points instead of error, can attackers inject malformed parameters that appear valid but cause cryptographic operations to fail unpredictably? (High)",
