  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Configuration bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the NodeConfig parameter passed to handle_system_information_request() to bypass the expose_system_information check, potentially through race conditions during config hot-reload or memory corruption, enabling unauthorized system information disclosure on mainnet validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [TOCTOU race condition] Does the check of node_config.inspection_service.expose_system_information at line 16 suffer from a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use vulnerability where the config could be modified between the check and the actual data retrieval in get_system_information_json(), leaking system information even when disabled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Authorization bypass] Can concurrent requests to the system_information endpoint exploit race conditions in the config check to bypass the expose_system_information flag, where one thread disables the endpoint while another thread is processing a request? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Config validation] Is the NodeConfig parameter validated to ensure it hasn't been tampered with or deserialized from an untrusted source before checking expose_system_information, potentially allowing attacker-controlled config to always return true? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Ownership exploit] Since NodeConfig is passed by value (moved) at line 14, can an attacker exploit use-after-move or double-free vulnerabilities if the config is accessed elsewhere after being consumed by this function? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Information disclosure] Does the system information collected by aptos_telemetry::system_information::get_system_information() at line 34 expose sensitive data like exact CPU models, memory configurations, and disk layouts that could enable targeted attacks against known hardware vulnerabilities on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Reconnaissance attack] Can attackers use the exposed system information (CPU count, memory size, disk space) to fingerprint validator node hardware and identify which validators are running on cloud infrastructure versus bare metal, enabling targeted DDoS or infrastructure attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Hostname disclosure] Does the system information include the hostname (from system_host_name) that could reveal internal network topology, naming conventions, or organizational structure to attackers planning social engineering or infrastructure attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [OS fingerprinting] Does the exposed kernel version and OS version information enable attackers to identify unpatched systems with known vulnerabilities, facilitating remote code execution attempts on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Capacity analysis] Can attackers use the disk available space and total space information to determine when a validator node is running low on storage, potentially timing attacks to coincide with degraded node performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Git metadata exposure] Does the build_information!() macro at line 35 expose the exact git commit hash, branch name, and build timestamp that could reveal whether a validator is running a vulnerable version with known security issues, enabling targeted exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Version correlation attack] Can attackers correlate the exposed build_pkg_version, build_commit_hash, and build_time to identify validators running outdated versions during the window between a security patch release and validator upgrades, targeting vulnerable nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Development build detection] Does the build information expose whether the node is running a debug build (build_profile_name) or release build (build_is_release_build), allowing attackers to identify less secure development builds deployed in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Compiler metadata leak] Does exposing the Rust version (build_rust_version) and cargo version (build_cargo_version) enable attackers to identify builds compiled with vulnerable toolchains that might have introduced security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Branch information leak] Does the exposed git branch name reveal whether validators are running experimental features, staging branches, or main production code, allowing attackers to target nodes with less-tested code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [JSON injection] Can malicious system information values (e.g., manipulated hostname, CPU vendor strings) containing special JSON characters cause injection attacks when serialized by serde_json::to_string at line 38, potentially leading to parsing errors or data corruption in monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Serialization DoS] If the system information or build information contains extremely large data structures or deeply nested objects, can the serialization at line 38-40 consume excessive CPU/memory causing denial of service on the inspection service thread?
