  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Finalized vs pending overlap] Is there enforcement that a transaction cannot be in both pending and finalized sets simultaneously, or can this inconsistent state occur? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Block-STM violation] If the tracker incorrectly reports no conflicts between transactions that DO conflict, can this break Block-STM assumptions and cause non-deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Read-write conflicts] Does the tracker properly detect read-after-write conflicts, or only write-after-write conflicts, potentially missing RAW hazards? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Write-after-read conflicts] Can read transactions be finalized before write transactions to the same location are known, causing WAR conflicts in parallel execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Intra-round conflicts] While the tracker prevents cross-shard conflicts, can intra-shard conflicts within the same round still occur if the tracker is bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Dependency edges] If finalized_writes is corrupted or incomplete, will dependent edge calculations in add_edges phase create incorrect dependency graphs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: has_write_in_range()] [Maximum txn_id] When txn_id approaches usize::MAX, can arithmetic operations in range calculations overflow or wraparound incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: mark_txn_ordered()] [Maximum round_id] Can extremely large round_id values cause issues in ShardedTxnIndexV2 ordering comparisons or memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Function: has_write_in_range()] [Zero-length range] The test shows has_write_in_range(4,4) returns false - is this behavior correct for all edge cases or can it miss conflicts at exact txn boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Empty block] If a block has zero transactions, do trackers handle this gracefully or can empty pending sets cause division by zero or other errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Single transaction] If a block has only one transaction, do the range queries and conflict detection still work correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Maximum shards] Can the tracker handle the maximum possible number of shards, or will large shard_id values cause issues in range calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [RwLock wrapping] The tracker is wrapped in RwLock in PartitionState - can deadlocks occur if multiple threads acquire read locks and then try to upgrade to write locks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Lock ordering] If trackers for different storage locations are locked in different orders by different threads, can this cause deadlocks in the partitioning process? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Lock contention] For hot storage locations accessed by many transactions, can lock contention on the tracker's RwLock cause severe performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Atomic operations] The tracker uses BTreeSet operations which are not inherently atomic - can partial updates be visible to concurrent readers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Memory ordering] In multi-core execution, can different cores see different orderings of tracker updates due to weak memory model, causing inconsistent conflict detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Parallel iteration] The test uses into_par_iter in the partitioner - can parallel iteration over pending_writes in has_write_in_range race with concurrent modifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct derives] [Serialization determinism] The tracker derives Serialize/Deserialize - can BTreeSet serialization be non-deterministic across different Rust versions or platforms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct derives] [Clone semantics] The tracker derives Clone - can deep cloning of large BTreeSets cause performance issues or memory exhaustion during partitioning? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct derives] [Equality comparison] The tracker derives Eq/PartialEq - can two trackers with identical logical state be considered unequal due to BTreeSet internal structure differences? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Struct derives] [Debug output] The Debug derive could leak sensitive information about transaction patterns - can this enable privacy attacks or front-running? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [DashMap storage] Trackers are stored in DashMap in PartitionState - can concurrent DashMap operations race with tracker operations causing inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Pre-partition indices] The tracker uses PrePartitionedTxnIdx which maps to OriginalTxnIdx - can this indirection be exploited to cause transactions to be tracked under wrong indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Shard assignment] If start_txn_idxs_by_shard in PartitionState is incorrect, will has_write_in_range produce wrong results leading to missed conflicts? (Critical)"
