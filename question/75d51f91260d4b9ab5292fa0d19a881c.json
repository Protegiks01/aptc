  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Missing integrity checks] Are downloaded binaries verified against cryptographic hashes or signatures before installation, or can tampered binaries be installed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: build_updater()] [Checksum validation] Even if checksums are provided in GitHub releases, are they properly verified, or can an attacker who compromises the release also modify the checksums? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: execute()] [Binary signing] Are movefmt binaries code-signed by a trusted authority, and is this signature verified before execution to prevent tampering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_movefmt_path()] [Persistent misconfiguration] If an attacker sets FORMATTER_EXE_ENV to a malicious path, does this persist across sessions, allowing persistent compromise? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 55-63] [Regex capture group safety] If the regex pattern matching fails or captures unexpected groups, could this lead to out-of-bounds access or panic? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Lines: 56-57] [Unwrap safety] The regex unwrap() could panic if the regex pattern is invalid - is this pattern guaranteed to be valid at compile time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/update/movefmt.rs] [Function: get_update_info()] [None handling] When current_version is None, is this properly handled in all code paths, or could it cause null pointer dereference equivalent issues in comparisons? (Low)",
