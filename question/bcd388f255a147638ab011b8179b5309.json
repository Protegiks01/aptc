  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Access Control] Can a malicious validator manipulate the exclude_authors HashSet to exclude all honest validators from batch contribution, enabling them to monopolize payload selection and potentially censor transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: exclude_authors] [Consensus Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the exclude_authors field by continuously adding all honest validator authors to force the system to only accept payloads from Byzantine validators, breaking consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: minimum_batch_age_usecs] [Integer Overflow] Can setting minimum_batch_age_usecs to u64::MAX cause integer overflow when compared with current timestamps, resulting in all batches being rejected and causing total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: minimum_batch_age_usecs] [Timing Attack] Can a malicious validator set minimum_batch_age_usecs to zero to bypass age verification entirely, allowing them to include unvalidated or malicious batches that haven't reached sufficient propagation across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: minimum_batch_age_usecs] [Liveness Attack] Can an attacker set minimum_batch_age_usecs to an extremely high value (e.g., days in microseconds) to effectively block all batch selection, causing permanent consensus halt and total loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Trait: Clone on OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Resource Exhaustion] Since OptQSPayloadPullParams implements Clone, can repeated cloning of large exclude_authors HashSets lead to memory exhaustion attacks when passed through multiple consensus layers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: exclude_authors] [State Inconsistency] Can race conditions during concurrent modifications to the exclude_authors HashSet cause different validators to have inconsistent views of excluded authors, leading to non-deterministic payload selection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Struct: OptQSPayloadPullParams] [Validation Gap] Is there any validation that exclude_authors doesn't contain the current proposer's author, which could lead to self-exclusion and inability to propose valid blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_poll_time] [Timing Attack] Can a Byzantine validator set max_poll_time to Duration::ZERO to force immediate payload pulls without waiting for sufficient transaction propagation, potentially causing empty blocks and reducing throughput? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_poll_time] [Liveness Attack] Can setting max_poll_time to Duration::MAX cause the payload pulling process to hang indefinitely, blocking consensus progress and causing validator timeouts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns] [Resource Exhaustion] Can a malicious validator set max_txns to PayloadTxnsSize with count=u64::MAX and bytes=u64::MAX to trigger memory allocation failures or integer overflows in downstream payload processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns] [Integer Overflow] When max_txns.count() and max_txns.size_in_bytes() are used in arithmetic operations with other limits, can overflow occur leading to accepting more transactions than the system can handle? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns_after_filtering] [Validation Gap] Can max_txns_after_filtering be set to a value less than soft_max_txns_after_filtering, creating an inconsistent state where soft limits exceed hard limits and breaking filtering logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_txns_after_filtering] [Integer Overflow] Can setting max_txns_after_filtering to u64::MAX cause overflow when this value is used in comparisons or additions with payload sizes during filtering operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Fields: max_txns_after_filtering vs soft_max_txns_after_filtering] [Logic Error] Is there proper validation ensuring max_txns_after_filtering >= soft_max_txns_after_filtering, or can inverted values cause the filtering logic to accept all transactions regardless of limits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: soft_max_txns_after_filtering] [Consensus Bypass] Can a malicious validator set soft_max_txns_after_filtering to zero to bypass soft limit checks entirely while keeping hard limits high, potentially causing validator state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_inline_txns] [Resource Exhaustion] Can setting max_inline_txns to extreme values (either very high or zero) break the balance between inline and referenced transactions, causing memory exhaustion or network bandwidth issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: max_inline_txns] [Validation Gap] Is there validation that max_inline_txns <= max_txns, or can having inline limits exceed total limits create logical inconsistencies in payload construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter] [Filter Bypass] Can a malicious validator craft a PayloadFilter::Empty filter to bypass all transaction filtering, allowing inclusion of duplicate transactions or transactions that should have been excluded? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter] [State Inconsistency] If user_txn_filter contains PayloadFilter::DirectMempool with manipulated TransactionSummary entries, can this cause different validators to filter different transactions, leading to non-deterministic block contents? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: user_txn_filter] [Memory Exhaustion] Can a PayloadFilter::InQuorumStore with an extremely large HashSet of BatchInfoExt entries cause memory exhaustion when cloned and processed across multiple consensus rounds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: pending_ordering] [Consensus Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator flip pending_ordering between true/false to manipulate whether the system returns empty payloads or waits for full blocks, disrupting consensus timing and potentially causing forks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: pending_ordering] [Liveness Attack] Can setting pending_ordering=true combined with specific values of recent_max_fill_fraction and pending_uncommitted_blocks force the system to always return empty payloads, halting transaction processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: pending_uncommitted_blocks] [Integer Overflow] Can pending_uncommitted_blocks be set to usize::MAX causing overflow in comparisons with pending block thresholds, potentially bypassing wait-for-full-blocks logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/payload_pull_params.rs] [Field: pending_uncommitted_blocks] [Validation Gap] Is there validation that pending_uncommitted_blocks accurately reflects the actual number of pending blocks, or can mismatches cause incorrect decisions about returning empty vs full payloads? (Medium)"
