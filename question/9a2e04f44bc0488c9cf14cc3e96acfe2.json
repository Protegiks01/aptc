  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: ark_inverse_internal macro] [Cross-session handle reuse] Handles are stored in AlgebraContext which is SessionListener that clears on session start - but if session IDs wrap around or session start isn't called, could handles from previous sessions remain accessible, causing stale data usage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: ark_inverse_internal macro] [Session memory reset] AlgebraContext.bytes_used is reset to 0 on session start at line 195 - if reset fails or isn't called between transactions, could memory accounting become incorrect, allowing memory limit bypass across session boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: inv_internal] [Context extension isolation] AlgebraContext is stored in SafeNativeContext extensions - if multiple concurrent sessions share the same context extensions HashMap, could cross-session contamination occur where one session's handles become visible to another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: ark_inverse_internal macro] [Transaction boundary consistency] If a transaction aborts after inv_internal succeeds but before commit, are handles and AlgebraContext state properly rolled back, or could partially-created handles leak into subsequent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: inv_internal] [Speculative execution handling] In Block-STM parallel execution, transactions are speculatively executed and may abort - if inv_internal is called during speculative execution that later aborts, does AlgebraContext properly discard the speculative handles, or could they persist? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: ark_inverse_internal macro] [Inverse of one] When computing inverse of multiplicative identity (one), the result should be one itself - but if arkworks optimization shortcuts this case incorrectly, could inverse(1) return wrong value, breaking subsequent multiplications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/arithmetics/inv.rs] [Function: inv_internal] [Generator inverse] For cyclic groups, if inverse of a generator is computed and later used in discrete log protocols, could using generator^(-1) instead of generator break security assumptions of protocols like Schnorr signatures or Diffie-Hellman? (Low)"
