  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: add_module_write_ops()] [Panic on deletion] The assert_some! will panic if a module deletion is attempted - is this panic properly handled in the genesis context, or could it leave validators in an inconsistent state requiring manual intervention? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: add_module_write_ops()] [ModuleWrite validation] Does add_module_write_ops() verify that the ModuleWrite wraps a valid module WriteOp and not a resource or other state type, preventing type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: add_module_write_ops()] [Concurrent modifications] If add_module_write_ops() is called concurrently from different threads during genesis setup, could race conditions in HashMap insertion lead to some modules being silently dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: add_module_write_ops()] [Write op size] Is there any validation of the write operation bytes size, or can extremely large write ops (gigabytes) be inserted to exhaust validator memory during genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: add_module_write_ops()] [StateKey uniqueness] Does the function verify that all StateKeys in the BTreeMap are unique module paths, or could duplicate keys in the input lead to unexpected overwrite behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [State poisoning] Can get_state_value() be exploited to return corrupted StateValues that bypass MoveVM validation, allowing malicious bytecode to execute during genesis transaction processing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [StateValue construction] Does StateValue::new_legacy() properly validate the input bytes, or can malformed Bytes cause the StateValue to contain invalid data that crashes the MoveVM or consensus layer? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Bytes copy] Does Bytes::copy_from_slice() guarantee that the returned StateValue is independent from the internal state_data HashMap, or could modifications to the StateValue corrupt the genesis state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [None return] When get_state_value() returns None for non-existent StateKeys, does the caller properly handle this case, or could it lead to modules being skipped during genesis initialization causing incomplete framework deployment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [HashMap access] Is the HashMap::get() operation atomic and thread-safe during concurrent genesis operations, or could race conditions cause get_state_value() to return stale or inconsistent data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Memory clone] Does the copy_from_slice operation properly handle large module blobs, or could memory allocation failures during cloning lead to corrupted StateValues being returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Legacy format] Does StateValue::new_legacy() use a deprecated format that could cause compatibility issues with newer storage systems or introduce security vulnerabilities from legacy code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Error handling] The function returns Result but never returns Err - could this API mismatch cause calling code to improperly handle genesis state access failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [StateKey verification] Does get_state_value() verify that the requested StateKey is appropriate for genesis context, or can callers request non-module state that shouldn't exist during genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Storage accounting] Does returning StateStorageUsage::zero() during genesis bypass critical storage accounting, potentially allowing unlimited state growth without proper gas charges in genesis transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Resource metering] Can the zero storage usage be exploited to bypass storage rent or gas mechanics during genesis transaction execution, allowing attackers to create unlimited resources without cost? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Metering bypass] Does get_usage() returning zero cause the gas metering system to malfunction during genesis, potentially allowing infinite loops or resource exhaustion in genesis transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Post-genesis transition] After genesis completes, is there proper validation that storage usage transitions from zero to the actual state size, or could this mismatch cause Merkle tree or state commitment issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Function: get_usage()] [Economic model] Does the zero storage usage during genesis properly integrate with Aptos's economic model, or could it create opportunities for economic exploits during the genesis phase? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Determinism] Do all validators execute the exact same sequence of add_module() and add_module_write_ops() calls, or could differences in genesis script execution lead to divergent genesis states causing immediate chain split? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Genesis ordering] Is the order of module insertion deterministic and consistent across all validators, or could HashMap's non-deterministic iteration order cause validators to have identical modules but different state commitment hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [State commitment] After all modules are inserted into GenesisStateView, how is the initial Merkle tree root computed, and can attackers manipulate this root to cause consensus failures or enable fraud proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Framework completeness] Is there validation that all required framework modules (governance, stake, coin, account) are present in the genesis state, or could missing critical modules cause the blockchain to be non-functional at launch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Module dependencies] Does genesis initialization verify that module dependencies are satisfied (e.g., stake depends on coin), or could incorrect dependency ordering cause MoveVM to fail during genesis transaction execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/vm-genesis/src/genesis_context.rs] [Integration] [Genesis transactions] After GenesisStateView is populated with modules, how are genesis transactions executed, and can attackers inject malicious transactions that exploit the privileged genesis context? (Critical)"
