  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::new()] [Missing bounds validation] Can an attacker create an AggregatorResource where value > max_value during initialization, allowing them to bypass limit checks and potentially mint unlimited tokens or corrupt supply tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::new()] [Integer overflow] Can max_value be set to 0 or u128::MAX causing overflow conditions when the aggregator is used for arithmetic operations in coin supply tracking, leading to fund creation or destruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::new()] [Type safety violation] Since new() accepts generic type T without trait bounds, can an attacker pass non-numeric types that break invariants when used with fungible assets, causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::new()] [Negative values] If T is a signed integer type, can negative values for value or max_value be used to bypass validation in downstream code that assumes positive values for token supplies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::new()] [State inconsistency] Can two AggregatorResources with different max_value limits be created for the same logical resource, allowing attackers to exploit inconsistencies during state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [No bounds checking] The set() method directly assigns value without checking against max_value - can an attacker call this to set value beyond the limit, enabling unlimited token minting or supply manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [Concurrent modification race] Without synchronization primitives, can concurrent calls to set() from different transactions in parallel execution create race conditions leading to lost updates or incorrect final values? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [Atomicity violation] Does set() provide atomic guarantees, or can partial updates during validator crashes lead to inconsistent aggregator states across the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [Missing validation] Can set() be called with values that violate system invariants (e.g., setting coin supply to exceed total possible supply), causing economic exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [Access control bypass] Since set() is public, can any code path including untrusted smart contracts directly modify aggregator values, bypassing Move's resource safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::set()] [Type coercion attack] Can attackers exploit Rust's type system to call set() with incompatible types through unsafe code or FFI, corrupting the aggregator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::get()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Can an attacker exploit the gap between get() returning a reference and subsequent validation, modifying the value concurrently to bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::get()] [Reference lifetime violation] Does returning &T allow callers to hold references across transaction boundaries, potentially creating dangling pointers or use-after-free conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Function: AggregatorResource::get()] [Information leakage] Can get() expose internal state during parallel execution that allows frontrunning attacks or information extraction about pending transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [Missing invariant enforcement] The struct has no invariant checking that value <= max_value - can deserialization or direct field manipulation create invalid states that violate system assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [Serialization attack] Can malicious serialized data bypass constructor validation and create AggregatorResource instances with value > max_value when deserialized from storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [Generic type exploitation] Without trait bounds on T, can non-Copy types cause unexpected behavior, or can ZSTs (zero-sized types) break size assumptions in storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [State transition integrity] When used for coin supply in ConcurrentFungibleBalanceResource, can aggregator modifications occur outside proper transaction boundaries, violating atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorResource] [Missing overflow protection] Does the struct provide any overflow protection for T when used with numeric types, or can arithmetic operations cause wrapping/panicking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorSnapshotResource] [Public field exposure] The value field is public - can untrusted code directly modify snapshot values, creating inconsistencies between snapshots and actual aggregator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorSnapshotResource] [Snapshot consistency] Can snapshots become stale or inconsistent with the source aggregator during parallel execution, leading to double-spending or incorrect balance calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorSnapshotResource] [No validation] Since there's no validation logic, can snapshots be created with arbitrary values that don't correspond to any real aggregator state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorSnapshotResource] [Type mismatch] Can snapshots be created with type parameter T different from the source aggregator's type, causing type confusion vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: AggregatorSnapshotResource] [Serialization bypass] Can malicious serialized AggregatorSnapshotResource instances inject false snapshot data into the blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/aggregator.rs] [Struct: DerivedStringSnapshotResource] [Padding exploitation] The padding Vec<u8> field has no size limits - can attackers create snapshots with arbitrarily large padding to exhaust storage or cause DoS? (Medium)"
