  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Function: random_g1_points()] [Duplicate Points] Is there any check for duplicate G1 points in the vector, or could hash_to_curve collisions (however unlikely) create duplicates that break multi-signature security? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_points()] [Extreme Performance DoS] Each G2 point takes 150 microseconds - n=1000 points takes 150 milliseconds, could this be weaponized to completely halt validator operations and cause loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/random.rs] [Function: random_g2_points()] [Massive Memory Consumption] G2 points are 96 bytes each - n=10^6 requires 96MB, easily exploitable for memory exhaustion attacks if n is not bounded, is there validation? (High)",
