  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Event emission] When ValidatorConfig changes, are proper events emitted, and can lack of events cause monitoring systems to miss critical validator configuration changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Struct: ValidatorConfig] [Transaction validation] Can transactions that update ValidatorConfig bypass gas metering for deserialization operations, allowing attackers to cause expensive operations without paying appropriate gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Point compression] If BLS public keys use point compression, can decompression failures or ambiguities during deserialization cause validators to have different interpretations of the same key bytes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Key malleability] Can the same logical BLS public key be represented in multiple binary forms, allowing an attacker to create distinct ValidatorConfig entries that represent the same validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/validator_config.rs] [Field: consensus_public_key] [Batch verification] If BLS signatures from multiple validators are batch-verified, can one invalid consensus_public_key in ValidatorConfig cause the entire batch verification to fail, breaking consensus? (High)"
