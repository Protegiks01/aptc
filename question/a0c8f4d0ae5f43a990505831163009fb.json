  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Function: pluralize()] [UTF-8 boundary violation] Can an attacker provide a malicious Move source file with multi-byte UTF-8 characters ending in 'y' that causes the string slice operation `s[0..s.len() - 1]` to split a multi-byte character, resulting in invalid UTF-8 and potential panic or memory corruption during error message generation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Function: pluralize()] [Logic error] Does the pluralization logic correctly handle edge cases like strings ending in 'y' with length 1 (e.g., \\",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Function: pluralize()] [Denial of service] If `pluralize()` is called in a hot path during Move module compilation and an attacker submits many modules with identifiers requiring pluralization, does the repeated string allocation and concatenation create performance degradation that could slow down validator node compilation of on-chain Move code upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Function: pluralize()] [Locale handling] Does the English-only pluralization logic (adding 's' or 'ies') cause incorrect error messages or type checking failures when Move source files contain non-English identifiers, potentially affecting international developers and causing confusion in error reporting?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Function: ith_str()] [Logic correctness] Are there any callers in the model builder that could pass incorrect index values to `ith_str()`, such as 0-based indices instead of 1-based, causing panics during legitimate Move module compilation and creating a denial of service?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Module: model_builder] [Access control] Is `model_builder` marked as `pub(crate)` to prevent external access, or could attackers using malicious build dependencies gain access to the model builder internals and manipulate the global model state during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Module: module_builder] [Access control] Does the `pub(crate)` visibility of `module_builder` adequately protect against external manipulation, or could compromised proc-macros or build scripts in the dependency tree access and corrupt the module building process?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Integration] [Error message injection] If `pluralize()` and `ith_str()` are used to construct error messages that are displayed to users or logged, could an attacker craft Move identifiers with special characters or escape sequences that inject malicious content into error messages, potentially enabling log injection or XSS in block explorers?

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/src/builder/mod.rs] [Integration] [Deterministic compilation] Do the string formatting functions `pluralize()` and `ith_str()` produce deterministic output across all validator nodes, or could locale settings, Unicode normalization differences, or string library versions cause different error messages and potentially affect consensus if error handling influences type checking results?
