  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for EmployeePool] [Validator Conversion Failure] Can EmployeePoolConfig::try_from() at line 669 fail silently on validator conversion errors, creating pools with incomplete validator configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Vec<EmployeePool>] [Empty Employee Pool] Does validation prevent employee pools with empty accounts vector, which could create validator-only pools without actual employees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Function: try_from() for Vec<EmployeePool>] [Vesting Period Validation] Is there validation that vesting_schedule_numerators has at least one element, or can empty vectors cause index out of bounds at line 564? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Cross-Validation] [Total Supply Consistency] Is there validation that sum(AccountBalanceMap balances) + sum(ValidatorConfiguration stakes) + sum(EmployeePool allocations) equals total_supply, or can genesis create more tokens than specified? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Cross-Validation] [Validator Set Size] Is there a maximum limit on the number of validators in Layout.users, or can thousands of validators be added causing consensus performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Cross-Validation] [Employee-Validator Overlap] Can employee accounts in EmployeePoolConfig also appear as validator owners/operators in ValidatorConfiguration, creating conflicting role assignments? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-genesis/src/config.rs] [Serialization] [Large Collection Attack] Can extremely large vectors in Layout.users or EmployeePoolMap.inner cause memory exhaustion during deserialization, preventing genesis completion? (Medium)",
