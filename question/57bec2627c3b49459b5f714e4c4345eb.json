  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Integration] [Network partition] If validators disagree on `randomness_enabled()` check (line 200) due to config inconsistencies, can the network split into validators running DKG and those not participating? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Integration] [Reliable broadcast safety] ReliableBroadcast (lines 208-220) assumes all participants agree on the validator set. Can epoch transition timing windows cause some validators to use old validator sets in RB protocol? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Integration] [Cryptographic consistency] DKG uses both consensus_sk (line 238) and public keys from epoch_state. Can mismatches between these key sources compromise DKG security or cause protocol failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Epoch transition timing attack] Can an attacker time RPC messages (processed at line 135) to arrive exactly during `shutdown_current_processor()` execution (line 264), causing messages to be forwarded to a DKG manager that's shutting down? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Validator removal attack] If a validator is removed from the validator set mid-epoch, can they continue to receive DKG messages via their still-active network connections and disrupt the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Key storage poisoning] Can an attacker who gains access to the PersistentSafetyStorage (line 62) replace the consensus secret key to make a validator participate in DKG with a known private key, compromising future randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Channel overflow DoS] Can Byzantine validators flood the dkg_rpc_msg_rx channel (capacity 100, line 230) with 100 malicious messages at epoch start, preventing honest validators' messages from reaching DKG manager? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Randomness override exploitation] Can a coordinated attack where >1/3 validators set high `randomness_override_seq_num` values disable network-wide randomness generation, breaking applications that depend on on-chain randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Forged in_progress_session] Can an attacker who compromises on-chain DKGState storage inject a malicious `in_progress_session` (line 254) that causes honest validators to complete a DKG with attacker-known keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Shutdown acknowledgment DoS] Can a malicious DKG manager delay sending shutdown acknowledgment (line 274) to intentionally prevent the validator from transitioning to new epochs, causing loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Config desync attack] Can Byzantine validators propose on-chain configs that parse differently on different validator implementations, causing validators to disagree on whether DKG should run (line 200)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Event injection amplification] Can an attacker who controls event notification system inject multiple DKGStartEvent notifications to cause validators to initiate redundant DKG sessions, wasting resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Network sender amplification] Since `create_network_sender()` (line 278) returns cloneable senders, can these be exfiltrated and used by non-validators to spam the DKG network? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero validator set] If ValidatorSet extraction at line 158-160 succeeds but contains zero validators, can the empty EpochState cause panics in subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Single validator network] In a single-validator network, can DKG protocol deadlock when ReliableBroadcast expects messages from other participants (line 208-220)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Rapid epoch changes] If epochs change faster than DKG sessions can complete, can overlapping DKG managers interfere with each other's network messages or vtxn_pool state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [my_index is always None] If the validator's address never appears in any validator set (line 164-168), will the validator silently skip DKG forever, potentially accepting blocks with randomness it didn't participate in generating? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Consensus config missing] If `payload.get::<OnChainConsensusConfig>()` always fails (line 192), will all validators operating with default config cause unexpected protocol behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Both feature flags false] If both `is_vtxn_enabled()` and `randomness_enabled()` return false (line 199-200), validators skip DKG. Can the network function correctly without randomness if some applications expect it? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Channel at capacity] If dkg_rpc_msg_rx channel is at capacity 100 (line 230) when a critical message arrives, does the push at line 102 block, drop the message, or return an error? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Oneshot already closed] If `dkg_manager_close_tx` is taken (line 271) but the receiver end is already closed, does the send at line 273 panic or return an error? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty subscribed_events] If EventNotification at line 113 contains an empty `subscribed_events` array, does the function return Ok(()) without processing anything, potentially missing DKG start signals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Edge Case] [Negative or overflow epoch] If on-chain epoch numbers overflow or have arithmetic errors, can epoch comparisons at line 99 fail, allowing wrong-epoch messages to be processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Arc reference cycles] Multiple Arc-wrapped values are passed to DKGManager (lines 245-250). Can circular references prevent proper cleanup when epochs transition, causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/dkg/src/epoch_manager.rs] [Rust-Specific] [Async task lifetime] The tokio::spawn at line 253 creates a task with 'static lifetime. Can the task outlive the EpochManager itself, accessing deallocated memory? (Critical)"
