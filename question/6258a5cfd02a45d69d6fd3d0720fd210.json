  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_module_id()] [Null Address Attack] Can an attacker use AccountAddress::ZERO (0x0) as a module address to exploit boundary conditions between special and non-special address handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalContext.visited] [BTreeMap Capacity Attack] Can an attacker submit transactions that cause the BTreeMap to reserve but not use capacity, wasting memory and causing validators to allocate inefficiently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: push_next_ids_to_visit()] [Empty Iterator Edge Case] Does the function handle empty iterators correctly, or can passing an empty iterator cause unexpected behavior or skip validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: check_visited_impl()] [Error Message Length Attack] Can an attacker craft extremely long module addresses or names that cause the format!() to allocate large strings, contributing to memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Struct: TraversalStorage] [Arena Fragmentation] Can alternating allocations to different arenas cause memory fragmentation that degrades validator performance over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/module_traversal.rs] [Function: visit_if_not_special_address()] [Tuple Ordering Attack] Can an attacker exploit the BTreeMap tuple ordering ((AccountAddress, IdentStr)) to cause pathological search behavior by crafting specific address-name combinations? (Medium)"
