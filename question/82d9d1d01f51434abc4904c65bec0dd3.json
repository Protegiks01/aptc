  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: start()] [Error recovery] Line 234's recv() loop has no error handling - if channel disconnects unexpectedly, does the thread exit silently, or is there any notification mechanism to detect and restart the receiver? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: set_state_value()] [None value semantics] Line 48 allows setting state_value to None - can this be exploited to make existing state disappear, and is there proper differentiation between 'key doesn't exist' vs 'key exists with empty value'? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [None return semantics] Lines 66 returns Ok(None) if key not in cache - does this mean 'not cached yet' or 'confirmed to not exist', and can confusion between these cases cause incorrect transaction execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [StateValue validation] Line 64 returns StateValue without any validation - can oversized, malformed, or malicious StateValues cause downstream Move VM crashes, gas calculation errors, or type safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: init_for_block()] [Metrics leakage] Lines 120-122 increment metrics with state_keys.len() - can observing metric patterns reveal information about transaction contents, account accesses, or execution patterns to attackers monitoring metrics endpoints? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value() TStateView impl] [Timing side channel] Lines 190-193 vs 196-203 have different timer labels (prefetch_wait vs non_prefetch_wait) - can timing analysis reveal which state keys were predictable vs accessed randomly, leaking transaction pattern information? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: handle_message()] [Response timing] Lines 248-250 time kv_responses - can coordinator observe these metrics via response timing to infer processing load, thread pool saturation, or validator computational capacity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: insert_keys_and_fetch_values()] [Batch boundary] Line 137 chunks requests by REMOTE_STATE_KEY_BATCH_SIZE - can carefully crafted state_keys counts (e.g., 201 keys) cause unequal batches where the last batch gets different priority treatment from coordinator? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: insert_keys_and_fetch_values()] [Chunk iteration] Lines 136-144 use chunks().map().for_each() - can this create temporary allocations for all chunks before spawning tasks, causing memory spikes with large state_keys vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Constant: REMOTE_STATE_KEY_BATCH_SIZE] [Batch size mismatch] Line 27 sets batch size to 200 but no validation that coordinator respects this - can coordinator send responses in different batch sizes causing processing inefficiencies or missing state values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Cross-shard deadlock] If shard A needs state from shard B and B needs state from A, and both call get_state_value() blocking on RemoteStateValue.get_value(), can this create circular dependencies causing inter-shard deadlocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: pre_fetch_state_values()] [Prefetch coordination] Line 123 prefetches state_keys but there's no coordination between shards - can shard ordering dependencies cause some shards to wait indefinitely for state that depends on their own execution results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Struct: RemoteStateViewClient] [Shard initialization] Multiple shards initialize independently with coordinator_address - if one shard's coordinator is malicious but others are honest, can partial Byzantine behavior cause only some shards to diverge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: send_state_value_request()] [Send failure] Line 179 unwraps sender.send() assuming it always succeeds - if network channel is full or disconnected, will this panic crash the requesting thread and prevent state fetches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: start()] [Receive failure] Line 234 uses recv() which blocks forever - if channel is closed by coordinator disconnect, does this return Err causing clean thread exit, or does handling need to be added? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: send_state_value_request()] [No retry logic] Lines 172-179 send request once with no retry mechanism - if network message is lost, will the RemoteStateValue wait forever causing transaction execution to hang indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: handle_message()] [No deduplication] No request ID tracking means duplicate requests can be sent, but are duplicate responses handled safely, or can this cause set_state_value() race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: new() RemoteStateViewClient] [Thread pool sharing] Lines 84-89 create dedicated thread pool for this client - with multiple shards, does each get its own pool, and can total threads exceed system limits causing thread creation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: insert_keys_and_fetch_values()] [Thread pool saturation] Lines 141-143 spawn tasks without checking pool capacity - can submitting more tasks than pool threads cause work queue buildup and unbounded memory growth in the work queue? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: handle_message()] [Thread pool spawn] Line 237 spawns work for every message - if coordinator floods with messages, can this saturate the thread pool preventing prefetch requests from being sent, creating a deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: pre_fetch_state_values()] [Nested spawns] Line 168 spawns work that calls insert_keys_and_fetch_values() which spawns more work - can this create exponential task explosion exhausting thread pool resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: new() RemoteStateViewClient] [Channel types] Lines 93-95 create channels via network_controller - are these bounded or unbounded channels, and if unbounded, can flooding cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: send_state_value_request()] [Channel cloning] Line 140 clones sender Arc for each batch - with thousands of batches, can Arc clone/drop overhead cause performance degradation or memory fragmentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Struct: RemoteStateValueReceiver] [Single receiver] Only one receiver thread per shard on line 104-107 - if message processing is slow, can this become a bottleneck causing all state fetches to queue up indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/remote_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Read lock holding] Line 187 acquires read lock and holds it across RemoteStateValue.get_value() blocking call on line 203 - can this prevent init_for_block() from acquiring write lock causing deadlock?
