  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Blob Management] [Orphan Blobs] If blob upload succeeds but metadata update fails, can this create orphaned blobs that are never referenced, wasting storage and complicating cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Blob Management] [Storage Quotas] Are there quotas or limits on cloud storage usage, and can an attacker intentionally exhaust storage by uploading excessive blobs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Blob Management] [Naming Conflicts] Can generate_blob_name() produce naming conflicts if called with non-standard version values, causing data loss through overwrites? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Testing] [Edge Case Coverage] The test on lines 61-79 only verifies blob naming format - are there tests for error handling, concurrent access, invalid metadata, and overflow conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Testing] [Boundary Conditions] Does the test verify behavior at u64::MAX (line 76-78), but are there tests for what happens when operations near this limit cause overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Testing] [Malformed Input] Are there tests for how functions handle malformed JSON, corrupted blobs, or invalid cloud storage responses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Attack Vector] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay old metadata updates to cause indexers to reprocess historical transactions, potentially causing duplicate entries or state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Attack Vector] [Deletion Attack] Can an attacker with storage access delete metadata or blobs to cause indexer failures or force reprocessing of large transaction ranges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Attack Vector] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker rapidly trigger metadata uploads to exhaust cloud storage API quotas or rate limits, causing legitimate indexer operations to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Attack Vector] [Metadata Poisoning] If multiple indexers write metadata simultaneously without coordination, can this lead to metadata poisoning where inconsistent states propagate across the system? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/storage.rs] [Attack Vector] [Time-Based Attack] Can an attacker exploit timing windows between blob upload and metadata update to cause indexers to read incomplete or inconsistent data? (High)"
