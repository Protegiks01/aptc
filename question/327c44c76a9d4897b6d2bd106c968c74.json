  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [txn_executor validation] Does the txn_executor parameter (line 30, 46, 73) validate transaction execution results, or can failed transactions be silently ignored leading to incomplete workflow setup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [root_account mutation] Can multiple concurrent construct_workflow calls mutate the root_account state (lines 29, 45, 72) causing sequence number conflicts or balance depletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Trait: WorkflowKind] [Lifetime safety] Does the async_trait macro (line 23) properly handle lifetimes for references to root_account and txn_executor (lines 29-30), or can dangling references occur if these are dropped during await? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Box trait object safety] Are the Box<dyn UserModuleTransactionGenerator> objects (lines 55-62) guaranteed to be Send + Sync, or can thread-unsafe workers cause panics in async execution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-workloads-lib/src/token_workflow.rs] [Function: construct_workflow()] [Match exhaustiveness] Does the match on line 34 handle all possible TokenWorkflowKind variants, or can adding new variants cause unhandled cases that panic at runtime? (Low)",
