  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/events.rs] [Function: from_event()] [Version mismatch] Can transaction_version and transaction_block_height parameters be inconsistent (e.g., version from block N but height from block M), causing cross-referenced queries to return incorrect results? (High)",
