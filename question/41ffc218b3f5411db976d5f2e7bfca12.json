  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Tool] [Access Control] Does the Tool enum enforce any access control or permission checks before routing to security-sensitive subcommands like Genesis, Governance, or Stake, or can any user execute validator operations through the CLI? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Enum: Tool] [Command Injection] Can an attacker craft malicious command-line arguments that exploit the clap parser configuration to inject arbitrary commands or bypass intended command routing logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Async Race Condition] Does the async execute() method handle concurrent execution properly, or can race conditions occur when multiple Tool variants are executed simultaneously, leading to state corruption or inconsistent results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Handling] Are errors from subcommand execution (lines 63-76) properly sanitized before propagation, or can sensitive information like private keys, validator secrets, or internal state leak through error messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker trigger resource exhaustion by repeatedly invoking expensive subcommands through the CLI, potentially causing denial of service to the node or validator? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Account] [Account Manipulation] Can malicious CLI inputs to the Account tool bypass account creation limits or validation, allowing creation of system accounts or accounts with invalid addresses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Genesis] [Genesis State Attack] Can an attacker use the Genesis tool to create malformed genesis configurations that bypass validator set requirements, enabling network takeover or consensus manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Governance] [Governance Bypass] Does the Governance tool routing properly authenticate proposal creators, or can unauthorized users submit governance proposals that could modify protocol parameters or drain the treasury? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Stake] [Staking Manipulation] Can the Stake tool be exploited to bypass minimum stake requirements, manipulate validator set membership, or claim rewards without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Key] [Key Material Exposure] Does the Key tool properly protect cryptographic key material during generation or display, or can keys be leaked through insecure storage, logging, or error messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Move] [Move Bytecode Attack] Can the Move tool be used to compile and deploy malicious Move modules that bypass safety checks, exploit VM vulnerabilities, or execute unauthorized operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Multisig] [Multisig Threshold Bypass] Can the Multisig tool routing be exploited to bypass signature threshold requirements, allowing unauthorized transaction execution with insufficient signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Node] [Node Configuration Attack] Can malicious inputs to the Node tool corrupt validator configuration files, modify consensus parameters, or introduce backdoors into node operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Config] [Configuration Injection] Does the Config tool validate configuration values, or can attackers inject malicious settings that compromise node security, such as disabling signature verification or opening debug ports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Update] [Supply Chain Attack] Can the Update tool be exploited to download and execute malicious binary updates, bypassing signature verification or checksum validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Workspace] [Workspace Isolation] Does the hidden Workspace command properly isolate operations, or can it be exploited to access files outside intended directories, leading to unauthorized file access or code execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Variant: Tool::Info] [Information Disclosure] Does the Info tool expose sensitive build information, internal paths, or version details that could aid attackers in identifying vulnerabilities or attack surfaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: InfoTool::execute()] [Build Information Leak] Can the cli_build_information() function return sensitive compilation flags, internal repository paths, or debug symbols that reveal security mechanisms or facilitate exploit development? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 4: unsafe_code deny] [Unsafe Code Bypass] Does the #![deny(unsafe_code)] directive effectively prevent unsafe code in all submodules, or can unsafe operations be introduced through dependencies or feature flags? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Lines 15-16: Test Feature] [Test Code in Production] Can the test/fuzzing feature flag be accidentally enabled in production builds, exposing test-only functions that bypass security checks or allow unauthorized operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic Handling] Are panics in subcommand execution properly caught and handled, or can they crash the CLI process and potentially corrupt local state or leave partial transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Parser: clap] [Parser Vulnerabilities] Does the clap parser configuration properly validate all input arguments, or can buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other parser vulnerabilities be triggered through crafted CLI arguments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Line 31: propagate_version] [Version Confusion] Can the propagate_version setting be exploited to cause version mismatches between CLI and node components, leading to incompatible operations or protocol violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/lib.rs] [Function: execute()] [Serialization Issues] Do the execute_serialized() and execute_serialized_success() calls properly handle serialization errors, or can malformed output cause downstream parsing failures or security issues? (Medium)",
