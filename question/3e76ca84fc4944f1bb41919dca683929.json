  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Channel size saturation] If channel_size (line 33) is set to 1, does this create a channel so small that even normal operation causes blocking, potentially allowing a single slow request sender to DoS the entire connectivity management system? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Seed peer explosion] Can the seeds PeerSet (line 29) contain an unbounded number of peers that, when processed during initialization, cause memory exhaustion or excessive dial queue size, leading to validator startup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Panic on None] The .expect() call on line 72-73 with message 'Service Must be present' will panic if connectivity_manager is None, but is there any guarantee this panic won't crash critical validator components, causing immediate loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Unwrap hidden in new()] If ConnectivityManager::new() (line 47-61) contains unwrap() or expect() calls that can panic on invalid parameters, will these panics during builder construction crash the validator during startup without proper error reporting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [TimeService panic] Can a malicious or faulty TimeService implementation cause panics when interval() is called with the connectivity_check_interval Duration, potentially crashing the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [PeerManager channel mismatch] If connection_reqs_tx and connection_notifs_rx (lines 34-35) are from different PeerManager instances or mismatched network contexts, can this cause connection requests to be routed incorrectly, leading to cross-network connection pollution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Discovery vs seeds conflict] When both seeds (line 29) and later OnChainValidatorSet updates provide addresses for the same PeerId, can conflicting information cause the ConnectivityManager to oscillate between addresses or connect to both, wasting resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: conn_mgr_reqs_tx()] [Sender leak] If conn_mgr_reqs_tx() is called and the returned sender is never dropped, can this prevent the channel from being closed properly when the ConnectivityManager should shutdown, causing resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Empty seeds handling] If the seeds PeerSet (line 29) is empty, does this cause the validator to have no initial peers to connect to, and can this lead to network isolation where the validator never discovers other peers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Duration edge cases] When creating Duration::from_millis() for connectivity_check_interval_ms (line 55) and max_connection_delay_ms (line 57), are there checks for overflow or extremely large values that could cause timing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Backoff base minimum] If backoff_base (line 31) is 0, does ExponentialBackoff::from_millis(0) create a backoff strategy that never delays, causing immediate dial retry loops that could create connection storms? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Executor panic] If the executor Handle (line 69) panics or is in an invalid state when spawn() is called, does this panic propagate to the caller or get caught, and could this cause validator initialization to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: create()] [Arc reference cycle] Since peers_and_metadata is Arc<PeersAndMetadata> (line 28) and is cloned into ConnectivityManager, can circular references form if PeersAndMetadata also holds references to ConnectivityManager, causing memory leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Task handle leak] Does executor.spawn() return a JoinHandle that should be stored to ensure the task completes or is cancelled properly, or can orphaned tasks continue running after validator shutdown causing resource leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/connectivity_manager/builder.rs] [Function: conn_mgr_reqs_tx()] [Channel leak] Each call to conn_mgr_reqs_tx() clones the sender (line 66), but if these clones accumulate without being dropped, can this prevent the channel from being properly closed and cleaned up? (Low)"
