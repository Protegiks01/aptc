  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Struct: CommitmentKey] [Domain size overflow] The m_inv field stores the inverse of domain size, but what happens if m exceeds field prime size? Could m_inv become incorrect due to modular reduction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Struct: CommitmentKey] [Roots of unity ordering] The roots_of_unity_in_eval_dom vector stores precomputed roots - if the ordering is corrupted or doesn't match eval_dom.elements(), will commitments and openings fail or produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Struct: CommitmentKey] [tau_1 and xi_1 collision] If setup somehow produces tau_1 == xi_1 (same point), would the commitment scheme collapse to a trivial binding scheme without hiding? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Struct: Witness] [Randomness disclosure] The Witness struct contains hiding_randomness as a public field - can this randomness be extracted through reflection, serialization, or debug output, breaking the hiding property? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Struct: Witness] [Values vector cloning] The values field is Vec<Scalar<E>> which may be cloned multiple times - do clones leave traces of committed values in memory that can be recovered? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Trait: homomorphism::Trait] [Apply function determinism] The apply() function at line 287 calls msm_terms() then apply_msm() - is this guaranteed deterministic across different Rust compiler versions and CPU architectures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Trait: homomorphism::Trait] [Codomain type safety] The Codomain is TrivialShape<E::G1> - does this wrapper provide actual type safety, or can it be unwrapped to manipulate raw G1 points without homomorphism invariants? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Trait: sigma_protocol::Trait] [DST uniqueness] The domain separation tag 'APTOS_HIDING_KZG_SIGMA_PROTOCOL_DST' at line 328 is hardcoded - can this tag collide with other protocols in Aptos, enabling cross-protocol attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Trait: sigma_protocol::Trait] [DST insufficient length] The DST is only 37 bytes - is this sufficient for collision resistance, or should it include versioning, parameter binding, or cryptographic commitments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Type: Commitment] [Wrapper bypass] Commitment<E> is a type alias for CodomainShape<G1> - can type casting bypass commitment integrity checks by directly manipulating the underlying G1 point? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Type: CommitmentRandomness] [Randomness type confusion] CommitmentRandomness<E> is just Scalar<E> - can this be confused with polynomial evaluation scalars, leading to randomness reuse as polynomial coefficients? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Function: setup()] [Field element inverse] At line 133, m_inv uses .unwrap() on inverse calculation - if m equals the field characteristic or certain special values, can inverse() return None causing panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Function: CommitmentHomomorphism::open()] [Scalar arithmetic overflow] The computation (ck.tau_1 - ck.one_1 * x) at line 189 involves point subtraction and scalar multiplication - can overflow occur if x is near field modulus? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pcs/univariate_hiding_kzg.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [FFT buffer overflow] The eval_dom.ifft() operation at line 97 operates on powers_of_tau - if the FFT implementation has buffer overflow bugs, can malicious tau values trigger memory corruption?
