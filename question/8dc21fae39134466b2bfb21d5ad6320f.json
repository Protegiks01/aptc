  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker craft malicious BCS-encoded bytes that cause integer overflow when deserializing the u64 amount field, potentially wrapping to zero and bypassing token balance checks leading to unauthorized token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely large BCS-encoded byte arrays with unbounded String fields (collection, name) that consume excessive memory during deserialization, causing validator node crashes and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type Confusion] Does the BCS deserialization properly validate type tags to prevent deserialization of incorrect types into TokenDeposit, which could bypass Move type safety and allow arbitrary data to be interpreted as token deposit events? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Panic Handling] Can malformed or truncated BCS bytes trigger panics during deserialization that are not properly caught, allowing attackers to crash validator nodes by emitting invalid TokenDeposit events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes with deeply nested structures or recursive references that cause stack overflow during deserialization, crashing validators and preventing event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] Does the new() constructor validate that the amount parameter is non-zero, or can attackers create zero-amount deposit events that could be used to spam the event system or manipulate token ownership records? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: new()] [Account Validation] Does new() verify that the account parameter is not a system reserved address (0x0, 0x1, etc.), allowing attackers to emit deposit events to privileged addresses and potentially bypass access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: new()] [Amount Overflow] When creating a TokenDeposit with the maximum u64 value for amount, can subsequent addition operations on this amount cause overflow in downstream processing, leading to token balance corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: new()] [TokenId Validation] Does new() validate the TokenId parameter to ensure the property_version is not u64::MAX, which could cause overflow when incrementing versions in token transfer operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: amount()] [Integer Overflow] When the returned amount is used in arithmetic operations (e.g., adding to existing balances), can integer overflow occur if the total exceeds u64::MAX, silently wrapping to a small value and allowing unlimited token minting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: amount()] [Zero Amount] Can amount() return 0 for valid deposit events, and if so, can this be exploited to create deposit records without actually transferring tokens, breaking accounting invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: amount()] [Precision Loss] When amount is used in calculations involving decimal conversions or gas computations, can precision loss lead to discrepancies between recorded and actual token amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: account()] [Address Spoofing] Can the returned AccountAddress be a maliciously crafted address that matches a system account through hash collision, allowing unauthorized deposits to privileged accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: account()] [Null Address] Does account() properly handle the zero address (0x0), or can deposits to the null address cause token burns that break conservation of token supply? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: account()] [Reference Lifetime] Can the returned reference to AccountAddress outlive the TokenDeposit struct in unsafe contexts, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities in event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: id()] [TokenId Collision] Can two different tokens share the same TokenId (same token_data_id and property_version), causing deposit events to be conflated and tokens to be credited to wrong recipients? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: id()] [Reference Safety] Does the returned reference to TokenId allow mutation in unsafe code blocks, potentially enabling attackers to modify token IDs after event emission and redirect deposits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Function: id()] [Clone Semantics] When TokenId is cloned from the returned reference, can the clone diverge from the original due to interior mutability patterns, causing inconsistent event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenId] [Property Version Overflow] Can the property_version field overflow to 0 after reaching u64::MAX, allowing attackers to create version collisions with existing tokens and potentially steal or duplicate tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenId] [Clone Safety] Does the Clone implementation for TokenId perform deep cloning of the nested token_data_id, or can shallow cloning lead to shared mutable state and race conditions in concurrent event processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenId] [Serialization Consistency] When TokenId is serialized and deserialized multiple times, can floating-point or precision errors in property_version cause the deserialized value to differ from the original? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [String Injection] Can the collection or name String fields contain malicious characters (null bytes, control characters, Unicode exploits) that cause parsing errors or injection attacks in downstream indexers or APIs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [Unbounded Strings] Are the collection and name String fields bounded in length, or can attackers create token IDs with multi-megabyte strings that exhaust storage and memory when processing deposit events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [Unicode Normalization] Can different Unicode normalizations of the same collection/name strings (NFC vs NFD) result in distinct TokenDataIds, allowing attackers to create collision attacks with visually identical token names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/token_deposit.rs] [Struct: TokenDataId] [Empty Strings] Can collection or name be empty strings, and if so, can this be exploited to create ambiguous token identifiers that conflict with system tokens or bypass validation checks? (Medium)"
