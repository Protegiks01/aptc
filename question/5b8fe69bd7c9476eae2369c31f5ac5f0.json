  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [All charge_* functions] [Ordering Dependencies] Do charge functions depend on being called in a specific order, and can out-of-order calls cause incorrect gas calculations or allow bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [All *_gas_used functions] [Summation Invariant] Is there proper validation that execution_gas_used + io_gas_used + storage_fee_used_in_gas_units equals total gas consumed from balance? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [VMResult return type] [Error Propagation] Do VMResult errors properly propagate to transaction rejection, or can error handling bugs allow transactions with gas errors to be committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Location::Undefined usage] [Error Attribution] Does using Location::Undefined in error handling (lines 185, 205, 270) make it impossible to diagnose gas metering bugs by hiding error sources? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Trait bounds] [Unsafe Implementations] Are trait bounds sufficient to prevent unsafe implementations that violate gas metering assumptions, or can attackers implement custom types that bypass safety? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [FeePerGasUnit] [Price Manipulation] Can FeePerGasUnit be set to extreme values (near zero or maximum) to break gas-to-fee conversions through overflow or division errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [InternalGas vs Gas] [Unit Confusion] Can confusion between InternalGas and external Gas units allow attackers to pay in wrong denominations, drastically under-paying for operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Fee vs Gas] [Currency Confusion] Can mixing Fee (Octa-denominated) and Gas (gas-unit-denominated) values cause accounting errors where fees are charged as gas or vice versa? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Trait default implementations] [Override Safety] Can trait implementers override default implementations (like process_storage_fee_for_all) in ways that break gas safety invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [charge_refund_write_op] [Refund > Charge] Can the ChargeAndRefund struct ever have refund > charge, and if so, does this create economic exploits where users profit from write operations? (Critical)",
