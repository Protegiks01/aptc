  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Configuration] [None limits] When limits are set to None in VerifierConfig, does this completely disable checks or use safe defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Feature flags] [Feature bypass] Are feature flags (enable_enum_types, enable_resource_access_control, enable_function_values) properly checked across all verification modules, or can features be used when disabled? (High)",

  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod regression_tests] [Test bypass] Are the regression_tests module's checks run during production verification, or are known vulnerabilities only caught in testing? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Module: mod regression_tests] [Test coverage gaps] Does the private regression_tests module cover all historical vulnerabilities, or are there known exploits that aren't tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/src/lib.rs] [Bounds checking] [Index validation] Do all public modules that access indexed structures (function tables, struct tables) properly validate indices, or can out-of-bounds access occur? (Critical)",
