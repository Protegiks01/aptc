(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Configuration override] Can an attacker use specially crafted arguments passed through lines 20, 22 to override security-critical configuration options in the benchmark or plot modules, such as disabling signature verification or changing trust anchors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment pollution] Does the tool at line 11 properly sanitize environment variables that might affect argument parsing or program behavior, or can an attacker manipulate environment variables to inject malicious arguments or change program flow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Working directory attacks] Can an attacker exploit the working directory context when this tool is invoked, causing it to read or write files in unintended locations when relative paths are used in arguments passed at lines 20, 22? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Umask bypass] If benchmark::benchmark() or plot::plot_svg() create files, do they respect the system umask, or could attacker-controlled arguments at lines 20, 22 cause files to be created with overly permissive permissions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Concurrent execution] If multiple instances of this tool are run simultaneously with the same arguments, can race conditions occur in benchmark::benchmark() or plot::plot_svg() that lead to corrupted output files, data loss, or security vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File locking] When benchmark writes results to files or plot reads/writes SVG files, are proper file locks used to prevent race conditions where concurrent executions could corrupt data or cause security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Null byte injection] Can an attacker inject null bytes in command-line arguments that cause the string comparison at lines 19-26 to match incorrectly or cause the called functions to misinterpret file paths and other parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-prover/lab/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Integer overflow in args] If an attacker provides an extremely large number of arguments (billions), could this cause integer overflow when calculating `args.len()` at line 12 or when creating slices at lines 20, 22, leading to memory corruption?
