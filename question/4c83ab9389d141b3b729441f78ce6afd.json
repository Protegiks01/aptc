  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/helpers.rs] [Function: make_module_natives()] [Error propagation] If Into<String> conversion fails (unlikely but possible with custom types), how is the error propagated through the iterator chain and does it leave the native table in a safe state? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/helpers.rs] [Function: make_module_natives()] [Concurrent registration] In a multi-threaded VM initialization scenario, can concurrent calls to make_module_natives() for different modules cause data races in the underlying HashMap when all iterators are eventually consumed? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/helpers.rs] [Function: make_module_natives()] [Move VM version skew] Can version mismatches between the Move stdlib and Move VM runtime cause the (String, NativeFunction) tuple format to be interpreted incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/helpers.rs] [Function: make_module_natives()] [Malicious native implementation] Can an attacker exploit the generic NativeFunction type to register functions that appear valid but execute malicious code when called by Move contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/natives/helpers.rs] [Function: make_module_natives()] [Resource exhaustion in caller] Since the function is called by all native module registration functions (make_all), can an attacker cause resource exhaustion by triggering excessive calls during VM initialization?
