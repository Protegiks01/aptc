  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_outputs()] [Status Clone] Line 410 clones the transaction status - can modifications to the original status after cloning create inconsistencies in the returned data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_persisted_auxiliary_info_iterator()] [Iterator Bounds] Does the iterator properly enforce num_persisted_auxiliary_info as a hard limit, or can it return more items if the database contains them? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_persisted_auxiliary_info_iterator()] [No Pruning Check] Unlike other functions, this doesn't call error_if_ledger_pruned before creating the iterator - can this return pruned data or fail unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_persisted_auxiliary_info_iterator()] [Unchecked Start Version] Is start_version validated to be within reasonable bounds before creating the iterator, or can u64::MAX cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Direct Delegation] This function simply delegates to get_events_by_event_key - does this add any value or is it a potential bypass point for access controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_events()] [Deprecation Risk] The TODO comment indicates this will be deprecated - can the deprecation process introduce security gaps where old and new APIs behave differently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iterator()] [Iterator Lifetime] The returned iterator has lifetime '_ tied to self - can this create use-after-free scenarios if the AptosDB is dropped while iterators are still in use? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iterator()] [Limit Enforcement] Does the iterator respect the limit parameter strictly, or can concurrent writes cause it to return more transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_iterator()] [Pruning During Iteration] If pruning occurs while the iterator is active, can this cause the iterator to skip transactions or panic? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_transaction_info_iterator()] [Cast to usize] Line 506 casts limit from u64 to usize - can this truncate on 32-bit systems, returning fewer items than requested? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_iterator()] [Events Per Version] This returns Vec<ContractEvent> per version - can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by creating transactions with thousands of events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_events_iterator()] [Empty Event Lists] Does the iterator return empty vectors for versions with no events, or skip those versions - can this cause iteration count mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db/aptosdb_reader.rs] [Function: get_write_set_iterator()] [Write Set Size] Can an attacker cause DoS by requesting iterators over versions with extremely large write sets (e.g., genesis or major state changes)? (High)",
