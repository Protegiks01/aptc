  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: update_new_synced_metrics()] [Zero Transactions] If num_synced_transactions is 0, are metrics still updated correctly, or can repeated zero-transaction updates cause metric inaccuracies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: initialize_sync_gauges()] [Metrics Reset Attack] Can an attacker trigger initialize_sync_gauges() repeatedly to reset metrics, hiding actual sync progress and making DoS attacks harder to detect? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [All metric update functions] [Metric Overflow] Do metric counters use unbounded integer types that can overflow, or are they properly wrapped to prevent overflow attacks that could cause monitoring to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [All metric update functions] [Metric Injection] Can an attacker control any parameters that get directly logged or added to metrics, potentially injecting malicious values that exploit log parsing or metric aggregation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: get_data_notification()] [Stream Listener State] Does DataStreamListener maintain internal state that could be corrupted by malicious notifications, causing subsequent legitimate notifications to be mishandled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: terminate_stream_with_feedback()] [Feedback Flooding] Can an attacker provide extremely large NotificationAndFeedback objects that consume excessive memory or bandwidth when terminating streams? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/state-sync-driver/src/utils.rs] [Function: get_data_notification()] [Creation Time Manipulation] If data_notification.creation_time is far in the past, can the observed duration calculation overflow or produce invalid metrics that hide actual latency issues? (Low)"
