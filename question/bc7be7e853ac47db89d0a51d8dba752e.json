  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Overall] [Memory leak] If ApiIndexProvider instances are created but never dropped, can this leak memory through unclosed HTTP connections, cached data, or Arc reference cycles? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Field: output_cache] [Cache unbounded growth] Does OutputCache implement any limits on cached data size, or can a single large IndexResponse consume unbounded memory until TTL expires? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Overall] [Drop implementation] Is there a custom Drop implementation for ApiIndexProvider to cleanly release resources, or can abrupt process termination leave hanging connections or corrupted cache state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Struct: ApiIndexProviderConfig] [Configuration tampering] If configuration is loaded from untrusted sources (files, environment variables, network), can an attacker inject malicious cache_ttl_ms values to manipulate caching behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Struct: ApiIndexProviderConfig] [Default override] Can an attacker exploit Default trait implementation to reset cache_ttl_ms to default values at runtime, bypassing operator-configured security settings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Struct: ApiIndexProviderConfig] [Serialization inconsistency] Can round-trip serialization/deserialization of ApiIndexProviderConfig alter values due to serde settings, causing cached configurations to differ from runtime values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Struct: ApiIndexProviderConfig] [CommonProviderConfig inheritance] Does flattening CommonProviderConfig properly merge all fields, or can field name collisions cause security settings to be silently ignored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Struct: ApiIndexProviderConfig] [Validation missing] Is there any validation that cache_ttl_ms is within reasonable bounds (e.g., 100ms to 1 hour), or can operators accidentally configure dangerously long TTLs that serve stale data for extended periods? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Function: provide()] [Endpoint validation] Does provider verify that client.get_index() connects to the expected node API endpoint, or can DNS poisoning redirect requests to malicious servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Function: provide()] [Response authenticity] Does IndexResponse include cryptographic signatures or attestations to prove it came from a legitimate Aptos node, or can any HTTP server return valid-looking but fraudulent index data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Function: provide()] [HTTP downgrade attack] Does Client enforce HTTPS and prevent protocol downgrade attacks, or can an attacker force plaintext HTTP communication to intercept and modify IndexResponse data? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Function: provide()] [Response injection] Can an attacker performing MITM inject additional fields or modify existing fields in IndexResponse JSON, causing node-checker to make incorrect decisions based on tampered data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Overall] [Checker dependency] If downstream checkers blindly trust cached IndexResponse data without additional validation, can stale or poisoned cache entries cause incorrect health check results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Field: output_cache] [Cache awareness] The comment on line 34 warns checkers about cache behavior - if checkers are unaware of caching, can they make time-sensitive decisions based on outdated IndexResponse data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Function: provide()] [Checker coordination] If multiple checkers call provide() simultaneously, can race conditions in cache updates cause checkers to receive inconsistent IndexResponse snapshots during node state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Overall] [Error handling assumption] Do checkers properly handle ProviderError::RetryableEndpointError, or can they misinterpret transient failures as permanent node issues leading to false alarms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/api_index.rs] [Overall] [Cache invalidation coordination] Is there a mechanism for checkers to force cache refresh when they detect inconsistencies, or are they forced to wait for TTL expiration even when they know data is stale? (Medium)",
