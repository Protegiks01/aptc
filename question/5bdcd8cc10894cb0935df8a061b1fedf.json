  "[File: types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Memory] Can memory allocation failures during deserialize() leave the system in an inconsistent state where partial data is committed to consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Edge Case] Can serialize() handle Vec<Vec<u8>> where the total size exceeds usize::MAX (on 32-bit systems), or does this cause wraparound leading to truncated output? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/serde_helper/vec_bytes.rs] [Edge Case] If data contains only empty vectors (Vec<Vec<u8>> with all inner vecs empty), can this cause edge cases in sequence length encoding that break deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/serde_helper/bcs_utils.rs] [Edge Case] Can size_u32_as_uleb128() be called in a loop with incrementing values, and do transitions between size classes (1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→5 bytes) always happen at the correct boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/serde_helper/bcs_utils.rs] [Edge Case] At exactly u32::MAX, does the ULEB128 encoding require 5 bytes as specified, or can implementation details cause it to use 6 bytes, breaking protocol compatibility? (High)"
