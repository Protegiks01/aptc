(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/bls12381/bls12381_sigs.rs] [Function: aggregate()] [Missing subgroup check] Does aggregate() skip subgroup checking of input signatures (line 71 passes false to aggregate), allowing adversarial signature shares from Byzantine validators to poison the aggregate and cause verification failures, potentially halting consensus? (Critical)",
