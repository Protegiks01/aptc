  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [State synchronization] If the peers_and_metadata is updated by other network components during health checker initialization, can this cause race conditions where health check data is initialized for non-existent or already-disconnected peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Service lifecycle] If the health checker service is started before the network sender is fully initialized, can early health check attempts fail and incorrectly mark newly connected peers as unhealthy? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Protocol version mismatch] Can the HealthCheckerRpc protocol at line 41 be a different version than what the network_sender supports, causing health check messages to fail deserialization and be silently dropped? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Backward compatibility] If connecting to peers running older Aptos versions with different health check protocols, can protocol mismatch cause false positive health failures and unnecessary disconnections? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Task explosion] If start() is called in a loop without proper cleanup, can this spawn unbounded health checker tasks that exhaust executor thread pool resources? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Data race] Can the mutable reference &mut self in start() create data races if HealthCheckerBuilder is wrapped in Arc<Mutex> and accessed by multiple threads simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Shared state] Does the NetworkClient constructed at lines 39-44 properly handle concurrent access to network_senders hashmap, or can concurrent sends cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Monitoring blind spot] After start() takes the service, is there any way to query the health checker's status or retrieve metrics, or is it completely opaque leading to debugging difficulties? (Low)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Metadata injection] Can the peers_and_metadata Arc be pre-populated with malicious peer entries before the health checker starts, causing the health checker to waste resources pinging non-existent or malicious peers? (Medium)",

  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero-peer scenario] If peers_and_metadata starts empty, does the health checker handle the zero-peer case gracefully, or can it cause division by zero or other edge case errors? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Single-peer network] In a test network with only 2 validators, can overly aggressive health checking cause both validators to disconnect from each other, causing total network failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Maximum peers] Can the health checker scale to handle the maximum expected validator set size (e.g., 1000+ validators), or will it degrade/fail with large peer counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Type confusion] Can the NetworkSender<HealthCheckerMsg> be incorrectly constructed with a sender for a different message type, causing runtime type errors when health checks are sent? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [API contract violation] If the caller provides a network_rx that expects a different protocol than HealthCheckerRpc, can this cause message handling errors and health checker crashes? (Medium)",
