  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/counters.rs] [Static metrics] [Metric type] Can the use of IntGaugeVec for LATEST_PROCESSED_VERSION (line 150) cause issues if version numbers need to decrease during chain reorganizations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/counters.rs] [Static metrics] [Counter semantics] Is IntCounterVec appropriate for TOTAL_SIZE_IN_BYTES and NUM_TRANSACTIONS_COUNT (lines 160, 170) given that counters only increase and never reset - could this cause issues during indexer restarts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/counters.rs] [Static metrics] [Gauge updates] When using GaugeVec.set() for DURATION_IN_SECS at line 236, can rapid updates from concurrent requests cause the gauge to reflect an unrepresentative sample? (Low)",
