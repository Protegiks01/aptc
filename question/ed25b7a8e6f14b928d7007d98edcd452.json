  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdinAsDataSink::poll_write()] [Wake Handling] Can lost wake notifications cause the async writer to hang indefinitely waiting for write readiness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdoutAsDataSource::poll_read()] [Data Truncation] If the child process is killed mid-output, can partial data be committed to backup causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdinAsDataSink::poll_write()] [Write Atomicity] Are writes to stdin atomic, or can they be interleaved with signal handlers or system calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdoutAsDataSource::poll_read()] [Buffer Size] Can extremely large reads cause buffer allocation failures or integer overflows in ReadBuf? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdinAsDataSink::poll_write()] [Partial Writes] If poll_write returns Ok(n) where n < buf.len(), how is the partial write handled by callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdoutAsDataSource::poll_read()] [Encoding Issues] If the child outputs non-UTF8 data, can it cause decoding errors or be interpreted as control characters? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: SpawnedCommand::join()] [Error Recovery] If join() fails, is there retry logic or are backups permanently failed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdoutAsDataSource::poll_read()] [Error Recovery] When join_fut returns an error, is the error properly propagated or can it be silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: ChildStdinAsDataSink::poll_shutdown()] [Error Recovery] If shutdown fails halfway, can the backup be in an inconsistent state requiring manual cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/storage/command_adapter/command.rs] [Function: SpawnedCommand::spawn()] [Error Context] Does .err_notes() provide sufficient context for debugging failures, or can errors be opaque? (Low)"
