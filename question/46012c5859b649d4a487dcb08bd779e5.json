  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: StateMerkleCommitProgress] [Merkle tree synchronization] Can StateMerkleCommitProgress updates lag behind actual Merkle tree updates, causing state root mismatches during consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Key: OverallCommitProgress] [Restore interaction] During state restoration using StateSnapshotKvRestoreProgress, can OverallCommitProgress be incorrectly updated, causing the restored database to appear more or less complete than it actually is? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Memory exhaustion] Can deserializing extremely large StateSnapshotProgress values cause out-of-memory conditions, enabling DoS attacks against validator nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Vector allocation] Does encode_key() properly handle allocation failures when creating the Vec<u8> for large keys, or can OOM cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Enum: DbMetadataKey] [Key proliferation] Can attackers create unbounded numbers of shard-specific keys (e.g., StateMerkleShardRestoreProgress(shard, version)) to exhaust database capacity? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [No integrity protection] Are metadata values authenticated or checksummed, or can silent corruption of metadata go undetected until causing critical failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [No encryption] Are sensitive metadata values (if any exist) encrypted at rest, or are all metadata values stored in plaintext? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/db_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: DbMetadataSchema] [Missing metrics] Are there metrics or logs tracking metadata updates, or can malicious or buggy metadata modifications occur silently without detection? (Medium)",
