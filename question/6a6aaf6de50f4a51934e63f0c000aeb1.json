  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Type safety] Can a malicious Move module implement MoveEventV2Type with conflicting or spoofed struct_tag() values that don't match the actual type, allowing event type confusion attacks that could bypass event filtering or indexing logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Trait bounds] Does the trait's requirement for both MoveStructType and Serialize provide sufficient guarantees, or can a malicious implementation satisfy these bounds while producing invalid or malformed event data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Type tag manipulation] Can an attacker craft a malicious MoveStructType implementation that returns a struct_tag() with manipulated address, module, or name fields to spoof system events like FeeStatement or NewEpochEvent? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Serialization bomb] Can a malicious type implementing MoveEventV2Type cause excessive memory consumption or computation during bcs::to_bytes() serialization, potentially causing validator nodes to crash or slow down? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [BCS encoding attack] Can a malicious Serialize implementation produce non-canonical BCS encoding that passes validation but causes deserialization inconsistencies across different nodes, leading to consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Boxing overhead] Does the Box::new() wrapper around Self::struct_tag() introduce unnecessary heap allocation that could be exploited for memory exhaustion attacks when creating large numbers of events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Error propagation] Does the anyhow::Result error handling properly sanitize error messages, or can error details from bcs::to_bytes() or ContractEvent::new_v2() leak sensitive information about internal state or type structures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Size validation bypass] Since create_event_v2() calls ContractEvent::new_v2() which validates event size, can an attacker craft a type whose BCS serialization appears small initially but expands significantly, bypassing size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Generic type parameters] If a type implements MoveEventV2Type with generic type parameters in its struct_tag(), can type parameter manipulation lead to event type collisions or allow unauthorized event emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Recursive types] Can a malicious implementation create recursive or deeply nested type structures that cause stack overflow during TypeTag::Struct() construction or BCS serialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Type tag validation] Does the TypeTag::Struct(Box::new(Self::struct_tag())) construction validate that the StructTag is well-formed, or can invalid module addresses, names, or type arguments cause runtime panics or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Trait implementation security] Can untrusted Move code deploy modules with types implementing MoveEventV2Type that emit events masquerading as system-critical events like governance proposals or validator set changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Serialization non-determinism] Can custom Serialize implementations introduce non-determinism (e.g., using random values, timestamps, or system state) that causes validators to produce different event_data bytes, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Error handling completeness] Does the error handling cover all failure modes from bcs::to_bytes()? Can serialization failures for certain edge case types (e.g., types with NaN floats, if supported) cause unhandled panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Module address spoofing] Can a malicious module implement MoveEventV2Type with a struct_tag() claiming to be from the core framework address (0x1) to bypass event filtering or gain unauthorized privileges?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Trait coherence] Does Rust's trait coherence prevent multiple conflicting implementations of MoveEventV2Type for the same type? Can orphan rule violations allow malicious crates to override event creation behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Memory safety] Does the combination of Box::new() and self reference in bcs::to_bytes(self) create any potential use-after-free or double-free scenarios in unsafe code paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Event size limits] Can the event size validation in ContractEvent::new_v2() be bypassed by types that serialize to just under the limit but contain pointers or references to large external data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Default implementation risk] Since create_event_v2() provides a default implementation, can types avoid implementing proper validation by relying solely on this default, potentially allowing invalid events? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV2Type] [Visibility and access control] Since the trait is public, can external crates implement it for system types, potentially allowing unauthorized event emission that bypasses framework access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/move_utils/move_event_v2.rs] [Function: create_event_v2()] [Panic safety] Can any code path in create_event_v2() cause panics (e.g., unwrap() calls in dependencies) that could be triggered by malicious inputs to crash validator nodes? (High)"
