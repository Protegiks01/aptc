  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration cloning] The config is cloned from args.ready_server_args - can this lead to stale configuration if args are updated after construction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: new()] [Result error handling] The function returns Result<Self> but what errors can actually occur during construction? Are they properly propagated or silently ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyServerArgs] [Default port security] The default port 8070 - is this documented and communicated to users, or can it conflict with other common services causing silent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Async handler blocking] If health_checker.check() performs blocking operations without spawn_blocking, can it starve the async runtime and prevent other requests from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Server run await] The server.run(app).await never returns unless error - can graceful shutdown signals be handled properly or will shutdown hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Timeout future leak] When timeout() wraps health_checker.check(), are resources properly cleaned up if the future is cancelled or does this leak connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Await ordering] Multiple awaits on health_checker.check() happen sequentially - can an attacker exploit this ordering to cause deterministic service degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyData] [Serialization complexity] If HealthChecker's Serialize implementation is computationally expensive, can an attacker exploit this to cause CPU exhaustion when serializing large ready/not_ready lists? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Json response size] With many health checkers, can the Json(ReadyData) response exceed HTTP size limits or cause parsing failures in clients? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyData] [Circular references] If HealthChecker contains self-referential data, can serialization enter infinite loops causing stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Content-type validation] Does the Json response properly set Content-Type headers, or can this cause XSS vulnerabilities if browsers misinterpret the response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [IPv4 only binding] The server only binds to Ipv4Addr - does this prevent IPv6 clients from accessing the ready server in IPv6-only networks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Socket reuse] Are SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT enabled? Can this lead to multiple servers binding to the same port causing split-brain scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [HTTP method validation] The route uses get(root) - but are other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, DELETE properly rejected or can they cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Keep-alive connections] Does the server properly handle HTTP keep-alive? Can attackers keep connections open indefinitely exhausting connection pool? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Status code semantics] SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503) vs OK (200) - can clients misinterpret 503 as temporary outage and keep retrying, causing thundering herd when services recover? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Retry-After header] The 503 response doesn't include Retry-After header - can this cause aggressive client retries amplifying load during partial outages? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Response consistency] If health status changes between check iterations, can the response contain inconsistent ready/not_ready lists confusing clients about actual state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Boolean logic error] The condition 'if not_ready.is_empty()' determines status - but what if ready is also empty? Does this correctly represent a system with no services? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Resource leak on exit] When the server exits with error on line 96, are all TCP connections, threads, and file descriptors properly cleaned up? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyServerManager] [Drop implementation] Is there a Drop impl to clean up resources? If not, can premature drops leak health checker connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Server shutdown] How is graceful shutdown handled? Can in-flight health checks be interrupted causing partial state or connection leaks? (Medium)",
