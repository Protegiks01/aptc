  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Trait: ConfigOptimizer] [Optimizer Conflicts] Can multiple ConfigOptimizers modify the same ExecutionConfig fields creating conflicts or overwriting security-critical settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Parameter: node_config] [Shared State Races] Since sanitize() and optimize() take &NodeConfig and &mut NodeConfig respectively, can concurrent access to NodeConfig from different threads cause race conditions in config validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Parameter: chain_id] [Optional ChainId] When chain_id is None in sanitize() or optimize(), are security checks properly skipped or do they fail open allowing unsafe configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Parameter: local_config_yaml] [YAML Injection] Can the local_config_yaml parameter in optimize() contain malicious YAML that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities when checking for null values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Testing Bypass] The comment mentions genesis is 'for testing purposes' - can this testing feature be accidentally or maliciously enabled in production validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: discard_failed_blocks] [Production Safety] Is discard_failed_blocks=false (default) the correct production setting, or should it be configurable per-network to handle different threat models? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: blockstm_v2_enabled] [Feature Flag Safety] Does blockstm_v2_enabled require coordinated network-wide activation, or can individual validators enabling it early cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Empty File Attack] Does BCS deserialization of an empty genesis.blob file return a meaningful error or does it deserialize to unexpected/invalid Transaction values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Large Transaction Attack] Can genesis transactions be arbitrarily large, and does BCS deserialization impose size limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error Message Exposure] Do ConfigSanitizerFailed errors expose internal configuration details that could aid attackers in understanding validator security posture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Genesis Version Assumption] Does the check for version != GENESIS_VERSION correctly handle all non-genesis waypoint versions, or can specific version values bypass the optimization logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_EXECUTION_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL] [Default Override] If validators override the default concurrency to very low values, can this be detected and flagged as potentially malicious behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [Multiple Load Calls] Can load_from_path() be called multiple times on the same ExecutionConfig, and does each call properly replace or append to self.genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Multiple Save Calls] If save_to_path() is called multiple times, does each call overwrite the previous genesis.blob atomically without corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Memory Lifecycle] Is the genesis Transaction properly freed from memory after chain initialization, or does it persist unnecessarily consuming validator memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Struct: ExecutionConfig] [Config Hot-Reload] If ExecutionConfig supports hot-reloading at runtime, are security-critical fields like paranoid_type_verification immutable after initialization to prevent bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis_waypoint] [Waypoint Verification] Does the system cryptographically verify that the loaded genesis transaction matches the genesis_waypoint hash, or is the waypoint only used for comparison? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Waypoint Parsing] Can Waypoint::from_str() be exploited with malformed waypoint strings containing null bytes or control characters to cause parsing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [Genesis Transaction Validation] Does the loaded genesis Transaction undergo signature verification and structural validation before being used for chain initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Field: genesis] [WriteSet Validation] If genesis is a GenesisTransaction with WriteSetPayload, are the WriteSet operations validated to ensure they don't violate Move resource safety or create invalid initial state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: load_from_path()] [I/O Blocking] Is load_from_path() blocking I/O, and can slow filesystem operations (network mounts) cause validator initialization delays or timeouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/execution_config.rs] [Function: save_to_path()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Does save_to_path() check available disk space before writing, or can writing large genesis transactions fill disk and cause validator failures? (Medium)"
