  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: hash_peer_id()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker generate multiple PeerNetworkIds that produce identical hash values using the RandomState hasher, allowing them to manipulate peer prioritization by causing hash collisions? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: hash_peer_id()] [Determinism Attack] Since RandomState is created with RandomState::new(), does the hash seed remain constant across restarts, allowing attackers to pre-compute peer IDs that will consistently receive higher priority? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_hash()] [Priority Manipulation] Can malicious peers predict or brute-force peer IDs that hash to maximum u64 values, ensuring they always get prioritized over legitimate peers in the comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: hash_peer_id()] [Overflow] Does the hasher.finish() operation properly handle edge cases where peer_id bytes could cause hash overflow or wraparound, potentially creating predictable hash patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_simple()] [Network Priority Bypass] Can an attacker spoof their NetworkId to appear as a Validator network peer, bypassing the network ordering priority and gaining unfair transaction forwarding advantages? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_intelligent()] [Health Check Bypass] If peer monitoring metadata is manipulated to show false health status, can malicious peers bypass health-based prioritization and maintain high priority despite being unhealthy? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_intelligent()] [Distance Manipulation] Can attackers falsify their distance_from_validators value in network_info_response to appear closer to validators, gaining unfair priority in transaction forwarding? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_intelligent()] [Latency Spoofing] Can malicious peers manipulate their average_ping_latency_secs to artificially low values, ensuring they receive higher priority than legitimately fast peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_ping_latency()] [NaN/Infinity Attack] Does the comparison properly handle special float values (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) in ping latency, or can attackers inject these values to cause undefined ordering behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_ping_latency()] [Float Precision] Can attackers exploit floating-point precision issues by providing ping latencies that differ by less than epsilon, causing non-deterministic ordering across different nodes? (Low)",

  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: check_peer_metadata_health()] [Integer Overflow] Does the calculation current_timestamp_usecs.saturating_sub(peer_ledger_timestamp_usecs) properly handle the case where peer_ledger_timestamp_usecs is greater than current time, potentially indicating a peer with a clock ahead? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: check_peer_metadata_health()] [Configuration Bypass] Can attackers exploit edge cases where max_sync_lag_before_unhealthy_secs is set to very large values (near u64::MAX), making the health check effectively meaningless? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: check_peer_metadata_health()] [Multiplication Overflow] In the calculation max_sync_lag_usecs = max_sync_lag_secs * MICROS_PER_SECOND, can an attacker set max_sync_lag_secs high enough to cause multiplication overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: get_timestamp_now_usecs()] [Cast Truncation] Does the cast as u64 from time_service.now_unix_time().as_micros() properly handle overflow when the microsecond value exceeds u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_peer_health()] [Denial of Service] If all peers are marked unhealthy simultaneously, does the prioritization logic still function correctly, or could this cause mempool to stop forwarding transactions? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_validator_distance()] [Distance Falsification] Can malicious VFN nodes claim distance_from_validators = 0 to appear as direct validator connections, gaining unfair priority in transaction routing? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: compare_validator_distance()] [Missing Metadata Exploit] Does the None case for validator distance allow peers without metadata to be deprioritized below legitimately far peers, potentially excluding valid new peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: get_distance_from_validators()] [Nested Option Attack] Can attackers exploit the nested Option handling where latest_network_info_response is wrapped in monitoring_metadata, potentially providing malformed data? (Low)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: update_sender_bucket_for_peers()] [Division by Zero] In the calculation average_mempool_traffic_observed = num_mempool_txns / max(1, secs_elapsed), can secs_elapsed == 0 cause issues if max(1, ...) is not applied correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: update_sender_bucket_for_peers()] [Traffic Manipulation] Can attackers artificially inflate num_mempool_txns_received_since_peers_updated to manipulate load balancing thresholds, forcing more peers to be selected for Primary priority? (High)",
  "[File: mempool/src/shared_mempool/priority.rs] [Function: update_sender_bucket_for_peers()] [Integer Overflow] Do the calculations for average_mempool_traffic_observed and average_committed_traffic_observed properly handle cases where transaction counts approach u64::MAX? (Medium)",
