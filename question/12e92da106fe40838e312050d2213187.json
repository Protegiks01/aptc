  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Test Coverage Gap] Does this test verify that the DuplicationChecker properly rejects ALL types of duplicate friend declarations, or could an attacker bypass detection by using different AddressIdentifierIndex values with the same underlying address? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Error Handling] Does the test verify that the error returned is specifically DUPLICATE_ELEMENT with IndexKind::ModuleHandle, or could incorrect error types be returned allowing attackers to probe for verification bypass vectors? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Edge Case] Does this test cover the case where more than 2 duplicate friend declarations exist (e.g., 3+ identical ModuleHandles), or could mass duplication bypass the checker and cause VM instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Clone Safety] The test uses handle.clone() to create duplicates - does this accurately reflect how malicious bytecode would encode duplicates, or could attackers use different serialization techniques to bypass hash-based duplicate detection? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Module State] Does the test verify that basic_test_module() starts with zero friend declarations, or could pre-existing friends in the module cause the test to pass incorrectly while missing actual duplication bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Determinism] Does the test verify that duplicate detection is deterministic across different validator nodes, or could non-deterministic HashSet iteration order cause consensus failures when different nodes process the same malicious module? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Index Bounds] Does the test verify that AddressIdentifierIndex(0) and IdentifierIndex(0) are within bounds of the basic_test_module's pools, or could out-of-bounds indices bypass duplication checking and cause crashes during verification? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Friend Semantics] Does this test verify that friend declarations cannot duplicate the self module (circular friendship), which could enable privilege escalation or access control bypass in the Move VM? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Attack Vector] Can an attacker craft a module with duplicate friend declarations pointing to critical system modules (like 0x1::coin or 0x1::aptos_account) to bypass friend visibility checks and access protected functions leading to fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Test Isolation] Does this test verify that the error is caught during DuplicationChecker::verify_module specifically, or could the error be caught by a different verifier stage, masking bugs in the duplication checker itself? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Memory Safety] Does the test verify that processing duplicate friend declarations doesn't cause memory corruption or use-after-free issues when the verifier accesses the friend_decls vector multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Function: duplicated_friend_decls()] [Position Sensitivity] Does the test verify that duplicates are detected regardless of their position in the friend_decls vector (e.g., indices 0 and 5, or 100 and 101), or only adjacent duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/duplication_tests.rs] [Missing Test] There is no test for duplicate identifiers in the identifiers pool - can an attacker craft a module with duplicate identifiers that bypasses verification, causing VM crashes when resolving function/struct names?
