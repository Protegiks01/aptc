  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Production Exposure] Can failpoints be accidentally left enabled in production builds if the conditional compilation macros are misconfigured, allowing attackers to trigger intentional API crashes and cause loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Configuration Bypass] Is there a risk that the failpoints_enabled config check can be bypassed through race conditions or TOCTOU issues when the configuration is dynamically reloaded, enabling unauthorized failpoint activation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Mainnet Protection] Does the config sanitizer's mainnet check properly prevent all scenarios where failpoints could be enabled on mainnet nodes, or are there edge cases during node initialization or configuration updates that could bypass this protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Feature Flag Security] Can the #[cfg(feature = \\",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Default Configuration] Is the default_disabled function for failpoints_enabled guaranteed to return false in all deployment scenarios, or could environment variables or config file parsing bugs result in failpoints being enabled by default? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Access Control] Does the /set_failpoint endpoint exposed in runtime.rs implement any authentication or authorization checks, or can any network attacker with API access trigger arbitrary failpoints to crash the node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Privilege Escalation] Can unprivileged API clients exploit the failpoint mechanism to escalate privileges by crashing specific API handlers that perform security checks, allowing subsequent requests to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Network Exposure] Is the /set_failpoint endpoint restricted to localhost or internal networks only, or is it exposed to public networks where external attackers could configure failpoints? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Rate Limiting] Are there rate limits on failpoint activation to prevent automated attacks that repeatedly trigger failpoints to sustain denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Format String Injection] The name parameter is formatted into a string with format!(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Path Traversal] Can the name parameter contain path traversal sequences (../, ./) that could target failpoints in unintended components outside the API layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [String Length] Is there a maximum length check on the name parameter to prevent memory exhaustion or buffer overflow when formatting the failpoint name string? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Special Characters] Can the name parameter contain special characters that break the fail crate's internal parsing, potentially causing undefined behavior or crashes in the failpoint infrastructure itself? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Unicode Handling] Does the failpoint naming support Unicode characters properly, or can Unicode normalization attacks or null byte injection be used to bypass failpoint name matching? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [API Availability] Can an attacker who gains access to failpoint configuration systematically crash all critical API endpoints (transactions, accounts, state) to completely disable the REST API and cause loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Validator Impact] If failpoints crash API handlers on validator nodes, can this prevent validators from participating in consensus by blocking transaction submission, account queries, or state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Cascade Failures] Can triggering failpoints in specific API handlers cause cascade failures in dependent components (mempool, storage, consensus messaging) leading to network-wide disruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can repeated failpoint activation consume system resources (memory, file descriptors, thread pool) without proper cleanup, eventually exhausting node resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Client Connection Storms] When failpoints crash API handlers, do client retry logic and connection storms amplify the impact, potentially overwhelming the node even after failpoints are disabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Error Message Leakage] The InternalError includes the failpoint name in the error message 'Failpoint unexpected internal error for {}' - does this leak sensitive information about internal API structure or debugging infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Stack Traces] When failpoints trigger errors, are detailed stack traces exposed to API clients that could reveal internal code paths, function names, or security-sensitive implementation details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Timing Attacks] Can attackers use failpoint activation timing to infer information about internal API handler execution paths, authentication checks, or resource availability? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Active Failpoint Enumeration] Is there an API endpoint to list currently active failpoints that could allow attackers to discover testing infrastructure and target specific vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Configuration Disclosure] Can attackers query whether failpoints are enabled through error message differences, API response variations, or timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/failpoint.rs] [Function: fail_point_poem()] [Transaction Interruption] If failpoints are triggered during transaction submission processing, can this leave transactions in inconsistent states in mempool or cause partial transaction data to be committed? (High)"
