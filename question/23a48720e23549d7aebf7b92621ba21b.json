  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/mod.rs] [Trait: FunderTrait::fund()] [Authorization bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the did_bypass_checkers boolean parameter to bypass maximum funding limits and drain faucet funds by repeatedly requesting the maximum_amount_with_bypass instead of the normal maximum_amount? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/mod.rs] [Trait: FunderTrait::get_amount()] [Integer overflow] If amount parameter is set to u64::MAX and maximum_amount is also u64::MAX, can this cause integer overflow when calculating minimum amounts or during subsequent arithmetic operations in funding logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/mod.rs] [Enum: FunderConfig::build()] [Configuration injection] Can an attacker provide a malicious FunderConfig via deserialization that exploits the async build process to create a compromised Funder instance with elevated privileges or bypassed safety checks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/mod.rs] [Enum: Funder] [Type confusion] Does the enum_dispatch mechanism properly validate type safety when dispatching to different Funder implementations, or can type confusion attacks allow calling wrong implementation methods? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/common.rs] [Function: update_sequence_numbers()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to update_sequence_numbers for the same asset create race conditions in the outstanding_requests HashMap, causing sequence number corruption and transaction failures or double-spending? (Critical)",
