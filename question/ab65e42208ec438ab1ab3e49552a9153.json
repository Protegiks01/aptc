  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [API compatibility] If REST API endpoints return addresses standardized differently than this indexer function, can clients receive inconsistent address representations for the same transaction, causing confusion and incorrect application logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [SDK compatibility] If official Aptos SDKs use different address standardization logic, can applications built with SDKs be unable to find their transactions in the indexer, effectively breaking transaction history queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Explorer compatibility] If blockchain explorers use this indexer but render addresses using different standardization, can users searching for their address in one format fail to find transactions, damaging user experience and trust? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Wallet compatibility] If wallet applications store addresses in short form but indexer uses long form, can transaction matching fail causing wallets to display incorrect balances or missing transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Smart contract addressing] If Move smart contracts reference addresses in specific formats, but the indexer standardizes them differently, can event logs and transaction traces have mismatched addresses preventing proper transaction attribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Database storage format] If the indexer stores both raw and standardized addresses, can discrepancies between them grow over time due to bugs, causing database corruption that requires full reindexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Historical data migration] If the standardization logic changes in an update, are historical addresses re-standardized? Can mismatches between old and new formats break historical transaction lookups or analytics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Backup and restore] If an indexer backup contains addresses standardized with old logic, and restore uses new logic, can address mismatches cause queries to fail or return incorrect results after restore? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Data validation] Does the indexer validate that all stored addresses match the expected standardized format? If not, can gradual corruption go undetected until it causes catastrophic query failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Audit trail] If address standardization changes silently (e.g., due to library updates), can this create an unauditable discrepancy where the same transaction is indexed under different addresses at different times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Missing test cases] The tests at lines 38-103 cover basic cases but don't test edge cases like empty strings, overly long strings, invalid UTF-8, non-hex characters, uppercase letters, or mixed case. Can untested edge cases cause production failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Fuzzing gaps] Has this function been fuzzed with random inputs including malformed UTF-8, control characters, extreme lengths, and special characters? Without fuzzing, can rare input combinations cause crashes in production indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Property-based testing] Are there property-based tests ensuring standardize_address() is idempotent (standardize(standardize(x)) == standardize(x))? Without this, can double-standardization cause address corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Boundary testing] Do tests verify exact boundary cases like 64-character addresses, 65-character addresses, and addresses at special/non-special boundary (0xf vs 0x10)? Can boundary bugs cause production failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Performance testing] Are there benchmarks for standardize_address() with various input sizes? Can performance regressions in string manipulation go unnoticed until they cause indexer slowdowns under load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Address format upgrade] If Aptos upgrades to 256-bit addresses, does this function need updates? Can outdated code continue running, producing incorrect 64-character addresses when 128 characters are needed, corrupting post-upgrade indexer data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Special address expansion] If governance expands special address range (e.g., 0x0-0xff instead of 0x0-0xf), will this code automatically adapt or does it need manual updates? Can mismatched special address logic cause indexer inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [AIP-40 revision] If AIP-40 gets revised with new standardization rules, how quickly can this code be updated? Can lag in updates cause newly minted addresses to be indexed incorrectly, breaking transaction lookups? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Backward compatibility] If standardization logic changes, does the indexer maintain backward compatibility with old address formats in queries? Can breaking changes render historical data inaccessible? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Feature flags] Is this standardization logic controlled by feature flags for gradual rollout?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Memory allocation DoS] Can an attacker trigger excessive memory allocation by providing addresses that cause repeated String reallocations during push_str operations, eventually causing OOM in the indexer process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [String comparison DoS] If standardized addresses are used in hash maps or sets, can attacker craft addresses that cause hash collisions, degrading lookup from O(1) to O(n) and slowing indexer queries?
