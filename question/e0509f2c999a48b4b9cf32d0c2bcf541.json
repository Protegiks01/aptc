  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [No authentication] The root endpoint at / has no authentication - can external attackers repeatedly query health status to perform reconnaissance or trigger expensive health checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [No rate limiting] Without rate limiting on the root handler, can an attacker send thousands of requests per second to exhaust health checking resources and cause validator slowdowns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [No TLS/encryption] The server binds to plain HTTP - can attackers intercept health check responses on the network to learn about service availability for timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [No access control] Any network client that can reach the port can query health status - can this be exploited in multi-tenant environments to leak information across isolation boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Server name exposure] The server is named 'ready-server' - does this expose implementation details that could help attackers fingerprint the Aptos version and find known vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [No request size limits] Are there any limits on HTTP request size? Can an attacker send massive requests to cause memory exhaustion in the poem web server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [No connection limits] Does TcpListener have a maximum connection limit? Can an attacker open thousands of connections to exhaust file descriptors and prevent legitimate health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [Tracing middleware vulnerability] The Tracing middleware is enabled - can verbose logging of health check requests be exploited to fill disk space or leak sensitive information in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyServerManager] [HashSet ordering] Since HashSet has no guaranteed iteration order, can this cause non-deterministic health check ordering leading to race conditions or flaky test results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Vector reallocation] The ready and not_ready vectors grow dynamically - can an attacker add thousands of health checkers to cause excessive memory allocations and trigger OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Clone overhead] Each HealthChecker is cloned when added to ready/not_ready vectors - if HealthChecker contains large data structures, can this cause significant memory overhead and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: HealthCheckers] [Reference counting] If HealthChecker uses Arc internally, can circular references cause memory leaks when health checkers reference each other? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Stale health status] Health checks are performed on every request - can this cause inconsistent results where a service appears ready in one request but not_ready in the next due to transient failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [No caching] Without result caching, can rapid successive requests to root() cause redundant health checks that overwhelm backend services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyServerManager] [Immutable health checkers] The health_checkers set is fixed at construction - can services that start later never be included in health checks, causing incomplete ready status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Partial success handling] If some health checks succeed and others fail, does the SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE status code adequately represent the partial availability state for load balancers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: get_name()] [Fixed name collision] The service name is hardcoded as 'Ready Server' - can multiple instances cause name collisions in service registries leading to routing errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: get_health_checkers()] [Empty health check set] This returns an empty HashSet intentionally - but does this break the health checking contract expected by other services, causing startup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: get_prerequisite_health_checkers()] [No prerequisites] By returning an empty set, can the ready server start before critical dependencies are available, exposing false ready status? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_service()] [Boxed self consumption] The function takes Box<ReadyServerManager> - can this cause use-after-free if the health_checkers are accessed after the box is moved? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [HealthChecker dependency] The root() handler calls health_checker.check() which may perform external HTTP/gRPC/database calls - can failures in these dependencies cascade to crash the ready server? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Poem framework vulnerability] The code depends on the poem web framework - are there known vulnerabilities in the poem version used that could allow remote code execution on the ready server? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: run_ready_server()] [TcpListener security] Does TcpListener properly handle TCP connection attacks like SYN floods, slowloris, or connection exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Function: root()] [Tokio runtime exhaustion] If health checks spawn many async tasks, can they exhaust the tokio runtime's thread pool causing all async operations in the localnet to stall? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/ready_server.rs] [Struct: ReadyServerArgs] [Port range validation] Does clap validate that ready_server_listen_port is in valid range (0-65535)? Can overflow cause the server to bind to unexpected ports? (Medium)"
