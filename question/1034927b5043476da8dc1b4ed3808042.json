  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/stored_package.rs] [Integration] [Bytecode-source sync] Is there a mechanism to ensure bytecode fetched via get_bytecode() matches the source saved via save_package_to_disk(), or can out-of-sync states occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/stored_package.rs] [Integration] [Gas implications] Does fetching large numbers of modules with bytecode cause excessive gas usage or rate limiting on the REST API? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/stored_package.rs] [Attack: Bytecode tampering] During the window between fetching PackageRegistry and fetching individual module bytecode in create(), can an attacker update on-chain modules to inject malicious bytecode? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/stored_package.rs] [Attack: Directory pollution] Can an attacker craft package metadata that causes save_package_to_disk() to pollute the filesystem with thousands of .move files in unexpected locations? (Medium)",
