  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: NativeEventContext] [State corruption] Can concurrent transactions modify the events vector simultaneously leading to race conditions where events are lost, duplicated, or reordered, causing state inconsistency across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: NativeEventContext] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker emit an unbounded number of events in a single transaction to exhaust validator memory before gas limits are enforced, potentially causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Struct: NativeEventContext] [Event ordering] Does the events vector maintain deterministic ordering across parallel execution, or can Block-STM cause non-deterministic event ordering leading to different state roots across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Field: events] [Storage leak] Can the Vec<(ContractEvent, Option<MoveTypeLayout>)> grow unbounded during a long-running transaction, and is there proper cleanup on transaction abort to prevent memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Trait: SessionListener] [Lifecycle violation] Are the start(), finish(), and abort() methods properly synchronized with transaction execution phases, or can timing issues cause events to persist after transaction abort? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Method: start()] [Session isolation] Does the start() method properly isolate events between nested sessions, or can events from inner sessions leak to outer sessions causing security violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Method: finish()] [Incomplete implementation] The finish() method contains TODO(sessions) - can this incomplete implementation cause events to be committed even when they should be rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Method: abort()] [Incomplete implementation] The abort() method contains TODO(sessions) - does this allow emitted events to persist after transaction failure, violating atomicity and potentially causing fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Method: legacy_into_events()] [Event exposure] Can calling legacy_into_events() multiple times cause event duplication or allow unauthorized access to events from other transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Method: events_iter()] [Iterator safety] Does the events_iter() iterator maintain thread-safety, or can concurrent modifications during iteration cause undefined behavior or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker provide mismatched type arguments where ty_args[0] differs from the actual message type, causing type confusion and potential memory corruption during serialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Assertion bypass] The debug_assert! checks for ty_args.len() and arguments.len() are only active in debug builds - can production builds be exploited with incorrect argument counts causing panics or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Integer overflow] Can the gas calculation EVENT_WRITE_TO_EVENT_STORE_BASE + EVENT_WRITE_TO_EVENT_STORE_PER_ABSTRACT_VALUE_UNIT * abs_val_size overflow, allowing attackers to emit large events with insufficient gas charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Gas bypass] Can abs_val_size() return incorrect sizes for complex nested structures, allowing attackers to emit expensive events while paying minimal gas, leading to validator DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Type tag manipulation] Can type_to_type_tag() be manipulated to produce incorrect type tags that bypass event validation or cause deserialization failures in indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Layout exploitation] Can type_to_type_layout_with_delayed_fields() be exploited to produce malicious layouts that cause serialization to fail silently or produce corrupted event data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Delayed fields attack] Can the contains_delayed_fields flag be manipulated to cause incorrect layout cloning or skip necessary layout validation, leading to event data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [Serialization failure] When serialize() returns None, an UNKNOWN_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_ERROR is raised - can this be triggered maliciously to abort transactions at a critical point causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [BCS deserialization] Can the bcs::from_bytes() call for guid parsing be exploited with malformed input to cause panics, infinite loops, or memory exhaustion in the BCS parser? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/event.rs] [Function: native_write_to_event_store()] [EventKey mismatch] When BCS deserialization fails, EVENT_KEY_MISMATCH is returned - can an attacker craft guid bytes that pass BCS parsing but create invalid EventKeys causing indexer corruption?
