  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Enum: CheckerConfig] [Build version bypass] The BuildVersionChecker validates node software versions - can an attacker remove or disable this checker from the configuration to allow outdated or vulnerable node versions to pass health checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: Multiple Checkers] [Checker interference] Can enabling certain checker combinations cause interference where one checker's operations affect another checker's results, allowing an attacker to mask failures by carefully choosing checker combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: Multiple Checkers] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] If checkers run sequentially, can node state change between checker executions allowing an attacker to pass early checks but fail later checks without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: Multiple Checkers] [Score aggregation] Given that CheckSummary aggregates scores from all checkers, can an attacker configure many benign checkers with perfect scores to dilute the impact of a single critical failing checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: Handshake + Identity] [Identity spoofing] Can the HandshakeChecker pass while NodeIdentityChecker fails (or vice versa) allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate node during health checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Integration: StateSyncVersion] [Version downgrade] Can an attacker manipulate StateSyncVersionChecker configuration to accept outdated state sync versions, potentially allowing state sync manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Return: Box<dyn Checker>] [Trait object safety] Are all Checker trait implementations truly object-safe, or can certain edge cases in checker implementations violate object safety causing vtable corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Return: Box<dyn Checker>] [Dynamic dispatch attack] Can an attacker exploit dynamic dispatch overhead by configuring thousands of checkers, causing severe performance degradation that constitutes a DoS attack on the node checker service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Return: Box<dyn Checker>] [Lifetime safety] When Box<dyn Checker> instances are stored and used across async boundaries, are there any scenarios where lifetime guarantees could be violated causing use-after-free vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Return: Box<dyn Checker>] [Vtable manipulation] In the trait object Box<dyn Checker>, could an attacker exploit vtable pointers through memory corruption to redirect checker method calls to arbitrary code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Imports: Lines 19-32] [Module confusion] The mod.rs imports 12 different checker modules - can module path confusion or naming collisions be exploited to load malicious checker implementations instead of legitimate ones? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Exports: Lines 34-35] [Trait visibility] The Checker and CheckerError traits are publicly exported - does this exposure allow external code to implement malicious Checker instances that bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [Exports: Lines 34-35] [Type visibility] CheckResult and CheckSummary are publicly exported - can external code craft malicious check results that bypass aggregation logic or manipulate summary scores? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::ConsensusProposals] [Consensus bypass] Can an attacker disable ConsensusProposalsChecker to hide that their node is not proposing blocks, allowing a non-participating validator to appear healthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::ConsensusRound] [Round manipulation] Can ConsensusRoundChecker be configured with permissive thresholds that allow a node stuck on old rounds to pass health checks, potentially masking consensus participation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::ConsensusTimeouts] [Timeout hiding] Can an attacker configure ConsensusTimeoutsChecker to ignore excessive timeouts, hiding that their validator is frequently timing out and degrading network performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::ConsensusProposals+Round+Timeouts] [Combined consensus attack] If all three consensus checkers are disabled or misconfigured, can a malicious validator participate in the network while being completely unhealthy, potentially causing consensus delays or liveness issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Tps] [TPS manipulation] The TpsChecker::new(config)? is the only constructor that can fail - can an attacker craft TPS configs that cause initialization to fail, preventing TPS validation entirely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::TransactionCorrectness] [Transaction bypass] Can TransactionCorrectnessChecker be disabled to allow nodes that produce incorrect transaction execution results to appear healthy, potentially causing state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Tps+TransactionCorrectness] [Execution validation gap] If both TPS and TransactionCorrectness checkers are misconfigured, can a node pass health checks while producing invalid transaction results at any throughput? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::MinimumPeers] [Network isolation] Can MinimumPeersChecker be configured with a threshold of 0 or 1, allowing isolated nodes that can't maintain proper network connectivity to pass health checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Latency] [Latency threshold bypass] Can LatencyChecker be configured with extremely high latency thresholds, allowing nodes with unacceptable response times to appear healthy and degrade overall network performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Handshake] [Handshake bypass] Can HandshakeChecker be disabled or misconfigured to allow nodes that fail proper network handshakes to be considered healthy, potentially allowing network protocol violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Hardware] [Resource requirement bypass] Can HardwareChecker be configured with minimal hardware requirements, allowing under-resourced nodes that will fail under load to pass initial health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/mod.rs] [CheckerConfig::Hardware] [Hardware spoofing] If HardwareChecker relies on self-reported metrics, can a node lie about its hardware capabilities to pass checks while actually being under-resourced? (High)"
