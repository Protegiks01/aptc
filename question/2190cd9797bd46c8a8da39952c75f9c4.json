  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Process lifecycle security] When the main() function exits (after line 22 completes), are all cryptographic keys properly zeroized from memory, all locks released, all file descriptors closed, and all network connections terminated to prevent information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Panic=unwind exploitation] If panic=unwind is configured (instead of panic=abort), can an attacker craft inputs that cause panics in the checks at lines 16-19, then exploit unwinding to bypass security boundaries or access uninitialized data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Binary tampering] Before the feature checks at lines 16-19 execute, is there any self-integrity verification of the running binary's hash, signature, or code sections to detect if an attacker has patched the executable to bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Runtime patching] Can an attacker use LD_PRELOAD, DLL injection, ptrace, or other runtime code modification techniques to intercept the calls at lines 16-19-22 and return false-positive validation results? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Reproducible build verification] Can validators independently verify that their binary matches the official release by checking that the feature assertions at lines 16-19 use known-good function implementations, or can supply chain attacks introduce malicious versions of these checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Startup logging gaps] When the feature checks at lines 16-19 execute, are their results logged to an audit trail, or can an attacker bypass these checks silently without leaving evidence for forensic analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error context leakage] If the assertions at lines 16-19 fail and panic, do the panic messages or stack traces reveal sensitive information about the build environment, feature flags, or internal implementation details that aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Container escape] If this node runs in a container, can an attacker exploit the minimal main() logic to escape the container before the full node security controls in run() are established? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-node/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege dropping] Does main() or the run() call at line 22 properly drop privileges after initial setup, or does the node continue running with unnecessary elevated permissions that expand the attack surface? (Medium)"
