  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::add()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker cause integer overflow by passing a very large timeout value that, when added to the current timestamp at line 35, exceeds i64::MAX, causing wrap-around and premature expiration of critical consensus data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::add()] [Time Manipulation] Can a malicious validator exploit system clock skew or NTP manipulation to inject items with artificially early expiry times (line 35), causing them to expire immediately and potentially bypassing quorum store batch validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Race Condition] Is there a race condition between multiple concurrent calls to expire() at line 39-57 where the VecDeque is drained, potentially causing double-removal or partial expiration that could lead to state inconsistency across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the system clock backward after items are added, preventing expire() from ever returning items at line 41-50, effectively freezing quorum store batches and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::add()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any limit on the size of the VecDeque at line 36, allowing an attacker to add unlimited timeout entries and exhaust validator memory, causing crashes and network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Integer Underflow] Can negative timeout values or system clock manipulation cause cur_time at line 41 to be less than stored expiration_time values added earlier, preventing legitimate expiration and permanently blocking batch processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::add()] [Determinism Violation] Does the use of Utc::now() at line 35 create non-deterministic behavior across validators with different system clocks, causing validators to expire items at different times and creating state divergence in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [Precision Loss] Can the millisecond-precision timestamp comparison at line 50 miss expiration windows during high-frequency calls, causing batches to remain unexpired longer than intended and affecting transaction ordering fairness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::add()] [Type Safety] Can type parameter T be instantiated with types that don't implement proper equality/hashing, causing the timeout mechanism to behave incorrectly when tracking critical consensus objects like batch proofs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: Timeouts::expire()] [DoS through Drain] Can an attacker flood the VecDeque with millions of timed-out items, making the drain operation at line 53-56 extremely slow and blocking the consensus thread, causing validator slowdown and potential safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::add_item()] [Heap Corruption] Can malicious validators insert items with duplicate expiry_time values at line 72, causing the BinaryHeap's min-heap invariant to be violated when using Reverse ordering, leading to incorrect expiration ordering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Unsafe Unwrap] The unwrap() at line 82 is marked as safe but relies on peek() check at line 80 - can a race condition between threads cause the heap to be modified between peek and pop, triggering a panic that crashes the validator node? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a certified_time value at line 78 that causes u64 overflow when compared with stored expiry times, allowing premature or delayed expiration of batches and breaking consensus timing assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::add_item()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any bound on the BinaryHeap size at line 72, allowing an attacker to add unlimited expiration entries and exhaust memory, causing validator crashes and potential network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Collision Attack] Can an attacker craft multiple items with identical hash values that insert into the HashSet at line 83, causing only one to be returned while others remain in the heap, creating state inconsistency in batch tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Determinism Violation] If certified_time at line 78 comes from different sources across validators (e.g., different certified timestamps), can validators expire different sets of batches, causing consensus state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::add_item()] [Ordering Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the Reverse wrapper at line 72 to manipulate batch expiration order by providing specially crafted u64 values near max value, causing important batches to expire prematurely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Incomplete Expiration] If the loop at line 80-87 is interrupted (panic, async cancellation), can partially-expired items remain in the heap while being added to the HashSet, causing duplicate tracking and state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::new()] [Type Confusion] Can the generic type I be instantiated with types that don't properly implement Ord and Hash, causing the BinaryHeap and HashSet to produce non-deterministic results across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/quorum_store/utils.rs] [Function: TimeExpirations::expire()] [Time Manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator provide a fraudulently high certified_time value at line 81 to force premature expiration of all batches, allowing the attacker to exclude competitor transactions and manipulate block composition?
