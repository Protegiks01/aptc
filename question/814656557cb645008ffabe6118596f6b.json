  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Native function complexity] Are there complexity limits on native function implementations registered through this file, or can computationally expensive natives block validator execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Multiple initialization] Can all_natives() be called multiple times during validator lifecycle, and if so, does this cause memory leaks or allow re-registration of natives with different implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Builder state pollution] If the SafeNativeBuilder has mutable state, can previous calls to make_all() pollute the builder state and affect subsequent native registrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Framework address race] Can the framework_addr parameter be different across validators during initial synchronization, causing non-deterministic native function resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Type argument validation] Do registered natives properly validate type arguments, or can generic type confusion attacks exploit natives registered through this table? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Return value consistency] Are native function return values from all modules type-checked consistently, or can incorrect return types cause Move VM crashes or memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Argument count mismatch] If a native function is called with incorrect argument counts, does the registered native handle this safely, or can it cause stack corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Account + Object interaction] Can the interaction between account module natives (line 57) and object module natives (line 88) be exploited to create accounts that appear to own objects without proper resource accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Transaction context + Randomness] Can transaction_context natives (line 79-81) be combined with randomness natives (line 73) to enable replay attacks where randomness values are predetermined by transaction metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Code + State storage interaction] Can the code module (line 82) and state_storage module (line 84) be exploited together to deploy code that directly manipulates state storage, bypassing Move bytecode verification?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Unicode normalization] Are module name strings (e.g., 'account' at line 57) normalized consistently, or can Unicode normalization attacks cause two apparently different names to resolve to the same native function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Case sensitivity] Is module name matching case-sensitive, and can attackers register natives under 'Account' vs 'account' to shadow legitimate functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Whitespace handling] Can leading/trailing whitespace in module name strings cause lookup failures or allow duplicate registrations with visually identical names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Public vs private natives] Does the registration mechanism enforce visibility rules, or can private natives intended for framework use only be called by user contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Framework address enforcement] Do natives check that they're being called from modules at the framework_addr, or can user-deployed modules call privileged framework natives? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Empty native table] Can all_natives() return an empty table if all make_all() calls fail, and would this cause total Move VM failure and network halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-move/framework/src/natives/mod.rs] [Function: all_natives()] [Partial registration failure] If one module's make_all() panics or fails, does the registration continue with other modules, potentially creating an incomplete native table? (High)",
