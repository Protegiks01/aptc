  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [FieldCount Trait] [Field Count Mismatch] If FieldCount trait reports incorrect field count due to macro bugs, can this cause buffer overflows in bulk operations expecting specific field counts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Queryable] [Dirty Read] When querying AssetUploaderRequestStatusesQuery without proper transaction isolation, can dirty reads occur where uncommitted data from concurrent transactions is visible, causing inconsistent processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Query Load] [Non-Repeatable Read] In multi-step operations loading AssetUploaderRequestStatusesQuery then acting on it, can non-repeatable reads cause the data to change between read and action, breaking transaction integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: idempotency_key] [CRLF Injection] Can idempotency_key contain CRLF sequences (\\r\\n) that when logged or included in HTTP headers cause header injection attacks or log forgery? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: application_id] [Command Injection] If application_id is ever used in shell commands or system calls without proper escaping, can attackers inject shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Status Fields] [State Inconsistency] Can status_code, error_messages, and cdn_image_uri fields reach inconsistent states (e.g., status_code=200 but error_messages populated, or status_code=500 but cdn_image_uri set) causing logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Timestamp Consistency] [Clock Drift] Can request_received_at be later than inserted_at due to clock drift between systems, causing timestamp ordering assumptions to break and processing logic errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: num_failures] [Retry Bypass] Can attackers reset num_failures to 0 through direct database manipulation or API exploits to bypass retry limits and cause infinite upload attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Status Code] [Status Spoofing] Can attackers manipulate status_code values to mark failed uploads as successful (setting to 200) to pollute the CDN with malicious content or break NFT metadata integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [Array Index] If code accessing error_messages Vec assumes fixed indices without bounds checking, can out-of-bounds access cause panics or memory corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Field: error_messages] [Empty Array] When error_messages is Some(vec![]) (empty vector), can this edge case cause unwrap() panics or incorrect error handling logic that expects at least one error?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/nft-metadata-crawler/src/models/asset_uploader_request_statuses_query.rs] [Array Column] [PostgreSQL Array Injection] The error_messages field maps to PostgreSQL Array<Nullable<Text>> - can attackers inject malicious PostgreSQL array syntax through error messages to exploit array processing vulnerabilities?
