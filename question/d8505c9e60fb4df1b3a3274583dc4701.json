  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: start()] [Client reuse] Can GRPC clients be reused across multiple messages, or does each send create a new connection, causing port exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Mutable borrow] Does get_mut() on grpc_clients create exclusive borrows that prevent concurrent sends to different remote addresses? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Struct: OutboundHandler] [Service string] Is the _service String field actually unused, wasting memory for each OutboundHandler instance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/net/src/network_controller/outbound_handler.rs] [Function: process_one_outgoing_message()] [Timer scope] Does the _timer scoped timer measure only network send time, or does it include Select wait time, potentially skewing metrics? (Low)",
