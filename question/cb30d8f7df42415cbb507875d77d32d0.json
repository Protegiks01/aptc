  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage lifecycle] [Cache Reuse Attack] Can an attacker exploit UnsyncCodeStorage reuse across multiple transactions to build up a large cache of malicious scripts that consume validator resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ScriptCache] [Transaction Rollback] When transactions fail and rollback, does the script_cache also rollback its state, or can an attacker exploit permanent cache modifications from failed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache] [Sequential Execution Order] In sequential block execution, can an attacker order transactions to manipulate script_cache state, causing later transactions to execute under different cache conditions than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache with CompiledScript] [Deserialization Bomb] Can an attacker submit a script with specially crafted bytecode that causes exponential memory expansion during deserialization, crashing validators when cached? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ScriptCache] [Malformed Bytecode] Can an attacker bypass initial bounds checking to cache malformed CompiledScript bytecode that crashes the VM during execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache] [Bytecode Version Confusion] If script_cache stores scripts compiled with different Move VM versions, can an attacker exploit version mismatches to cause execution errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ScriptCache::insert_deserialized_script()] [Partial Deserialization] Can an attacker exploit partial deserialization failures to cache incomplete CompiledScript objects that cause undefined behavior during execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache with Script] [Verified Script Tampering] After a Script is verified and cached, can an attacker exploit any mutable fields to modify the verified script in cache, bypassing re-verification requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ModuleStorage for script dependencies] [Missing Dependency] Can an attacker cache a script that references non-existent modules, then later deploy those modules with malicious implementations to compromise the cached script? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: UnsyncCodeStorage combining both storages] [Dependency Version Lock] Does script_cache lock the versions of referenced modules from module_storage, or can an attacker upgrade modules to break previously cached scripts? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ScriptCache and ModuleStorage] [Cyclic Dependency] Can an attacker create cyclic dependencies between cached scripts and modules that cause infinite resolution loops or stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Struct: script_cache] [Dependency Shadowing] Can an attacker exploit the cache lookup order to shadow legitimate module dependencies with malicious modules that have the same ModuleId? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/implementations/unsync_code_storage.rs] [Delegation: ModuleStorage] [Transitive Dependency Attack] When a cached script depends on module A which depends on module B, can an attacker exploit unchecked transitive dependencies to inject malicious code? (High)",
