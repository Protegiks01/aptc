  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider trust] Does the target_metrics_provider properly authenticate and validate the metrics source, or can a MITM attacker inject fake metrics during the scrape? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider substitution] Can the ProviderCollection be manipulated to substitute a malicious MetricsProvider that always returns passing metrics regardless of actual node health? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Macro: get_provider!] [Type confusion] Can the get_provider! macro at line 99-103 be exploited with type confusion to return a provider of the wrong type that bypasses validation? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [False negatives] If allowed_consensus_timeouts is set very high (e.g., millions), can severely degraded consensus nodes pass checks despite experiencing critical failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Comparison semantics] Does the comparison logic properly handle the case where timeouts decrease (counter reset), or does it silently pass such anomalies as valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/consensus_timeouts.rs] [Function: build_check_result()] [Score calculation] The passing score is hardcoded to 100 (line 82) and failing to 50 (line 73) - can this scoring system be gamed by nodes that repeatedly fail and pass to maintain average scores?
