  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Struct: StructKey] [Index exhaustion] If StructNameIndex is bounded, can exhausting the index space prevent new structs from being cached, causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Struct: StructKey] [Cross-module collision] Can two different modules define structs with names that produce colliding StructNameIndex values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Struct: StructKey] [Index manipulation] Can an attacker craft module bytecode that forces specific StructNameIndex values to cause cache collisions with system structs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Function: LayoutCache::get_struct_layout()] [Null handling] If get_struct_layout() returns None, do all callers handle it correctly, or can None be misinterpreted as a valid empty layout? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Function: NoOpLayoutCache::get_struct_layout()] [Unconditional None] Since NoOpLayoutCache always returns None, can this cause different execution paths than real cache implementations, breaking test coverage? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/storage/layout_cache.rs] [Trait: LayoutCache] [Trait object safety] Is LayoutCache object-safe, and can it be used through dyn references in concurrent contexts without undefined behavior? (Medium)",
