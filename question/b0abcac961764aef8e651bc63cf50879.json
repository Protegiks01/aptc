  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Dependency: curve25519_dalek] [Point decompression] When decompressing Ed25519 points in from_ed25519_public_bytes(), could the curve25519_dalek library have bugs that accept invalid points or handle edge cases incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Dependency: ed25519_dalek] [ExpandedSecretKey exposure] The use of ed25519_dalek::ExpandedSecretKey exposes internal key expansion - could this leak information about the Ed25519 key that wouldn't be exposed through normal Ed25519 operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Constant: SHARED_SECRET_SIZE] [Size validation] Is the SHARED_SECRET_SIZE constant validated to match the actual output of x25519_dalek, or could library updates change output size causing buffer issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PrivateKey] [Thread safety] Although PrivateKey doesn't implement Clone in production, if multiple threads access the same PrivateKey reference, could concurrent calls to diffie_hellman() create race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Concurrent modification] PublicKey implements Copy and Clone, but if shared across threads, could concurrent operations on the underlying bytes cause inconsistent reads or writes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: generate()] [RNG state] If generate() is called concurrently from multiple threads with a shared RNG, could race conditions in the RNG state cause colliding or predictable keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Concurrent calls] If the same PrivateKey is used for multiple concurrent diffie_hellman() operations, could internal state in the dalek library cause incorrect shared secrets? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: Arbitrary for PrivateKey] [Fuzzing coverage] Does the proptest Arbitrary implementation for PrivateKey generate edge cases like all-zeros, all-ones, or specific bit patterns that could reveal vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: Arbitrary for PublicKey] [Invalid keys in fuzzing] The Arbitrary implementation for PublicKey can generate arbitrary bytes - does fuzzing with invalid curve points reveal crashes or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: keypair_strategy()] [Test determinism] Does the keypair_strategy() function used in tests properly exercise all code paths, or could production bugs exist that are not covered by deterministic test cases? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Feature: fuzzing] [Clone availability] The Clone trait for PrivateKey is only available under fuzzing feature - could this create divergence between test and production code behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: PartialEq for PrivateKey] [Comparison side-channel] The PartialEq implementation compares private key bytes - even though it's test-only, could this pattern leak into production code and enable timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PrivateKey] [Type confusion] Could type confusion between PrivateKey and other key types (Ed25519, BLS) occur in the codebase due to similar serialization formats, enabling key substitution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Struct: PublicKey] [Type mixing] PublicKey implements many traits automatically - could this enable mixing of X25519 public keys with other key types in collections or APIs, breaking cryptographic assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: ValidCryptoMaterial] [to_bytes() consistency] Do all ValidCryptoMaterial implementations maintain consistent byte representations, or could different serialization paths produce different bytes for the same key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Derive: SilentDebug/SilentDisplay] [Accidental exposure] Are there any code paths where the SilentDebug/SilentDisplay protections could be bypassed, causing private keys to be logged? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: PrivateKey] [Associated type] The PrivateKey trait uses PublicKeyMaterial as an associated type - could incorrect trait bounds allow wrong public key types to be associated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Trait: PublicKey] [Associated type] Similarly, PublicKey trait associates PrivateKeyMaterial - could this enable type system bypasses if trait bounds are not properly enforced? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: as_slice()] [Lifetime extension] Does as_slice() return a reference with appropriate lifetime bounds, or could dangling references to public key bytes be created? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: diffie_hellman()] [Temporary exposure] The shared secret is returned as owned bytes - are there intermediate allocations during this process where sensitive data could be leaked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: public_key()] [Ownership transfer] When public_key() creates a new PublicKey, could the intermediate x25519_dalek::PublicKey leave uncleared memory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: to_bytes() for PrivateKey] [Vector allocation] Returning Vec<u8> from to_bytes() creates a new allocation - could this enable memory-based side-channels or leave key material in deallocated memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: to_bytes() for PublicKey] [Unnecessary cloning] The to_bytes() for PublicKey clones the array - could this be exploited to exhaust memory if called repeatedly on the same key? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_private_bytes()] [Panic in ed25519_dalek] If ed25519_dalek::SecretKey::from_bytes() panics instead of returning an error for invalid input, could this crash validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/x25519.rs] [Function: from_ed25519_public_bytes()] [Panic in decompression] Could the decompress() operation on CompressedEdwardsY panic for certain malformed inputs instead of returning None? (Medium)"
