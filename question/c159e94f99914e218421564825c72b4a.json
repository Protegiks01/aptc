  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<io::Error>] [Error Code Confusion] Does the io::Error to InternalError conversion properly distinguish between different error types (permission denied vs not found vs corruption), or can attackers exploit ambiguous error handling to trigger unexpected recovery behaviors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<bcs::Error>] [Deserialization Attack] Can maliciously crafted BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization) payloads trigger errors that expose validator key material in error messages, or cause parsers to enter unsafe states during Move resource serialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<bcs::Error>] [Type Safety Bypass] Does BCS error conversion validate that serialization failures represent actual invalid data vs attempts to serialize privileged types, preventing type confusion attacks in Move VM key access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<bcs::Error>] [Consensus Divergence] Can BCS serialization errors cause different validators to deserialize key metadata differently, leading to inconsistent key version tracking or rotation state across the validator set? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<serde_json::Error>] [JSON Injection] Can attackers inject malformed JSON during key export/import operations that triggers errors containing executable JavaScript or command injection payloads in error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<serde_json::Error>] [Large Number Handling] Does JSON error conversion properly handle integer overflow or precision loss in numeric fields like key versions or timestamps, preventing attackers from causing wraparound errors during key selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error>] [Vault Client Bypass] Can attackers craft requests that trigger specific vault client errors that get misclassified during conversion, bypassing permission checks or key access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error>] [NotFound Error Handling] Does the NotFound error conversion properly validate the key parameter before storing it in KeyNotSet, or can attackers inject malicious key names that corrupt error handling or leak through to other systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error>] [HTTP 403 Handling] Is the HTTP 403 error correctly mapped to PermissionDenied in all contexts, or can attackers trigger 403 responses that should represent different error conditions, bypassing rate limiting or audit logging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error>] [Catch-All Error Handling] Does the catch-all '_' pattern properly sanitize error messages from vault client before converting to InternalError, or can attackers inject vault-specific error details that leak sensitive configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [From<aptos_vault_client::Error>] [Error Pattern Matching] Can attackers exploit the specific error pattern matching order to cause misclassification of errors, such as crafting a 403 response that also matches NotFound conditions, leading to incorrect permission enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Serde Derive Macros] [Deserialization Bomb] Can the derived Deserialize implementation for Error enum be exploited with deeply nested or cyclic error structures that cause stack overflow during error deserialization from network messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Serde Derive Macros] [Tag Confusion] Does the serde tag attribute properly prevent attackers from crafting serialized errors with mismatched tags that cause type confusion when errors are deserialized across validator boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [PartialEq Implementation] [Timing Side Channel] Does the derived PartialEq comparison expose timing side channels when comparing error strings containing key names or sensitive paths, enabling attackers to infer key existence through error comparison timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::InternalError String Formatting] [Context Loss] When converting from io::Error to InternalError using format!, does critical context like error codes or source locations get lost, making it impossible to distinguish security-critical failures from benign errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::SerializationError String Formatting] [Stack Trace Leakage] Do serialization errors include full stack traces or file paths in the formatted string that leak validator node directory structure or code version information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [All Error Variants] [Error Chain Breaking] When converting external errors to internal Error enum variants, does the conversion preserve the full error chain for debugging, or can information loss hide the root cause of key operation failures during incident response? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error Enum] [Non-Atomic Error Creation] Can concurrent operations create the same error variant with different string parameters simultaneously, causing race conditions in error logging or error recovery logic that lead to incorrect failure handling?

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [KeyAlreadyExists & KeyNotSet] [TOCTOU Vulnerability] Can time-of-check-time-of-use race conditions between KeyNotSet checks and key creation operations allow attackers to exploit KeyAlreadyExists error windows to inject malicious keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::KeyVersionNotFound] [Version Race Condition] During concurrent key rotation operations, can KeyVersionNotFound errors be triggered in race windows that cause different validators to commit to different key versions, breaking consensus signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::PermissionDenied] [Recovery Bypass] Does error handling code properly treat PermissionDenied as unrecoverable, or can retry logic attempt to recover from permission errors in ways that eventually succeed through timing attacks or cached credential reuse? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::InternalError] [Inconsistent Recovery] When InternalError is returned from key signing operations, can inconsistent recovery logic across validators cause some to retry successfully while others fail, leading to missing signatures and consensus stalls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [All Error Variants] [Error State Persistence] Are error states properly persisted during validator crashes, or can error recovery after restart cause validators to forget about failed key operations and retry them with different outcomes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/error.rs] [Error::EntropyError] [RNG Failure Handling] When entropy collection fails and returns EntropyError, does the system properly halt key generation, or can continued operation lead to deterministic key generation that enables key prediction attacks?
