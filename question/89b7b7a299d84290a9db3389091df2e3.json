  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Attack Scenario] [State Rollback Attack] If errors occur after partial state updates, could an attacker exploit incomplete rollback to corrupt the blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Error Amplification] Can triggering one ExecutorError cause cascading failures that amplify into system-wide issues, effectively achieving denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Attack Scenario] [Error Message Crafting] Could an attacker craft inputs that generate specific error messages to confuse monitoring systems or hide attack patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Memory Safety] [String Allocation] Do the String fields in InternalError and SerializationError properly limit allocation sizes to prevent memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Memory Safety] [Clone Cost] When cloning ExecutorError instances with large error strings, could this cause performance degradation or memory pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Memory Safety] [Error Accumulation] If errors are collected in vectors or other containers, could this lead to unbounded memory growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Empty String Errors] What happens if InternalError or SerializationError contains empty strings - could this cause issues in error handling or logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Maximum usize] In BadNumTxnsToCommit, if to_commit is usize::MAX, could arithmetic operations overflow when added to Version values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Null Bytes] Do error strings properly handle null bytes or other special characters that could cause parsing issues in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Edge Case] [Unicode Handling] Are error strings properly validated for valid UTF-8, or could invalid Unicode cause panics or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Recovery] [Idempotency] Can operations that failed with ExecutorError be safely retried, or could retries cause duplicate effects or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Recovery] [Partial Execution] If BadNumTxnsToCommit is triggered, does this guarantee that zero transactions were committed, or could partial commits have occurred? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Recovery] [Error Persistence] Are ExecutorError instances logged or persisted in a way that allows forensic analysis after attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Integration] [Error Boundary] Does ExecutorError properly isolate failures, or could errors in one transaction affect the execution of subsequent unrelated transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Integration] [Cross-Module Errors] When ExecutorError crosses module boundaries, is the error context preserved or could important security information be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-types/src/error.rs] [Integration] [API Exposure] If ExecutorError is exposed through public APIs, could error details leak sensitive validator information to external observers? (Medium)"
