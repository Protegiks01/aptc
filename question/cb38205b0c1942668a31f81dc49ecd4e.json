  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: new()] [Private key exposure] In the TpsChecker constructor, the mint key from coin_source_args is validated but not sanitized - can an attacker inject a malicious private key that gets logged or leaked through error messages, potentially exposing the root minting authority? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [Cryptographic key leakage] The coin_source_args field containing Ed25519PrivateKey is marked for CLI/file input - does the deserialization process properly zero out key material from memory after use, or can keys be recovered from heap dumps or swap files? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: new()] [Key validation bypass] The constructor only checks if get_private_key() returns Ok but doesn't validate the key's cryptographic properties - can an attacker supply a weak, malformed, or all-zeros private key that passes validation but enables unlimited minting when used? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: CoinSourceArgs] [Key injection attack] Since coin_source_args is flattened in serde deserialization, can an attacker exploit JSON/YAML parsing to inject multiple private keys or override the intended minting key with a compromised one? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Key reuse vulnerability] The same coin_source_args private key is used repeatedly across multiple transaction emissions - does this create a timing attack surface where key operations can be observed to extract the private key through side channels? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Chain ID mismatch attack] The code comments claim baseline and target have same chain ID, but no explicit verification occurs - can an attacker return a different chain_id from the target node API to trick the checker into minting coins on the wrong network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Chain ID manipulation] The chain_id is obtained from target_api_index_provider.provide() without cryptographic verification - can a man-in-the-middle attacker intercept this API call and substitute a malicious chain ID to redirect minting operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Cross-chain replay attack] Since the chain_id validation is only a comment assumption, can an attacker replay TPS check transactions from testnet to mainnet or vice versa, potentially minting unlimited coins on production chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Chain ID spoofing] The ChainId::new() constructor takes a raw u8 without validation - can an attacker supply an invalid chain ID (e.g., 0, 255, or non-existent chain) that bypasses safety checks in downstream transaction emission? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [TPS inflation attack] The emit_transactions_with_cluster() function returns stats that include rate.submitted and rate.committed - can a malicious target node artificially inflate these values by accepting but not executing transactions to pass TPS requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Transaction replay vulnerability] The transaction emitter mints and sends transactions using the same coin source repeatedly - are nonces/sequence numbers properly incremented, or can an attacker replay minted transactions to drain the source account? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Double-spending in TPS test] If the target node is Byzantine, can it accept the same transaction multiple times in its committed count while only processing it once, artificially boosting TPS metrics to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Unlimited minting vulnerability] The transaction emitter uses coin_source_args to mint coins for TPS testing - are there rate limits or caps on minting, or can a compromised checker mint unlimited APT tokens during extended TPS evaluations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Transaction censorship bypass] Can a malicious target node selectively process only the checker's transactions while censoring user transactions, achieving high TPS in testing but low TPS in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Float to integer overflow] The rate.submitted and rate.committed are f64 values cast to u64 in comparisons and error messages - can extremely large float values (e.g., f64::MAX) cause integer overflow when cast, bypassing TPS validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Minimum TPS bypass via underflow] The comparison 'rate.submitted < (self.config.minimum_tps as f64)' uses implicit casting - can an attacker set minimum_tps to 0 or cause underflow conditions to bypass TPS requirements entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [Negative TPS injection] Since rate values are f64, can a malicious stats implementation return negative values for rate.submitted or rate.committed that pass validation checks due to incorrect comparison logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [NaN/Infinity TPS bypass] Can the stats.rate() function return NaN or Infinity values that bypass all comparison checks (since NaN != NaN and Infinity comparisons behave unexpectedly), allowing any node to pass TPS validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [repeat_target_count overflow] The repeat_target_count (usize) is used to duplicate target URLs - can an attacker set this to usize::MAX causing memory exhaustion when creating the targets vector, leading to DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [deny_unknown_fields bypass] The config uses #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] but nested structures might not - can an attacker inject malicious configuration fields into emit_config or coin_source_args that override security settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: TpsCheckerConfig] [minimum_tps validation] The minimum_tps field (u64) has no bounds checking - can an attacker set it to 0 or u64::MAX to either disable validation or cause integer overflow in comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: default_repeat_target_count()] [Default value exploitation] The default repeat_target_count is 1, but can this be overridden at runtime to 0, causing empty target vectors and bypassing all TPS checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Struct: EmitArgs] [Flattened config injection] emit_config and emit_workload_configs are flattened via serde - can an attacker inject overlapping field names that override critical security parameters like gas limits or transaction counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: new()] [Constructor bypass] The new() constructor only validates the private key exists but doesn't check if other config fields are valid - can an attacker create a TpsChecker with malformed emit_config that crashes during check()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/tps.rs] [Function: check()] [URL injection attack] The target_url is built using client.build_path('/').unwrap() - can an attacker manipulate the base URL in the provider to inject malicious URLs (e.g., 'javascript:', 'file://') that bypass validation? (High)"
