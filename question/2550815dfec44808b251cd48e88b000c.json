  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Round transitions] When moving transactions to new rounds during discarding, can tracker state become inconsistent if mark_txn_ordered is called with old round_id values? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Range query cost] Can an attacker craft shard boundaries that force expensive O(n) range queries for every transaction, causing quadratic complexity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Lock duration] Can an attacker craft transactions that hold tracker locks for extended periods, blocking other transactions and causing liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Type confusion] PrePartitionedTxnIdx and OriginalTxnIdx are both usize - can mixing them up in tracker operations cause incorrect conflict tracking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [ShardId validation] There's no validation that shard_id in mark_txn_ordered is < num_executor_shards - can out-of-bounds shard IDs corrupt the partition matrix? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [RoundId validation] Can negative or extremely large round_id values in mark_txn_ordered cause integer overflow in ShardedTxnIndexV2 comparisons? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Test function] [Wrapped range testing] The test only covers simple wrapped range cases - can complex multi-shard wraparound scenarios expose bugs not caught by tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Test function] [Concurrent testing] The test is single-threaded - can race conditions only manifest under concurrent access that tests don't cover? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Test function] [Negative testing] Tests don't cover error cases like calling mark_txn_ordered without prior add_candidate - are these scenarios properly handled? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/conflicting_txn_tracker.rs] [Overall design] [Consensus disagreement] If validators disagree on tracker state due to non-determinism, can this cause consensus to fail or validators to produce different state roots? (Critical)",
