  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [State recovery] When the indexer crashes due to the panic at line 28, can the database be left in an inconsistent state that prevents proper recovery when the correct processor is selected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Config validation] Does the IndexerConfig validation occur before from_string() is called at runtime.rs line 132, or can invalid configurations reach this function and trigger the panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Default processor] Is there a safe default processor that should be used when from_string() receives invalid input, rather than panicking and halting the entire indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Config injection] Can environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files be manipulated to inject malicious processor names that bypass validation before reaching from_string()? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Resource exhaustion] Can selecting specific processor types via from_string() cause excessive resource consumption (memory, CPU, database connections) compared to others, enabling DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Dependency injection] Are the processor implementations instantiated at runtime.rs lines 133-144 properly validated and sandboxed, or can malicious processor selection lead to arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Error propagation] When from_string() panics at line 28, does this properly propagate error information to monitoring systems, or does it fail silently leaving operators unaware of configuration issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Audit logging] Does from_string() log processor selection decisions for security auditing, or can malicious processor changes go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Rate limiting] Is there rate limiting on processor instantiation via from_string() to prevent rapid processor switching attacks that could destabilize the indexer? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Validation bypass] Can the from_string() function be bypassed entirely by directly constructing Processor enum variants, circumventing any intended validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Enum: Processor] [Feature flags] Are processor types protected by feature flags or capability checks, or can deprecated/experimental processors be selected via from_string() causing security issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Constants: NAME imports] [Name collision] Can processor NAME constants imported at lines 10-11 collide with each other, causing from_string() to select the wrong processor type? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Constants: NAME imports] [Const manipulation] Are the NAME constants immutable and integrity-protected, or can they be modified at runtime to cause incorrect processor selection via from_string()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [String interning] Does Rust's string interning or deduplication affect the string comparison at lines 23-27, potentially causing unexpected matching behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Memory leaks] Can repeated calls to from_string() with invalid processor names cause memory leaks due to panic unwinding or error handling issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/mod.rs] [Function: from_string()] [Use-after-free] Could the input_str reference at line 22 become dangling or invalid during string matching, causing memory safety issues? (Medium)",
