  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: transactions] [Incomplete List] Can transactions vec contain fewer transactions than (last_version - first_version + 1) due to max_page_size truncation without warning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: transactions] [Duplicate Transactions] Can the same TransactionOnChainData appear multiple times in transactions vec causing state replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: transactions] [Wrong Block] Can transactions from different blocks be included in the wrong Block, causing state verification failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: transactions] [Null Handling] Is Option<Vec<Transaction>> properly distinguished from Some(Vec::new()), or can empty vec be misinterpreted as None? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Microsecond Precision] Can block_timestamp microsecond precision cause timestamp collisions when blocks are produced rapidly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Epoch Overflow] Can block_timestamp overflow Unix epoch representation in the year 2262+, causing timestamp wraparound? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Zero Timestamp] Can block_timestamp be zero (Unix epoch 0) for non-genesis blocks, bypassing timing constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_timestamp] [Future Timestamp] Can block_timestamp be set far in the future, allowing validators to manipulate consensus timing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_hash] [Weak Hash] Is block_hash computed using cryptographically secure hash function resistant to pre-image and collision attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_hash] [Zero Hash] Can block_hash be all zeros (null hash) for non-genesis blocks, causing hash collision with uninitialized state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_hash] [Hash Validation] Is block_hash length validated to be exactly 32 bytes (256 bits) for aptos_crypto::HashValue compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_height] [Height Reorg] Can block_height decrease during chain reorganization, and is this properly handled without state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_height] [Height Skip] Can block_height skip values (e.g., height 99 → 101), breaking linear block history assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Field: block_height] [Genesis Height] Is block_height=0 enforced for genesis block only, or can other blocks falsely claim genesis height? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Derive: Object] [Required Fields] Are all non-optional Block fields marked as required in OpenAPI spec, preventing partial block construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/block.rs] [Struct: Block] [OpenAPI Documentation] Does OpenAPI schema properly document the relationship between first_version, last_version, and transactions length? (Low)"
