  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Trait implementation vulnerability] Can a malicious CoinType implementation provide inconsistent type_tag() results across different calls, causing non-deterministic resource paths and state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: set_coin()] [Direct manipulation] Can set_coin() be called by unauthorized Move modules to directly modify balances without proper deposit/withdraw validation, bypassing all accounting and event emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: new()] [Unauthorized instantiation] Can new() be called by malicious Move code to create CoinStore instances with arbitrary initial balances, effectively minting unlimited coins without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Struct: CoinStoreResource] [Public mutability] Are the mutable accessors (deposit_events_mut, withdraw_events_mut) callable by any Move module, allowing attackers to corrupt event streams of victim accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: coin()] [Unauthorized read] Can coin() be used to read balances from arbitrary accounts without access control, enabling privacy violations and targeted attacks on high-value holders? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [All methods] [Module-level access] Does lack of Move native access control in Rust definitions mean any Move module can call these methods, requiring consuming code to enforce all security policies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: set_coin()] [State race] In parallel execution (Block-STM), can concurrent calls to set_coin() on the same account cause lost updates where the last write wins, resulting in incorrect final balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Struct: CoinStoreResource] [Non-atomic operations] Are coin field updates and event emissions non-atomic, allowing transaction abortion after partial state changes that corrupt balance-to-event consistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: deposit_events_mut()] [Concurrent mutation] Can deposit_events_mut() be called concurrently with event emission, causing race conditions where events are emitted on wrong handles or with corrupted metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Multiple functions] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between reading frozen() and performing operations on coin, can state changes cause time-of-check-time-of-use bugs where frozen accounts are drained? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Field: coin] [Dirty read] In parallel execution, can one transaction read a partially committed coin value from another transaction, causing inconsistent balance observations and double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Resource duplication] Does MoveResource trait implementation prevent duplication, or can attackers clone CoinStore instances to create multiple copies of the same coins? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Trait: MoveResource] [Resource destruction] Can CoinStore be dropped without proper cleanup, causing coins to be permanently destroyed and violating total supply invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Struct: CoinStoreResourceUntyped] [Type safety escape] Does CoinStoreResourceUntyped provide an escape hatch to bypass Move's linear type system, allowing coin duplication through untyped operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Field: phantom_data] [Resource semantics] Does PhantomData correctly enforce Move's resource semantics, or can its zero-cost abstraction be exploited to violate single-ownership guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [All fields] [Move-copy violation] Can any fields marked as 'copy' in Move be exploited to copy CoinStore resources, violating Move's resource safety and enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Const: MODULE_NAME] [Module impersonation] Can an attacker create a malicious module named 'coin' that intercepts CoinStore operations by exploiting MODULE_NAME constant matching in resource lookups? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Const: STRUCT_NAME] [Struct name collision] Does STRUCT_NAME='CoinStore' allow malicious modules to create conflicting struct definitions that share resource paths with legitimate CoinStore instances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Function: type_args()] [Cross-contract call] Can external contracts manipulate type_args() during cross-module calls to cause the Move VM to resolve wrong resource types, enabling theft from misidentified accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Struct: CoinStoreResource] [Reentrancy] If deposit/withdraw operations in coin.move call back into attacker contracts, can reentrancy attacks manipulate CoinStore state mid-operation to cause inconsistent balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [All methods] [Callback exploitation] Can malicious Move modules register callbacks that execute during CoinStore mutations, allowing them to observe or modify state at invalid intermediate points? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/resources/coin_store.rs] [Field: deposit_events] [Event ordering] Can deposit_events emit events out of chronological order during parallel execution, causing indexers to compute incorrect balance histories? (Medium)",
