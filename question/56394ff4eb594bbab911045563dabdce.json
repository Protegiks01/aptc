  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Context] [Source Validation] When IO errors occur, is the source of the configuration file validated (only trusted paths, proper permissions), or can errors mask attempts to load configs from attacker-controlled locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Error Source] [Config Precedence] If multiple configuration sources exist (environment variables, config files, command line), can error handling in one source bypass security checks by falling through to less-secure sources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Side Channel] [Timing Attacks] Can attackers measure timing differences between different error types (ConfigSanitizerFailed vs Missing vs IO) to infer the presence or absence of specific configuration files or values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Side Channel] [Error Enumeration] By systematically triggering different error conditions, can attackers map out the expected configuration structure and identify missing security controls? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Side Channel] [Resource Consumption] Do different error paths have significantly different resource consumption patterns that could be used for fingerprinting or to cause targeted performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [External Integration] [Secure Backend Failures] When errors occur loading configurations from secure backends (vault, KMS), are temporary failures distinguished from permanent errors to avoid accidentally falling back to insecure local storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [External Integration] [Network Dependency] If configuration loading depends on external services (config servers, secret managers), can network errors during startup cause nodes to start with stale or incomplete configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [External Integration] [Certificate Validation] When loading configurations over network connections, are certificate validation errors (IO errors) properly distinguished from network errors to prevent MITM attacks on config distribution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Move Integration] [Native Function Errors] When InvariantViolation errors occur in Move native functions, can this cause non-deterministic transaction execution where some validators abort but others continue? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Move Integration] [Gas Metering] If errors occur during gas configuration loading, can this cause validators to use different gas schedules, leading to divergent execution results and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Move Integration] [Resource Safety] Can InvariantViolation errors in aggregator or event native functions bypass Move's resource safety guarantees, allowing double-spending or resource duplication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Network Transmission] [Error Propagation Protocol] When configuration errors need to be transmitted between nodes (e.g., in distributed config management), are errors properly serialized without leaking sensitive data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Network Transmission] [DoS via Error Flooding] Can remote nodes trigger configuration reloads or validation that generate errors, causing local resource exhaustion or log flooding? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Network Transmission] [Deserialization Safety] If error objects are deserialized from network messages, can malicious error payloads exploit deserialization vulnerabilities in error handling code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dynamic Updates] [Hot Reload Errors] If configurations support hot reloading, can errors during reload cause the node to operate with a mix of old and new configs, creating security inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dynamic Updates] [Rollback Safety] When configuration updates fail and need to be rolled back, can errors during rollback leave the system in an undefined state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dynamic Updates] [Atomic Config Changes] Are configuration changes atomic across all components, or can errors in one component leave other components with partially-applied configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Testing] [Error Injection] Can error injection for testing purposes (failpoints) accidentally be enabled in production through configuration errors that bypass sanitization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Testing] [Mock Configurations] If test configurations with mock security settings accidentally get loaded in production, will appropriate errors be generated and prevent startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Testing] [Coverage Gaps] Are all error variants properly tested in security-critical code paths, or can untested error conditions lead to undefined behavior in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dependencies] [thiserror Vulnerabilities] Does the error handling depend on the thiserror crate in a way that could be affected by vulnerabilities in error derivation macros? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dependencies] [serde_yaml Security] Are there known vulnerabilities in serde_yaml error handling that could be triggered through malicious YAML configs, and are error paths properly isolated from these? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Dependencies] [bcs Deserialization] Can malformed BCS data trigger panics or undefined behavior in the bcs crate that bypass normal error handling? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Resilience] [Graceful Degradation] When non-critical configuration components fail, does the system gracefully degrade with appropriate errors, or can errors cascade causing total system failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/error.rs] [Resilience] [Error Rate Limiting] Are there rate limits on how frequently configuration errors can be generated to prevent error storms that could mask attacks or cause performance degradation? (Low)"
