  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [Allocation pattern] Does BooleanTransactionFilter::new_from_proto() allocate all filter data upfront or lazily, and can attackers exploit eager allocation to cause memory spikes? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [CPU exhaustion] Can complex filter validation in new_from_proto() take excessive CPU time, allowing attackers to slow down indexer request processing with valid but complex filters? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [Address parsing vulnerability] Can malformed address strings in filters cause panics in standardize_address() during filter validation, crashing the service before returning Status error? (Medium)",
  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [Module name injection] Can special characters or path traversal sequences in module/function name filters cause unexpected behavior in string matching logic? (Low)",

  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [AND short-circuit bypass] Do LogicalAnd filters properly short-circuit evaluation, or do they evaluate all sub-filters even when early filters don't match, wasting resources? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [OR short-circuit bypass] Do LogicalOr filters short-circuit on first match, or do they evaluate all sub-filters allowing timing attacks to infer filter structure? (Low)",
  "[File: ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-utils/src/filter_utils.rs] [Function: parse_transaction_filter()] [Filter combination explosion] Can an attacker combine multiple filter types (TransactionRoot + UserTransaction + Event) in complex AND/OR trees to create filters that individually pass size limits but collectively overwhelm the matcher?
