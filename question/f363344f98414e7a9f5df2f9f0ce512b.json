  "[File: consensus/src/payload_client/mod.rs] [Trait: PayloadClient::pull_payload()] [Type confusion] Can a malicious implementation of PayloadClient return mismatched validator transaction and payload types that violate consensus assumptions, causing state inconsistency across validators? (Critical)",
