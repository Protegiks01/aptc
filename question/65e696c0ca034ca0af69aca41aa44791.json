  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Parameter slicing vulnerability] The check &lhs.param_tys()[0..lhs.param_count() - 1] == rhs.param_tys() - can integer underflow in param_count() - 1 when param_count is 0 cause out-of-bounds access? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Empty parameter bypass] If lhs.param_tys().is_empty(), the function aborts with code 2 - is this check sufficient, or can attackers pass functions with only the &FunctionInfo parameter to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Visibility bypass] The function requires rhs.is_public() - can attackers exploit module friend relationships or package visibility rules to make private functions appear public? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Native function injection] The check !rhs.is_native() prevents native functions - can attackers craft bytecode that appears non-native but actually invokes native operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Module ID equality] The check lhs_id != rhs_id prevents self-dispatch - but can attackers deploy identical modules at different addresses to bypass this check while creating infinite recursion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Abort code collision] Both module loading failures return abort code 2 - can this ambiguity be exploited to hide which validation check actually failed, aiding attacker reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Boolean coercion] The function returns Value::bool() with a complex boolean expression - can the order of operations in the && chain be exploited to short-circuit validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Load order dependency] rhs is loaded before lhs - does this ordering matter for security, or can reversing the order cause different traversal context states leading to bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Type arguments ignored] The _ty_args parameter is unused - can attackers exploit generic type parameters to create functions that appear compatible but have different monomorphized implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Debug assertion bypass] debug_assert!(arguments.len() == 2) is only checked in debug builds - can attackers exploit incorrect argument counts in production to cause memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_check_dispatch_type_compatibility_impl()] [Concurrent module loading] If multiple transactions simultaneously call load_function() for the same module, can race conditions in the VM's loader cache cause inconsistent type information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Gas exhaustion] The function charges FUNCTION_INFO_CHECK_IS_IDENTIFIER_PER_BYTE * length - can attackers provide extremely long strings to cause integer overflow in NumBytes::new() leading to free validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [UTF-8 bypass] The function uses std::str::from_utf8() before Identifier::is_valid() - can attackers craft byte sequences that are valid UTF-8 but bypass identifier validation rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Identifier rules inconsistency] Does Identifier::is_valid() apply the same rules as Move compiler identifier parsing, or can discrepancies allow on-chain identifiers that can't be referenced in Move source? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Empty string validation] Can an attacker pass an empty vector to create empty identifiers that bypass module/function resolution checks causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Special character injection] Does is_valid() properly reject all special characters including null bytes, control characters, and Unicode directional markers that could enable injection attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Case sensitivity] Are identifier validations case-sensitive, or can attackers create homograph attacks using mixed case versions of system function names? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Length limits] Does Identifier::is_valid() enforce maximum length limits, or can arbitrarily long identifiers cause buffer overflows in downstream C++ VM code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Reserved keyword bypass] Can attackers use Move reserved keywords (e.g., 'move', 'script', 'module') as identifiers to confuse parsers or bypass access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Numeric prefix validation] Does the validation properly reject identifiers starting with numbers, or can '123_module' bypass checks and cause parser errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_is_identifier()] [Underscore rules] Are consecutive underscores or leading/trailing underscores properly rejected, or can '__system__' identifiers bypass namespace protections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/function_info.rs] [Function: native_load_function_impl()] [Gas metering bypass] The function has two paths - one with direct gas meter access charges dependencies, one returns LoadModule error - can attackers exploit the legacy path to load modules without proper gas charging?
