  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Attack: Split-view attack] Can Byzantine validators advertise different AdvertisedData to different peers, creating network partitions where nodes have inconsistent views of data availability? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Attack: Data withholding] Can malicious peers advertise that they have complete data ranges in transactions and states fields but refuse to serve the data, causing synchronization stalls and liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Attack: Range fragmentation] Can attackers advertise many small, non-contiguous ranges to fragment the advertised_ranges Vecs, making contains_range() checks extremely expensive and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Attack: Stale data attack] Can malicious nodes continue advertising old GlobalDataSummary data with outdated synced_ledger_infos, causing requesting nodes to sync to stale states and fall behind consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Attack: Ledger info forgery] Can attackers create fake LedgerInfoWithSignatures with invalid quorum certificates and inject them into synced_ledger_infos before cryptographic validation, compromising sync target selection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Performance: Vec growth] Can the Vecs in AdvertisedData (epoch_ending_ledger_infos, states, synced_ledger_infos, transactions, transaction_outputs) grow unbounded over time, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Performance: Clone cost] Does frequent cloning of GlobalDataSummary (which contains multiple nested Vecs and LedgerInfoWithSignatures) cause performance degradation in high-throughput scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Performance: PartialEq cost] Is the PartialEq comparison on AdvertisedData expensive when Vecs are large, and can attackers trigger frequent equality checks to cause CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Memory: LedgerInfo size] LedgerInfoWithSignatures can contain large BLS signature aggregations. Can attackers advertise many large ledger infos to cause memory pressure on aggregating nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Error handling: Panic paths] Does any of the arithmetic or iteration logic have paths that can panic (overflow, underflow, unwrap on None) when processing malicious input? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Edge case: Empty ranges] How do the various functions handle CompleteDataRange instances where lowest == highest (single-item ranges)? Can these cause off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Edge case: Duplicate ranges] If advertised_ranges contain duplicate CompleteDataRange values, does this cause redundant processing or incorrect availability assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Edge case: Negative ranges] Can CompleteDataRange represent invalid ranges where highest < lowest, and does the code detect and reject these? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Crypto: Signature verification timing] Does verification of LedgerInfoWithSignatures happen before they're added to GlobalDataSummary, or can unverified signatures be propagated through the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Consensus: Epoch consistency] Can AdvertisedData contain epoch_ending_ledger_infos and synced_ledger_infos from different epochs that are internally inconsistent, breaking epoch transition logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Consensus: Fork detection] Does the aggregation of synced_ledger_infos from multiple peers detect forks, or can Byzantine validators advertise conflicting ledger infos for the same version? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Consensus: Quorum requirements] When selecting highest_synced_ledger_info(), is there verification that sufficient honest validators signed it, or can minority factions' ledger infos be selected? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Rust: Unsafe code] Are there any unsafe blocks in this module or its dependencies that could cause undefined behavior with malicious inputs? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/aptos-data-client/src/global_summary.rs] [Struct: CompleteDataRange] [Range semantics] Are CompleteDataRange bounds inclusive on both ends, and is this consistently enforced, or can off-by-one errors cause missing data at boundaries? (Medium)",
