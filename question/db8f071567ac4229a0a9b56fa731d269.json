  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g1_projective_str_to_affine] [Modular reduction] If the input strings represent integers larger than the BN254 field modulus, does modular reduction occur correctly, or can this create unexpected points? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g1_projective_str_to_affine] [Negative coordinates] Can an attacker provide negative coordinate strings (e.g., '-123') that bypass validation and create points in unexpected positions on the curve? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g2_projective_str_to_affine] [Array length validation] The function expects exactly 2-element arrays for x and y - what happens if an attacker provides arrays of different lengths through unsafe code or FFI? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g2_projective_str_to_affine] [Fq2 consistency] For G2 points, the two field elements must form a valid Fq2 element - is there validation that the imaginary component satisfies BN254's quadratic non-residue requirement? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g1_projective_str_to_affine] [Subgroup check timing] The comment says 'this will do the proper subgroup membership checks' - is this vulnerable to timing attacks where attackers can distinguish between points in the subgroup vs. cofactor? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: g2_projective_str_to_affine] [Cofactor clearing] Does the conversion properly multiply by the cofactor to map arbitrary curve points to the prime-order subgroup, or can small-subgroup attacks succeed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Import: g1_projective_str_to_affine] [Deserialization validation] The G1Bytes::deserialize_into_affine() is called - does this perform constant-time validation, or can timing attacks reveal information about the secret setup parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Import: g2_projective_str_to_affine] [Compression validation] When deserializing compressed G2 points, is there validation that the compression flag bits are set correctly, preventing point malleability attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_AUD_VAL_BYTES] [Cross-file consistency] This constant is re-exported in IdCommitment::MAX_AUD_VAL_BYTES - if they get out of sync due to refactoring, can this cause address derivation mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_UID_KEY_BYTES] [Hash function dependency] The constant is used with poseidon_bn254::keyless::pad_and_hash_string - if the hash function changes but the constant doesn't, can this break address derivation for all existing accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_UID_VAL_BYTES] [Padding scheme vulnerability] If the Poseidon padding scheme changes but MAX_UID_VAL_BYTES stays constant, can attackers exploit the padding mismatch to create colliding identity commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [VK source validation] The VK is from 'commit 125522b4b226f8ece3e3162cecfefe915d13bc30 of keyless-circuit' - is there runtime validation that this commit hash is authentic and hasn't been tampered with? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Circuit parameter binding] The VK should be cryptographically bound to the circuit constraints - is there verification that this VK actually corresponds to the keyless JWT verification circuit? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_EXTRA_FIELD_BYTES] [Empty field hash] The EMPTY_EXTRA_FIELD_HASH uses a single space ' ' when extra_field is none - can an attacker exploit this by providing ' ' as an actual extra_field to create signature malleability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_JWT_HEADER_B64_BYTES] [Base64 decoding] The constant is for base64-encoded header - if base64 decoding has length expansion/contraction, can this cause buffer overflows when the decoded size exceeds expectations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [All constants] [Visibility control] All constants are pub(crate) - can internal code paths incorrectly modify these 'constants' via unsafe code or test frameworks, breaking production invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Static: TEST_GROTH16_SETUP] [Test isolation] If unit tests run concurrently and access TEST_GROTH16_SETUP, can race conditions cause test flakiness that masks real security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Public function] The function is pub, not pub(crate) - can external crates accidentally import and use this test VK in production code? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Function: prepared_vk_for_testing()] [Pairing implementation] The verification uses ark_groth16's pairing implementation - are there any known bugs or side-channel vulnerabilities in this library? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/circuit_constants.rs] [Constant: MAX_COMMITED_EPK_BYTES] [Poseidon hash security] The EPK commitment uses Poseidon hash - if Poseidon has collision vulnerabilities for this specific parameter set, can attackers forge EPK commitments? (High)",
