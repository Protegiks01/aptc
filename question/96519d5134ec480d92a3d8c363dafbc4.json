  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Newline Injection] If output contains CRLF injection sequences when writing to stdout (println!), can this be exploited for terminal control sequence injection or log spoofing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Error Propagation] The write() function uses '?' operator to propagate errors - are all error cases from std::fs::write() properly handled by callers, or can unexpected errors cause validator health check failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Panic Safety] Can any input to write() cause a panic (e.g., through std::fs::write() internal panics), potentially crashing the node-checker process during critical health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Error Information Leak] Do error messages from std::fs::write() expose sensitive filesystem information (like absolute paths, permissions) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Partial Write Handling] If std::fs::write() performs a partial write due to disk full or I/O errors, is this detected and handled gracefully, or can it result in corrupted output files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Command Injection] Can special characters in command-line arguments for output_path be exploited through clap's parsing to inject shell commands if the tool is invoked via scripts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Argument Parsing] Does clap properly sanitize the -o/--output_path argument, or can attackers use shell metacharacters (;, |, &, $) to manipulate the path in unsafe ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Default Value Security] The format field has default_value_t = OutputFormat::Yaml - is this default safe for all use cases, or could forcing YAML over JSON introduce parsing vulnerabilities in some contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Short Flag Collision] The -o and -f short flags could collide with other tools or scripts - can this cause unintended behavior when node-checker is integrated into larger automation systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Windows Path Handling] On Windows, can output_path use UNC paths (\\\\\\\\server\\\\share) or drive letters (C:\\\\) to write to network locations or unauthorized drives? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Windows Reserved Names] On Windows, can output_path use reserved device names (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1) causing std::fs::write() to fail or behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Case Insensitive FS] On case-insensitive filesystems (Windows, macOS default), can attackers exploit case variations in output_path to bypass allowlists or overwrite files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Path Separator] Does the code handle both forward slashes (/) and backslashes (\\\\) in output_path correctly across platforms, or can mixed separators cause path confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Stdout Buffer Overflow] When output_path is None and write() uses println!(), can extremely large output strings cause buffer overflow in stdout buffering? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Terminal Control Sequences] If output contains ANSI escape sequences when writing to stdout, can this be exploited to manipulate terminal display, hide errors, or inject malicious commands? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Stdout Redirection] If stdout is redirected to a file by the caller, does println!() behave safely, or can this introduce the same file overwrite vulnerabilities as output_path? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Pipe Handling] If stdout is piped to another process, can println!() block indefinitely if the receiving process hangs, causing node-checker to freeze? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Option<PathBuf> Safety] Is the Option<PathBuf> type for output_path properly validated after parsing, or can None values bypass intended validations in caller code? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Enum: OutputFormat] [Enum Exhaustiveness] Are all match statements on OutputFormat exhaustive? Can future additions of new enum variants introduce unhandled cases causing panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Clone Safety] The #[derive(Clone)] on OutputArgs - can cloning introduce issues if PathBuf contains references to temporary files or file handles? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Debug Safety] The #[derive(Debug)] implementation - does Debug output for PathBuf leak sensitive path information in logs that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Caller Validation] Do callers of write() (like generate_openapi.rs) validate the format parameter matches the actual output content, preventing format confusion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Struct Fields] Are the pub fields of OutputArgs directly accessible to external code, allowing bypassing any validation that should happen in the write() method? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Content Validation] Does write() assume the output parameter contains valid YAML/JSON, or should it validate the structure before writing to prevent serving malformed specs? (Low)",
