  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Impl: FunderTrait] [Missing error cases] Can FakeFunder never returning Err(AptosTapError) prevent proper testing of error handling middleware and API error responses, hiding bugs where error cases are improperly formatted or logged? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Integration: enum_dispatch] Can the enum_dispatch macro incorrectly dispatch method calls to FakeFunder when a different funder variant is expected, causing silent funding failures due to type confusion in the Funder enum? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Integration: FunderConfig] Does the FunderConfig::build() method lack safeguards to prevent FakeFunder from being built in production builds, allowing test-only code to be deployed to production blockchain nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Integration: Arc<Funder>] Can FakeFunder being wrapped in Arc cause reference counting issues or prevent proper cleanup when the funder should be replaced with a real implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Integration: serde] Does the Deserialize derive on FakeFunderConfig allow deserialization from untrusted sources without validation, potentially enabling configuration injection attacks that force FakeFunder to be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Struct: FakeFunder] [Sync/Send safety] Can FakeFunder being Sync + Send without internal synchronization cause data races if state is later added to the struct, since the trait bounds are already established? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Function: fund()] [Concurrent calls] Can concurrent calls to fund() from multiple threads cause race conditions in tests that assume sequential execution, hiding concurrency bugs in production funders that must handle concurrent requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Function: get_amount()] [Concurrent access] Does get_amount() being a synchronous function prevent testing of async-specific race conditions in amount calculation logic that might occur in production async funders? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Testing: mock behavior] Can tests relying on FakeFunder create false confidence by passing with the no-op implementation while hiding integration bugs that would fail with real funders that perform actual blockchain operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Testing: transaction validation] Does FakeFunder returning empty transactions prevent testing of transaction validation, signature verification, and sequence number handling in API endpoints and middleware? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Testing: error injection] Can the inability to configure FakeFunder to return specific errors prevent proper testing of error handling, retry logic, and circuit breaker patterns in faucet API handlers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Testing: timing behavior] Does FakeFunder completing instantly prevent testing of timeout handling, request cancellation, and rate limiting behavior that depends on actual funding operation duration? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _amount] [Boundary values] Can passing boundary values like 0, 1, u64::MAX-1, u64::MAX to the amount parameter expose off-by-one errors or overflow bugs in production code that performs arithmetic operations on amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _receiver_address] [Special addresses] Does fund() accepting special AccountAddress values like 0x0, 0x1 (framework address), or validator addresses without validation hide access control bugs that should prevent funding of privileged accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _receiver_address] [Invalid addresses] Can malformed AccountAddress values with invalid checksums or non-canonical representations pass through FakeFunder without detection, hiding address validation vulnerabilities in API parsing logic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _asset] [Asset injection] Can the _asset parameter accept SQL-like strings, path traversal sequences, or script tags without sanitization, potentially hiding injection vulnerabilities in production funders that query or log asset names? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _asset] [Asset validation bypass] Does ignoring the asset parameter prevent testing of multi-asset funding logic, potentially hiding bugs where incorrect asset types are funded or asset type confusion leads to loss of funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _check_only] [Mode confusion] Can the _check_only flag being ignored cause tests to incorrectly assume check-only mode is working, hiding bugs where production funders perform actual funding when only eligibility checks were requested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _did_bypass_checkers] [Security bypass] Does ignoring _did_bypass_checkers prevent testing of security-critical bypass logic, potentially allowing production deployments with insufficient audit logging or access control when bypass mechanisms are used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Parameter: _did_bypass_checkers] [Privilege escalation] Can attackers manipulate bypass flags in production if FakeFunder's lack of bypass validation hides bugs in production funders that should strictly enforce bypass authentication and authorization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Return: Vec<SignedTransaction>] [Empty vector semantics] Can downstream code incorrectly interpret an empty transaction vector as a funding failure rather than a no-op, causing incorrect API responses or retry loops? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Return: Vec<SignedTransaction>] [Transaction ordering] Does returning an empty vector prevent testing of transaction ordering requirements, potentially hiding bugs where production funders return transactions in incorrect order causing sequence number errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Return: Result<Vec<SignedTransaction>>] [Error variant absence] Can the absence of Err variants in FakeFunder's return values hide error handling bugs in match statements or error propagation chains that assume certain error types can occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Return: u64] [Numeric range] Can get_amount() returning values outside expected ranges (e.g., larger than faucet balance) hide bounds checking bugs in production code that should validate funding amounts against available balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/funder/fake.rs] [Side effects: none] [Idempotency testing] Does FakeFunder having no side effects prevent testing of idempotency requirements, potentially hiding bugs where duplicate funding requests incorrectly transfer funds multiple times?
