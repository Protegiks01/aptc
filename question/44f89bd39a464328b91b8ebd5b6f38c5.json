  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.version] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker manipulate the version field (i64) to cause integer overflow when converting to/from u64 transaction versions used internally, potentially allowing replay attacks or state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.version] [Negative value injection] Since version is i64 (signed), can negative version numbers be injected into BigQuery, breaking ordering assumptions and allowing transactions to be queried/displayed out of sequence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.version] [Replay attack] Is the version field validated against the actual blockchain state before insertion, or can an attacker inject duplicate version numbers to create false transaction records in BigQuery for fraudulent analytics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.version] [Type mismatch] Does the i64 version field properly handle the u64 version numbers from Aptos blockchain without truncation or sign extension bugs that could cause version collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.version] [Monotonicity violation] Can out-of-order version insertions occur due to race conditions in the streaming pipeline, breaking the monotonic version guarantee and allowing historical transaction tampering?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.block_height] [Fork detection bypass] Is there validation that block_height is consistent with version number, or can an attacker inject mismatched block_height/version pairs to hide fork events in analytics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.block_height] [Integer overflow] Can block_height overflow when converting from internal u64 representation, causing blocks to appear earlier than they actually occurred and breaking temporal analysis?

  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.hash] [Hash collision injection] Since hash is an unvalidated string field, can an attacker inject duplicate or malformed transaction hashes to create false positive matches in BigQuery queries used for fraud detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.hash] [Hash format manipulation] Is the hash string validated to be a valid hex-encoded transaction hash, or can arbitrary strings be injected to cause SQL injection-like attacks in BigQuery queries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.hash] [Case sensitivity bypass] Are hash comparisons case-sensitive in BigQuery queries, or can an attacker inject hashes with different casing to evade detection while maintaining uniqueness constraints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.hash] [Hash length violation] Can truncated or extended hash strings be inserted, breaking downstream systems that assume fixed-length transaction identifiers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.hash] [Special character injection] Can the hash field contain special characters, Unicode, or null bytes that break BigQuery parsing or cause query injection vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/protos/rust/src/pb/aptos.bigquery_schema.transaction.v1.rs] [Field: Transaction.type] [Type enumeration bypass] Since type is stored as an unrestricted string, can attackers inject invalid transaction types not recognized by Aptos to bypass analytics filters or cause parsing errors?
