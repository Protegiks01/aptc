  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Empty Set Handling] When reads or writes are empty HashSets, does conflict detection properly handle these edge cases, or can transactions with no reads bypass all conflict checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Reflexive Conflicts] Can a transaction conflict with itself if the same ReadWriteSummary is compared, and would this cause execution deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Serializability Violation] Can the parallel execution scheduler using ReadWriteSummary produce results that violate serializability guarantees, allowing states that couldn't occur in sequential execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Cascading Aborts] When a transaction aborts due to conflicts, are all dependent transactions also properly aborted, or can partial results persist causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Re-execution Consistency] When transactions are re-executed after conflict detection, are the read/write sets guaranteed to be identical, or can non-deterministic behavior cause different conflict detection results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Priority Inversion] Can low-priority transactions block high-priority transactions through false positive conflicts, enabling transaction censorship or griefing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: Group(K, T)] [Tag Manipulation] Can attackers manipulate the Tag type parameter to create artificial conflicts or hide real conflicts between resource group accesses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: Group(K, T)] [Cross-Group Conflicts] Does conflict detection properly handle conflicts between Group(k1, t1) and Resource(k2) where k1 and k2 might refer to related resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: Group(K, T)] [Tag Collision] Can different tag values hash to the same value in the HashSet, causing unrelated resource group accesses to spuriously conflict? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: DelayedField(DelayedFieldID)] [ID Generation] Can attackers predict or manipulate DelayedFieldID values to create conflicts with other transactions or hide their own delayed field accesses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: DelayedField(DelayedFieldID)] [Resolution Timing] Are delayed fields properly synchronized with normal resource accesses, or can delayed field resolution happen at wrong times causing state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: DelayedField(DelayedFieldID)] [ID Exhaustion] Can the DelayedFieldID space be exhausted by malicious actors creating unlimited delayed fields, preventing legitimate delayed field operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum Variant: DelayedField(DelayedFieldID)] [Cross-Type Conflicts] Does the conflict detection properly isolate DelayedField accesses from Resource/Group accesses, or can they interfere in unexpected ways? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Clone Safety] If ReadWriteSummary is cloned, are the HashSets properly deep-copied, or can shallow copies cause use-after-free bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Drop Behavior] Does ReadWriteSummary have a custom Drop implementation, and if so, can it panic or cause double-free issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Send/Sync Safety] Is ReadWriteSummary properly Send/Sync for cross-thread usage in parallel execution, or can data races occur? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Struct: ReadWriteSummary] [Lifetime Soundness] Are all references in ReadWriteSummary methods lifetime-safe, or can they create dangling pointers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Generic: T::Key] [Key Collision] Can malicious implementations of the Transaction::Key type create keys that collide in HashSet, bypassing conflict detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Generic: T::Tag] [Tag Forgery] Can attackers forge Tag values to access resource groups they shouldn't have access to, bypassing Move's type safety? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [Empty Sets] When both transactions have empty read/write sets, does conflicts_with_previous() correctly return false, or can empty set handling cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
