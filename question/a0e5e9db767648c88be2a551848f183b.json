  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unlock_stake()] [Concurrent Unlocks] If multiple unlock_stake transactions are submitted concurrently with the same sequence number, can this create race conditions leading to unlocking more than the actual stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unlock_stake()] [None Amount] At line 397, if amount is None, does it unlock all stake? If so, can this be exploited to force-unlock validator stakes, affecting network security? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: distribute_staking_rewards()] [Reward Calculation] At lines 431-468, is the reward distribution amount calculated correctly, or can rounding errors accumulate to allow draining the reward pool or shortchanging delegators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: distribute_staking_rewards()] [Authorization Check] At lines 435-436, is there validation that only the authorized party (operator or staker) can trigger reward distribution, or can anyone distribute rewards causing unexpected state changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: distribute_staking_rewards()] [Multiple Distribution] Can rewards be distributed multiple times for the same epoch, allowing reward double-claiming and draining the reward pool? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Minimum Stake] At line 476, is there validation of minimum stake_amount required to create a pool, or can attackers create numerous pools with tiny amounts to bloat state and cause DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Commission Validation] At line 477, if commission_percentage exceeds 100, can this allow the operator to extract more than the actual rewards, draining delegator funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Duplicate Pool] Is there validation preventing creation of multiple stake pools by the same owner, which could be used to circumvent per-pool limits or confuse delegators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Operator/Voter Validation] At lines 474-475, if new_operator or new_voter are None, does the pool become unmanageable, permanently locking funds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Parse Not Same] At line 510, parse_not_same is always true. Does this skip critical validation checks that could allow malformed pool creation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: add_delegated_stake()] [Pool Validation] At line 519, is there validation that pool_address is a valid and active staking pool, or can delegators lose funds by staking to non-existent or malicious pools? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: add_delegated_stake()] [Amount Validation] At line 520, if amount is None, does it stake all available balance? Can this be exploited in phishing attacks to drain user accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: add_delegated_stake()] [Stake Accounting] When adding delegated stake, is the delegator's share calculated correctly, or can rounding errors allow operators to claim more than their fair share of rewards? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unlock_delegated_stake()] [Unlock Validation] At lines 555-592, can a delegator unlock more stake than they actually delegated through integer overflow or incorrect amount handling? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: unlock_delegated_stake()] [Lockup Period] Is the lockup period properly enforced, or can delegators bypass it by unlocking immediately after delegation, undermining staking security? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: metadata_for_ops()] [Sequence Number Omission] At line 743, if sequence_number is None, the server determines it. Can this lead to race conditions where two clients generate the same sequence number? (High)",
