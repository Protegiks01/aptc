  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Metric Collection Failure] If RESPONSE_STATUS or HISTOGRAM metric collection fails at lines 128-139, does the Drop impl continue to log, or does it abort and lose audit trail data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Histogram Bucket DoS] Can an attacker send requests with precise timing to hit expensive histogram bucket calculations at line 139, causing CPU exhaustion in metric collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Label String Allocation] Does the to_string() conversion of response_status at lines 129, 137 allocate new strings for every request, potentially causing memory fragmentation under high load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Metric Label Validation] Are the metric labels (method, operation_id, status) at lines 134-137 validated against Prometheus label naming rules, or can invalid labels cause metric scraping failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Drop Order Dependency] If DropLogger depends on other resources (metrics collectors, loggers) being available during drop, can out-of-order shutdown cause the Drop impl to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Nested Drop Panic] If any of the logging operations at lines 128-157 panic, does the Drop panic handler prevent proper cleanup of other resources, causing cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Drop in Destructor Context] Is the Drop implementation at lines 118-159 safe to call in all destructor contexts (thread exit, panic unwinding, etc.), or can it cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Request Body Consumption] Does the RequestBody::default() at line 25 properly handle request body consumption, or can it interfere with the actual request processing at line 50? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Response Mutation] Can modifying the response at line 50-65 accidentally corrupt response data or drop important headers/body content needed by downstream middleware? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Result Propagation] Does the Ok(response) return at line 65 properly propagate all error conditions, or can some errors be swallowed by the logging middleware? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: DropLogger] [Ownership Transfer] When DropLogger takes ownership of HttpRequestLog at line 108, can the original request data still be accessed elsewhere causing potential use-after-move bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: DropLogger] [Option Handling] Does the Option<HttpResponseLog> at line 102 properly handle the None case in all code paths, or can unwrapping cause panics if attach_response_log is never called? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Struct: HttpResponseLog] [Borrow Lifetime] Can the &'a str lifetime for operation_id at line 84 outlive the response data, causing dangling references if response is dropped early? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Faucet Request Tracking] Can the logging miss critical faucet-specific information like requested amounts, recipient addresses, or transaction hashes, making fraud detection impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Rate Limit Bypass Detection] Does the logging capture enough information to detect rate limit bypass attempts through IP rotation, multiple user agents, or proxy chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Trait: Drop] [Faucet Abuse Monitoring] Can the different log levels (info/error/warn) at lines 142-157 be exploited to hide faucet abuse patterns that would be caught by anomaly detection on error logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Transaction Correlation] Can the lack of transaction IDs or correlation IDs in the logging make it impossible to trace faucet fund disbursements back to specific requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Middleware Ordering] Can incorrect middleware ordering cause the log middleware to run before authentication/authorization, logging unauthenticated requests and wasting resources? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/middleware/log.rs] [Function: middleware_log()] [Error Middleware Interaction] If error handling middleware runs after this logger, can errors be double-logged or mis-categorized, confusing monitoring systems? (Low)",
