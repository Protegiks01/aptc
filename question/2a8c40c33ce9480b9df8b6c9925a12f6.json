  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: handle_dump_block_request()] [Debug Format Exposure] Does logging 'block_id' with {:?} at line 101 expose the full HashValue structure in logs, potentially revealing hash algorithm internals or implementation details? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: handle_dump_quorum_store_db_request()] [Error Logging Detail] Can the error log at line 65 include sensitive information from the error chain that should be redacted before logging, such as database paths or validator keys? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: handle_dump_consensus_db_request()] [Log Injection] Can error.to_string() at line 31 contain newlines or special characters that enable log injection attacks where attackers inject fake log entries to hide their activities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_blocks_bcs()] [Non-Deterministic Replay] If the blocks iterator at line 227 doesn't guarantee deterministic ordering across database snapshots, can replaying the BCS-encoded transactions produce different state roots causing consensus disagreement? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_blocks()] [Missing Metadata for Replay] Does the transaction dump include all necessary metadata (gas prices, timestamps, sequence numbers) required for accurate replay, or can missing data cause replay to produce incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_consensus_db()] [Incomplete Consensus State] Can dumping only last_vote and highest_tc at lines 133-134 miss other critical consensus state like pending proposals or buffered votes, making the dump insufficient for full consensus recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_blocks_bcs()] [Transaction Signature Verification] Does the Transaction::UserTransaction wrapper at line 232 preserve original signatures, or can signature data be lost during serialization preventing audit verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: handle_dump_block_request()] [None vs Empty Distinction] Can the block_id: Option<HashValue> at line 82 case where None is explicitly passed differ in behavior from omitting the parameter, potentially causing unexpected database queries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_blocks()] [Genesis Block Edge Case] Does the block iteration at line 190 properly handle the genesis block which may have special properties like no parent_id, or can it cause crashes when dumping genesis epoch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_quorum_store_db()] [Empty Batch Handling] Can get_batch() at line 168 return an empty batch, and does the code properly handle this case or does it crash when trying to format an empty batch at line 167?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_consensus_db()] [Epoch Boundary Corruption] Can calling get_data() at line 134 during an epoch transition return data from mixed epochs, causing exported consensus state to be internally inconsistent and violate epoch boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_consensus_db()] [Safety Rule Violation] Does exposing last_vote allow attackers to determine if a validator is about to violate safety rules by voting at a lower round than previously voted, enabling them to amplify the impact by broadcasting the violation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/consensus/mod.rs] [Function: dump_blocks()] [Forked Chain Exposure] Can the blocks iterator at line 190 return blocks from multiple competing forks, and does the code distinguish which fork is canonical, or can this expose internal fork-choice state?
