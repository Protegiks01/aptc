  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Unit key collision] Since KeyPairSchema uses () as the key, can only one key pair exist at a time, and what happens if validators need to maintain multiple epoch key pairs during epoch transitions - could this cause key loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Pop operation safety] Why does get_key_pair_bytes() use pop() on the result vector - could this return incorrect key pairs if multiple entries exist, and is there validation that only one entry should exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Identifier uniqueness] Does save_aug_data() using aug_data.id() as the key guarantee uniqueness per (epoch, author) pair, or could hash collisions in AugDataId allow different augmented data to be stored under the same key? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Certification downgrade] Can save_certified_aug_data() overwrite existing certified data with newly received certified data that has fewer signatures, potentially allowing Byzantine validators to downgrade quorum certificates? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: get_all_aug_data()] [Type safety] With generic type parameter D: TAugmentedData, could deserialization of AugData<D> fail if the stored data was serialized with a different concrete type, causing validators to crash when loading storage? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [ID mapping safety] Does remove_aug_data() correctly map Vec<AugData<D>> to their IDs using d.id(), and could this mapping fail for cloned or modified data causing deletion of wrong entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Cleanup timing] Is there a defined cleanup policy for when remove_certified_aug_data() should be called, or could premature cleanup delete certified data needed for late-joining validators to catch up? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Struct: RandDb] [Arc sharing safety] Is the Arc<DB> properly shared across threads without data races, and could concurrent access patterns in consensus cause deadlocks or performance issues in the underlying SchemaDB? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/db.rs] [Struct: RandDb] [Database corruption recovery] If the underlying RocksDB becomes corrupted, does RandDb have recovery mechanisms, or would validators need to resync from genesis losing all randomness generation state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemRandDb] [Concurrent access safety] Are the RwLock<HashMap> data structures properly synchronized for concurrent read/write access, or could race conditions during consensus rounds cause validators to read stale augmented data? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Lock poisoning] If save_key_pair_bytes() panics while holding the write lock, would the RwLock become poisoned making all future randomness operations fail and halting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_key_pair_bytes()] [Replace semantics] Does key_pair.write().replace() properly handle the Option<(u64, Vec<u8>)> ensuring old epoch keys are replaced atomically, or could interleaving operations cause temporary states with no key pair? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [HashMap collision] When insert() is called with the same AugDataId, does it overwrite existing data, and could Byzantine validators exploit this to repeatedly overwrite legitimate augmented data from honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_aug_data()] [Clone overhead] Does cloning aug_data.clone() for every save operation create performance issues or memory pressure during high-throughput randomness generation? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: save_certified_aug_data()] [Memory exhaustion] Since InMemRandDb stores all data in memory, can Byzantine validators flood it with thousands of certified augmented data entries causing memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Read lock contention] Could long-held read locks during get_key_pair_bytes() block writers trying to update key pairs during epoch transitions, causing consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_key_pair_bytes()] [Clone cost] Does cloning the entire Option<(u64, Vec<u8>)> including potentially large key pair bytes create performance issues when called frequently? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_all_aug_data()] [Snapshot consistency] When get_all_aug_data() clones the entire HashMap and converts to Vec, is this snapshot consistent, or could concurrent modifications during iteration cause some entries to be duplicated or missing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: get_all_certified_aug_data()] [Large data copy] Does converting the entire certified_aug_data HashMap to Vec cause memory spikes that could exhaust available memory during periods of many active validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Partial removal] If remove() fails for some entries in the Vec<AugData<D>>, does remove_aug_data() continue with remaining entries or fail completely, and could partial removal cause state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: remove_aug_data()] [Lock duration] Does iterating through aug_data vector and removing each entry while holding write lock for extended periods block all other storage operations causing consensus delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Function: remove_certified_aug_data()] [Deletion verification] Is there verification that all entries in Vec<CertifiedAugData<D>> actually existed before removal, or could calling code accidentally pass wrong data causing silent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemRandDb] [Restart persistence] Since InMemRandDb stores everything in memory, is there a risk that using it in production would cause all randomness state to be lost on validator restarts, breaking epoch continuity? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/in_memory.rs] [Struct: InMemRandDb] [Test vs production] Is InMemRandDb properly isolated to test environments only, or could configuration errors cause production validators to use in-memory storage losing critical randomness data? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/storage/schema.rs] [Schema: KeyPairSchema] [Key collision] Since KeyPairSchema uses () as the key type, can only one key pair exist per database, and could this cause issues during epoch transitions when multiple epochs' key pairs should coexist temporarily?
