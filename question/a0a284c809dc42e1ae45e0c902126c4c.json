  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_address()] [Cloud metadata service] If faucet runs in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure) and binds to 0.0.0.0, can attackers access cloud metadata services through SSRF by sending requests to the faucet that get proxied to 169.254.169.254? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Function: default_listen_port()] [Firewall bypass] Can the predictable default port 10212 be used to bypass firewall rules that only block common ports, allowing attackers to access the faucet when they shouldn't be able to? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No request size limits] ServerConfig lacks fields for maximum request body size - can this lead to unbounded request processing that exhausts memory when attackers send gigabyte-sized requests? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No timeout configuration] There are no fields for read/write/idle timeouts - can this allow slowloris-style attacks where attackers hold connections open indefinitely, exhausting server resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-faucet/core/src/server/server_args.rs] [Struct: ServerConfig] [No connection limits] ServerConfig doesn't specify maximum concurrent connections - can this allow attackers to exhaust file descriptors by opening thousands of simultaneous connections? (Medium)"
