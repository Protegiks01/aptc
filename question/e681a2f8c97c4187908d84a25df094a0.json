  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker provide extremely large values for n and t parameters such that the computation n - t at line 51 causes integer underflow when t > n is not caught early enough, bypassing the check at line 47-49 and leading to incorrect polynomial degree calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Boundary condition] If includes_zero is true and batch_dom.size() equals exactly n-1 (line 38-45), can edge cases in subsequent FFT operations cause out-of-bounds access when the domain is used for n-element computations, potentially causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Logic error] The validation at line 51 checks f.len() != n - t, but can an attacker exploit the case where n and t are chosen such that n - t overflows or becomes zero, allowing malformed polynomial coefficients to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Edge case] When t == n (line 59-61), the code expects an empty polynomial f, but does this create a degenerate case where the low-degree test always passes regardless of input evaluations, potentially allowing invalid polynomial commitments in DKG protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Validation bypass] The check at line 38-45 validates batch_dom.size() < min_size, but can an attacker provide a batch_dom with size() that is a power of 2 but still too small to handle edge cases in FFT computation, causing silent corruption of dual code word calculations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [State inconsistency] If the polynomial f contains all-zero coefficients (except potentially the constant term), does the validation properly detect this degenerate case, or can it lead to dual code words that incorrectly validate high-degree polynomials? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Parameter confusion] When includes_zero is true, the validation computes min_size = n - 1 (line 38), but the polynomial f has length n - t.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Type confusion] The batch_dom parameter has a lifetime 'a tied to the LowDegreeTest struct, but can unsafe lifetime extension or concurrent modification of the underlying domain cause use-after-free or data races in subsequent FFT operations?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [RNG state exhaustion] If sample_field_elements is called with a very large n - t value, can it exhaust the RNG's entropy pool or cause the sampling to produce biased field elements, weakening the cryptographic security of the low-degree test? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [Unwrap panic] Line 87 uses .unwrap() on the result of new().

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [Parameter injection] Can a malicious caller provide invalid t, n, or includes_zero parameters that pass through to new() and cause the unwrap() at line 87 to panic, allowing targeted DoS attacks on specific validators during DKG ceremonies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [Deterministic RNG] If the RNG is accidentally seeded with the same value across multiple validators, will all validators generate identical dual code word polynomials f, and does this break the security guarantees of the SCRAPE protocol?
