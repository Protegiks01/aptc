(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Status Code Confusion] When returning INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR at lines 23-26 and 32-35, does the error message body leak enough information to allow attackers to distinguish between different failure modes and map internal service architecture? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Missing Request Validation] The function accepts _req: Request<Body> at line 13 but never validates the request body, query parameters, or headers - can malformed requests cause parsing errors or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [HTTP Method Bypass] Does the parent router in server/mod.rs ensure only GET requests reach this handler, or can attackers use POST/PUT/DELETE methods to potentially trigger unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Slow Loris Attack] Can an attacker send requests that cause receiver.await to block for extended periods, tying up HTTP worker threads and preventing legitimate admin requests from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Request Amplification] If each GetAddressesFromParkingLot request causes expensive operations in the mempool (lock acquisition, index iteration), can attackers use this endpoint to amplify their impact on validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Memory Leak] If bcs::to_bytes at line 19 succeeds but reply_with fails to send the response, are the serialized bytes properly deallocated, or can repeated failures cause memory accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker create millions of oneshot channels by sending rapid concurrent requests, exhausting file descriptors or memory on the validator node? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Data Tampering] Between when get_parking_lot_addresses returns Ok(addresses) at line 16 and when bcs::to_bytes serializes them at line 19, can any concurrent operations modify the Vec<(AccountAddress, u64)> causing data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Type Confusion] The function returns Result<Vec<(AccountAddress, u64)>, Canceled> at line 42, but if mempool sends malformed data through the oneshot channel, can type confusion cause deserialization errors or memory corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [BCS Version Mismatch] If the BCS serialization version changes between releases, can clients receiving responses from bcs::to_bytes at line 19 fail to deserialize, causing client crashes or incorrect behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: mempool_handle_parking_lot_address_request()] [Timing Side-Channel] Can an attacker measure response times to infer parking lot size, and use this to determine when specific accounts submit transactions with sequence number gaps, leaking transaction submission patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Response Time Correlation] Does the time between try_send at line 45-47 and receiver.await at line 49 correlate with mempool load, allowing attackers to infer when validators are under stress and time attacks accordingly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Clone Cost] At line 46, mempool_client_sender.clone() is called on every request - if MempoolClientSender contains Arc references, is the clone cost acceptable, or can high request rates cause performance degradation?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-admin-service/src/server/mempool/mod.rs] [Function: get_parking_lot_addresses()] [Excessive Logging] At line 51, info! logs every try_send failure - can an attacker trigger log flooding by causing repeated send failures, filling disk space and causing operational issues?
