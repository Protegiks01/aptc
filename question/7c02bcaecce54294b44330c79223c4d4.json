  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Unicode normalization] Do old_value and new_value undergo Unicode normalization, or can attackers create 'mutations' using visually identical but differently encoded strings (e.g., NFC vs NFD) to fake changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Whitespace handling] Can leading/trailing whitespace in String fields cause comparison failures when validating mutation consistency, or be exploited to create visually identical but different values? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Event emission] [Rate limiting] Is there any rate limiting on CollectionMutation event emission per collection, or can attackers spam mutations to exhaust indexer resources and increase query latency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Storage] [Event pruning] Do full nodes and indexers prune old CollectionMutation events, or does unbounded historical event retention eventually exhaust disk storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Fuzz testing] Has try_from_bytes() been thoroughly fuzz tested with malformed BCS inputs to ensure it cannot crash, panic, or exhibit undefined behavior on adversarial inputs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Struct: CollectionMutation] [Round-trip testing] Is there testing verifying that serialize(deserialize(x)) == x for all valid CollectionMutation instances, ensuring no data loss during encoding round trips? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Multi-sig mutations] [Event authenticity] When collection mutations are performed by multi-sig accounts, do events properly attribute mutations to the multi-sig authority, or can individual signers claim sole authorship? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Collection deletion] [Orphaned events] If a collection is deleted, do its CollectionMutation events remain queryable, or are they orphaned causing indexer errors when trying to resolve collection references? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_mutation.rs] [Integration: Cross-module events] [Module verification] Can other Move modules emit events with type_tag matching COLLECTION_MUTATION_TYPE but containing different data, bypassing collection module invariants? (Critical)"
