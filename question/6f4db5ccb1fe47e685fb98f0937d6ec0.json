  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: add_aug_data()] [Single signature insufficient] AugDataSignature is a single signature not aggregate - can a single Byzantine validator self-certify their augmented data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore] [Config validator set mismatch] If config.validator contains different validators than the actual validator set, can unauthorized parties submit augmented data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: new()] [Fast config inconsistency] If fast_config has different validator sets or weights than config, can this cause Byzantine validators to get different power in fast vs slow path? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore] [Signer config mismatch] If signer's author is not in config.validator set, what happens? Can unauthorized signers create valid signatures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore] [Arc reference counting] Multiple Arc fields (signer, db) - can circular references or incorrect Arc handling cause memory leaks accumulating over epochs? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore<D>] [TAugmentedData trait bounds] TAugmentedData requires Send + Sync but augment() modifies RandConfig which may not be thread-safe - can concurrent augment calls cause data races? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: new()] [Generic type lifetime] Does the TAugmentedData generic properly constrain lifetimes to prevent use-after-free when database returns references? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Struct: AugDataStore] [Version mismatch] No version field in AugDataStore - can mixing old/new validators during upgrades cause incompatible augmented data formats? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: add_aug_data()] [No metrics] No instrumentation for equivocation detection - can Byzantine validators probe for equivocation tolerance without being detected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/aug_data_store.rs] [Function: add_aug_data()] [Order dependency] HashMap insertion order affects iteration - can Byzantine validators exploit insertion timing to influence which data is processed first? (Medium)",
