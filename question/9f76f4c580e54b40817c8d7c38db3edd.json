  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Missing Context] [Root Cause Loss] Does converting specific errors to generic InternalError or SerializationError lose critical context needed for forensic analysis after a security incident, making it impossible to determine the attack vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Missing Context] [Transaction Tracing] Are transaction IDs, block heights, or shard IDs preserved when errors are created, enabling proper correlation of errors with specific execution contexts for security auditing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Missing Context] [Stack Traces] Does the error enum preserve stack traces or error chains that would help identify whether errors originate from malicious inputs vs. legitimate failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Missing Context] [Error Codes] Are there unique error codes or identifiers that enable automated monitoring and alerting for specific security-relevant error conditions in the executor service? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Module: error] [Dead Code] Since the error module is marked with #[allow(dead_code)], does this mean error handling is not properly implemented in the executor service, potentially allowing failures to be silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Module: error] [Incomplete Implementation] If the Error enum is not actively used, are there alternative error handling mechanisms that might be inconsistent or less secure than the centralized error types defined here? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Module: error] [Future Use] If this error module is intended for future use, could there be incorrect assumptions about error handling in the current codebase that would cause security issues when the error types are eventually integrated? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pattern: Error Wrapping] [Error Swallowing] When errors are converted using From trait implementations, can important error context or severity information be lost, making it impossible to distinguish critical security failures from benign errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pattern: String Formatting] [Injection Attack] If error strings are constructed from user input or transaction data, could format string injection or other string manipulation attacks be possible when errors are logged or displayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pattern: Generic Errors] [Error Conflation] Can different categories of errors (network failures, authentication failures, validation failures, execution failures) all map to InternalError, making it impossible to implement appropriate security responses? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pattern: Error Propagation] [Cross-Layer Leakage] When low-level errors from BCS or networking are converted to high-level executor service errors, can this cross-layer error propagation leak abstraction violations that reveal internal implementation details? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Shared State] If Error instances are shared between threads in the ShardedExecutorService, could there be data races in the String fields despite the Rust borrow checker, especially if unsafe code is involved elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Error Accumulation] In parallel block execution, can concurrent errors from multiple transactions or shards accumulate in unexpected ways, causing memory pressure or making error analysis difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Concurrency] [Atomic Error State] When multiple threads detect different errors simultaneously, is there proper synchronization to ensure only one authoritative error is reported, or could race conditions cause error confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pipeline: Pre-Execution] [Validation Bypass] Can SerializationError during ExecuteBlockCommand deserialization be exploited to bypass transaction validation, causing invalid transactions to be processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pipeline: Execution] [Partial Execution] If InternalError occurs mid-execution after some transactions have been processed, is there proper rollback to maintain atomicity, or can partial state changes corrupt the blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pipeline: Post-Execution] [Commitment Failure] If RemoteExecutionResult serialization fails with SerializationError after successful execution, can this cause transactions to be executed but not committed, leading to state inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-service/src/error.rs] [Pipeline: Error Recovery] [Retry Logic] Does the executor service properly distinguish between recoverable errors (e.g., temporary network issues) and non-recoverable errors (e.g., invalid transactions) when using InternalError? (High)"
