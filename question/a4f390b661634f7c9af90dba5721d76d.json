  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Input validation] Can an attacker provide a malicious package name containing path traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../malicious') that later gets unsafely used in write_to_disk(), allowing arbitrary filesystem writes outside the intended directory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [TOML injection] Does the name parameter validation prevent TOML injection attacks where special characters like newlines, quotes, or brackets could corrupt the Move.toml structure when serialized in write_to_disk()? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an unbounded or extremely long package name string that causes memory exhaustion or buffer overflow when repeatedly cloned throughout the builder lifecycle? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Unicode normalization] Does the name handling properly normalize Unicode characters to prevent homograph attacks where visually similar package names (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' vs Latin 'a') could bypass package identification checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_policy()] [Policy bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the UpgradePolicy to use an overly permissive policy (e.g., arbitrary upgrades) that later allows malicious code deployment bypassing compatibility checks during on-chain package upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_policy()] [State inconsistency] Does the with_policy() builder pattern properly handle cases where policy is set multiple times, or could repeated calls create inconsistent state that gets serialized incorrectly in Move.toml? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: with_policy()] [Policy deserialization] When the policy is written to Move.toml using format!(), does the UpgradePolicy Display trait implementation prevent injection of malicious TOML directives through crafted policy strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Path traversal] Can an attacker provide a malicious path parameter containing '../../../' sequences that escape the intended package directory structure and point to arbitrary filesystem locations containing malicious Move code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Symlink attack] Does add_local_dep() validate that the path parameter is not a symbolic link pointing to sensitive system files or malicious packages, which could be included during compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Dependency substitution] Can an attacker exploit the lack of cryptographic verification in local dependencies to substitute legitimate packages with malicious ones by manipulating the filesystem before compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [TOML injection in name] Does the name parameter undergo sanitization to prevent TOML injection where special characters (newlines, quotes) could corrupt the [dependencies] section in the generated Move.toml file? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Duplicate dependency names] If add_local_dep() is called multiple times with the same name but different paths, does the Vec storage allow duplicate entries that create ambiguous dependency resolution during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Absolute vs relative paths] Does the implementation distinguish between absolute and relative paths, and could mixing them cause different resolution behavior on different systems leading to supply chain attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Windows path injection] On Windows systems, can attacker use UNC paths (\\\\\\\\server\\\\share) or drive letters in the path parameter to access network shares or arbitrary drives during package compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_local_dep()] [Empty string handling] Does add_local_dep() validate against empty strings for name or path parameters, which could create malformed TOML entries that crash the Move compiler or cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_alias()] [Address injection] Can an attacker provide a malicious addr parameter that injects TOML directives or newlines to corrupt the [addresses] section, potentially overriding critical system addresses like 0x1 (framework)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_alias()] [Address format validation] Does add_alias() validate that addr follows the proper hex format (0x[0-9a-fA-F]+), or can arbitrary strings be injected that break address resolution during Move compilation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/package-builder/src/lib.rs] [Function: add_alias()] [Namespace collision] Can an attacker add aliases that shadow critical framework addresses (e.g., aliasing 'std' to a malicious address), causing legitimate Move code to unknowingly import attacker-controlled modules?
