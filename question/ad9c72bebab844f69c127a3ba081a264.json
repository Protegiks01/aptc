  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Struct: SecretSharingConfig] [Field: validator] [Lifetime issues] Uses Arc<ValidatorVerifier> - can the verifier be updated externally while config holds old reference? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Struct: SecretSharingConfig] [Field: digest_key] [Key exposure] Is digest_key properly protected from being cloned and leaked to Byzantine validators? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::new()] [Parameter validation] No validation of input parameters - can Byzantine configs with zero threshold or invalid keys be created? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::get_id()] [Index lookup] The expect() assumes peer is in validator index - can validator set changes cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::get_id()] [Type conversion] Returns usize from validator index - can extremely large validator sets cause truncation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::threshold()] [Type conversion] Casts config.t as u64 - can negative or overflow values in underlying config cause incorrect thresholds? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::threshold()] [Value validation] No validation that threshold is reasonable (e.g., > n/2) - can Byzantine configs set threshold = 1? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/types.rs] [Function: SecretSharingConfig::get_peer_weight()] [Weight validation] Constant weight ignores actual validator stake - does this violate economic security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/] [Module interaction] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to add_share() and get_self_share() on SecretShareStore cause inconsistent reads? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/] [Module interaction] [Channel ordering] Do unbounded channels between SecretShareStore and SecretShareManager guarantee FIFO ordering for aggregated keys? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/] [Module interaction] [Lock ordering] Multiple locks are used (store.lock(), item.lock()) - can lock ordering issues cause deadlocks? (High)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/secret_share_store.rs] [Function: SecretShareAggregator::try_aggregate()] [Cryptographic aggregation] Does SecretShare::aggregate() validate that all shares are from distinct parties, or can Byzantine validators submit multiple shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/secret_share_store.rs] [Function: SecretShareAggregator::try_aggregate()] [Threshold security] If exactly threshold shares are provided, is the aggregated key secure, or does it require threshold+1 for safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/secret_sharing/network_messages.rs] [Function: SecretShareMessage::verify()] [Signature verification] Does verify() check share signatures against current validator set, or can shares from removed validators pass? (Critical)"
