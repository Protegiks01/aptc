  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: output_directory] [Path Validation] At line 97, output_directory is assigned without validation - can this be set to an empty string, '/', or other special paths causing unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: compile_relative_to_output_dir] [Path Confusion] If compile_relative_to_output_dir is true (line 102-104), how does this interact with path traversal attacks in output_directory? Could this combination allow writing to unintended locations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: include_dep_diagrams] [Resource Exhaustion] If include_dep_diagrams is enabled, could a Move package with circular dependencies or extremely complex dependency graphs cause infinite loops or memory exhaustion during diagram generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: include_call_diagrams] [Resource Exhaustion] If include_call_diagrams is enabled, could a Move package with deeply recursive function calls cause stack overflow or excessive memory usage when generating call graphs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Type Confusion] At line 112, PathBuf::from(&file) converts a string to path - if 'file' contains null bytes or invalid UTF-8, could this cause undefined behavior or path injection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Memory Safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or FFI calls in the dependencies (move_docgen::Docgen, move_package::BuildConfig) that could introduce memory corruption vulnerabilities when called from this function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] If multiple instances of docgen run concurrently with the same output_directory, could they interfere with each other's file writes, causing corrupted documentation or lost files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Race Condition] Between lines 113-114, is there protection against another process modifying or deleting the parent directory after create_dir_all() but before write()? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Information Disclosure] At line 115, the full file path is printed with println! - could this leak sensitive directory structure information to logs that might be accessible to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Information Disclosure] At line 123, 'Documentation generation successful!' is printed even if model.has_errors() is true earlier - does this give false confidence that documentation is correct when it may contain errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: references_file] [Injection Attack] At line 100, references_file content is added to each generated markdown doc - if this file contains malicious markdown (XSS payloads, script tags), will it be sanitized or injected directly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Field: template] [Supply Chain Attack] If template files are fetched from external sources or untrusted locations, could malicious templates inject backdoors into generated documentation that later gets published? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Configuration Bypass] At line 64, all_files_as_targets is hardcoded to false and target_filter is None - could an attacker bypass intended restrictions by manipulating the package structure to force documentation of internal-only modules? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Injection Attack] At line 109-116, the generator.gen() output is written directly without validation - if move_docgen::Docgen has vulnerabilities that return malicious file paths or content, will this code propagate them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Configuration Tampering] Is the BuildConfig parameter passed to execute() properly validated before use? Could a malicious caller provide a BuildConfig that alters compilation behavior to generate misleading documentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Error Handling] The function returns anyhow::Result<()> - are all error cases properly propagated with ? operator, or are some errors silently swallowed that could hide security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Panic Safety] Lines 76, 91 use if let Some(...) with unwrap() - while logically safe due to the is_some() check, could this pattern be a source of future bugs if code is refactored without updating both checks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Configuration Issue] At line 70, DocgenOptions::default() is used - are the default values secure and appropriate, or could default settings leak sensitive information or allow unintended documentation generation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Path Traversal] Are file paths from generator.gen() canonicalized or normalized before use? Could non-canonical paths (with ./, //, etc.) bypass directory restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Information Leak] Do the println! statements at lines 115 and 123 expose sensitive information about file system layout or internal errors that could aid attackers in reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Function: execute()] [Encoding Issues] Are file paths and content properly handled for non-ASCII characters? Could Unicode normalization issues or encoding mismatches cause file overwriting or path traversal? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-cli/src/base/docgen.rs] [Struct: Docgen] [Validation Missing] The Docgen struct fields (lines 13-56) are parsed from CLI with clap but no additional validation is performed - should there be range checks, format validation, or mutual exclusivity checks?
