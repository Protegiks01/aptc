  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [WVUF Protocol] [Threshold security] Is the threshold weight calculation (half of total weight) truly Byzantine fault tolerant, or can validator weight manipulation allow attacks with less than 1/3 Byzantine stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/types.rs] [WVUF Protocol] [Proof aggregation] Does aggregate_shares() properly validate that all proofs are for the same metadata before aggregation, preventing mixed-metadata attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/reliable_broadcast_state.rs] [Reliable Broadcast] [Partial delivery] Can Byzantine validators cause some honest validators to receive certified data while others don't, creating view divergence? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Resource management] [Broadcast handles] Are DropGuards properly cleaned up if a block is removed from the queue before randomness is ready, or do they leak memory? (Medium)",

  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Concurrency] [Mutex ordering] Are there consistent lock ordering rules between rand_store.lock(), aug_data_store access, and block_queue modifications to prevent deadlocks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/rand/rand_gen/rand_manager.rs] [Concurrency] [Channel backpressure] Can unbounded_send() on decision_rx or outgoing_blocks fail if the receiver is slow, causing randomness to be dropped? (High)",
