  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Macro: async_trait] [Cancellation safety] Are all async_trait methods cancellation-safe, meaning they can be safely dropped at any await point without leaving inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Integration: HealthChecker] [Wait timeout coupling] ServiceManager::run() calls health_checker.wait() which has a hardcoded 120-second timeout. Could this timeout be insufficient for slow-starting services, causing false failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Integration: HealthChecker] [Polling interval] HealthChecker polls every 200ms. Could this create thundering herd problems if many services simultaneously poll the same endpoint? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Integration: HealthChecker] [Health check spoofing] Since HealthChecker types like Http, NodeApi exist, could a service return a HealthChecker pointing to a malicious endpoint that always returns success, bypassing actual health validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Concurrency: Service startup] Since run() spawns services in 'any order' (line 45-46), could race conditions occur where service A assumes service B's state is X, but concurrent startup means it's actually Y? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Concurrency: Health checker wait] If multiple services wait on the same HealthChecker simultaneously, are the wait() calls properly synchronized, or could race conditions cause some services to miss the 'ready' signal? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Concurrency: Shutdown race] If shutdown occurs while services are still starting (waiting on prerequisites), could this create race conditions where some services are shutdown while others are still initializing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Error: Context wrapping] The run() method wraps errors with .context() (line 53, 57). Could deeply nested contexts cause stack overflow or make error messages unreadable? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Error: Warning without error] When run_service() returns Ok(()), a warning is logged (line 58-61). Could this mask real issues where services exit cleanly but shouldn't have? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Error: Prerequisite failure cascade] If one prerequisite service fails, does this cause a cascade where all dependent services also fail, potentially making it hard to identify the root cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Design: Box<Self> consumption] Multiple methods take Box<Self> (run, run_service, PostHealthyStep::run, ShutdownStep::run). Does this prevent implementing certain patterns like service pools or service restarts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Design: Trait visibility] The comment (line 36-37) notes that trait functions must be pub even though get_prerequisite_health_checkers should be private. Could external code misuse this function? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Design: Default implementations] Multiple methods have default implementations (pre_run, get_post_healthy_steps, get_shutdown_steps). Could services accidentally skip important operations by not overriding defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Resources: Memory leaks] If a service's run_service() spawns tasks that outlive the service lifetime, could this cause memory leaks or zombie processes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Resources: File handle leaks] If services open files or sockets and don't close them properly in shutdown steps, could the testnet exhaust file descriptors on repeated start/stop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Resources: Port binding] If services bind to network ports but don't release them in shutdown, could this prevent the testnet from restarting with 'address already in use' errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Testing: False confidence] If the local testnet has bugs that make it incorrectly report services as healthy when they're not, could this give developers false confidence leading to production bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Testing: Service mocking] Could a malicious developer create fake service implementations for testing that bypass actual security checks, and then accidentally deploy test code to production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Testing: Race condition masking] If the local testnet's health checking logic has different timing than production, could race conditions exist in production that never appear during testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Documentation: Trait requirements] The traits have minimal documentation about ordering guarantees, thread safety requirements, and error handling expectations. Could this lead to incorrect implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/traits.rs] [Documentation: Lifecycle guarantees] There's no clear documentation of the lifecycle order: pre_run() -> run() -> wait_for_prerequisites -> run_service() -> post_healthy_steps -> shutdown_steps. Could implementers get this wrong? (Low)"
