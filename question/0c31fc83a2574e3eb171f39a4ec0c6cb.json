  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-profiling/src/profile_move_vm.rs] [Function: build_binaries()] [DoS] Can repeated rapid calls to build_binaries() cause cargo lock file contention or build cache corruption, preventing successful compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-profiling/src/profile_move_vm.rs] [Function: profile_move()] [Panic] Can the unwrap() calls on path.file_name() at lines 53 and 58 panic if path is a directory or root path, causing unexpected profiling failures? (Low)",
