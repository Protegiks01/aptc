  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Edge Cases] [Empty Storage] How do all three methods behave on a completely empty storage (no genesis block)? Can they return invalid default values or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Edge Cases] [Single Block] With only genesis block (version 0, epoch 0), can get_lowest_available_version() and get_highest_synced_epoch_and_version() return the same values, breaking assumptions about ranges? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Edge Cases] [Maximum Values] How do methods handle u64::MAX values for epoch/version/timestamp? Can this cause overflow in consuming code that performs arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Edge Cases] [Epoch 0] Does the code correctly distinguish between epoch 0 (genesis) and epoch == 0 due to overflow or error? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Performance] [Repeated Calls] If peer monitoring calls all three methods for each peer, does each call independently read from storage, causing 3x disk I/O when a single read could suffice? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Performance] [Clone Cost] The LedgerInfo clone on line 40 - if LedgerInfo is large (contains full epoch state), can this cause performance degradation during high-frequency monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Performance] [Caching Absence] Without caching, does every peer monitoring request hit storage directly, potentially causing disk I/O bottlenecks when monitoring hundreds of peers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Testing] [Mock Storage] Can test code inject mock DbReader implementations that return inconsistent data (e.g., epoch 5, version 1000, timestamp 100), bypassing validation that would catch such issues in production? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [Testing] [Trait Mockability] Does the trait design allow comprehensive testing of error cases, or are certain storage corruption scenarios impossible to simulate? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [General] [Thread Safety] With the Clone + Send + 'static bounds, can StorageReader instances be used across threads without proper synchronization, causing data races in the underlying DbReader? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [General] [Lifetime Safety] Can the Arc<dyn DbReader> outlive the actual storage backend, causing use-after-free when methods try to read from deallocated storage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [General] [Error Serialization] Are Error types properly serializable for network transmission, or can serialization failures cause peer monitoring responses to be dropped? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/storage.rs] [General] [Metrics and Logging] Does the storage layer emit metrics for monitoring health, or can storage failures go undetected until they cause peer monitoring to fail catastrophically? (Low)"
