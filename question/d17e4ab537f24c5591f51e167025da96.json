  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Struct: NativeValueCacheRawTransactionExecutor] [Cache Poisoning] The DashMap cache persists across transactions - can one transaction poison the cache with invalid values affecting subsequent transactions? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: execute_transaction() - BatchTransfer] [Amount Cast] Deltas are cast to u64 with 'transfer_amount as u64' - can this truncate larger values causing fund loss? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: execute_transaction() - BatchTransfer] [Account Creation Loop] check_or_create_account is called for each recipient - can attackers create many accounts in one transaction to bypass rate limits?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor-benchmark/src/native/parallel_uncoordinated_block_executor.rs] [Function: execute_transaction() - BatchTransfer] [Create Account Resource Flag] BatchTransfer always passes true for create_account_resource - why is this different from regular Transfer logic?
