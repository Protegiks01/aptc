  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Version monotonicity] Does the code enforce that last_transaction_version increases monotonically per staking pool, or can version decreases indicate data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Struct: CurrentStakingPoolVoter] [Historical data loss] The struct only stores current state - is voter change history preserved elsewhere, or is it impossible to audit governance vote delegation over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Genesis transaction special case] GenesisTransactions are processed at lines 33-35 - can genesis-time voter assignments be manipulated differently than normal transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [BlockMetadata voter changes] BlockMetadataTransactions (lines 36-38) can modify voter state - can validators manipulate their own voter assignments through block metadata? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [UserTransaction validation] Are UserTransactions (lines 32) validated for proper authentication before voter changes are indexed, or can unauthenticated transactions affect voter tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Transaction failure handling] If a transaction failed on-chain but is in the changes list, does the indexer still process voter updates from failed transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [VM status ignored] The code doesn't check transaction execution success status - can voter changes from failed/reverted transactions be incorrectly indexed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Database: insert_current_stake_pool_voter] The database upsert at processor uses ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE - can this cause lost updates if two transactions at the same version modify different fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Database: insert_current_stake_pool_voter] The WHERE clause checks 'last_transaction_version <= EXCLUDED.last_transaction_version' - can equal versions cause non-deterministic update order? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Struct: CurrentStakingPoolVoter] [inserted_at timestamp] The processor updates inserted_at on conflict - does this timestamp represent data freshness accurately if stale version numbers are used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Database: batch insertion] If voter data is inserted in batches with chunking, can partial batch failures cause some pools to have updated voters while others remain stale? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/stake_models/staking_pool_voter.rs] [Function: from_transaction()] [Voter manipulation] If voter_address extraction is exploited to store incorrect voter addresses, can this lead to incorrect governance vote counting and proposal manipulation?
