  "[File: storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Platform word size dependency] The version counter and num_versions have different types (u64 vs usize). Could this cause issues on systems where usize is 32-bit? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_range_proof.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Signed/unsigned confusion] While all version types are unsigned, could interaction with other APIs expecting signed integers cause sign extension or truncation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/check_txn_info_hashes.rs] [Function: Cmd::run()] [Endianness in hash comparison] The hash comparison at line 46 compares HashValue objects. Are these comparisons endian-safe, or could big-endian/little-endian differences cause false mismatches?\n\n### Citations\n\n**File:** storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/ledger/mod.rs (L1-23)\n```rust\n// Copyright © Aptos Foundation\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nmod check_range_proof;\nmod check_txn_info_hashes;\n\nuse aptos_storage_interface::Result;\n\n#[derive(clap::Subcommand)]\n#[clap(about ="
