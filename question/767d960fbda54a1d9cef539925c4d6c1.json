  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer overflow] Can an attacker pass ping_interval_ms=0 or extremely small values causing integer underflow when converted to Duration, resulting in rapid ping floods that exhaust network bandwidth and CPU resources, leading to validator slowdown? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer overflow] Can ping_timeout_ms=u64::MAX cause integer overflow when converted to Duration::from_millis(), resulting in immediate timeouts or wrapping behavior that incorrectly marks healthy peers as failed and triggers mass disconnections? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can ping_interval_ms be set to an extremely large value (e.g., u64::MAX-1) causing the health checker to never ping peers, allowing Byzantine nodes to remain connected indefinitely without health validation, compromising network security? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Logic error] Can ping_timeout_ms exceed ping_interval_ms, causing overlapping ping operations where new pings are sent before previous ones timeout, leading to incorrect failure counting and premature peer disconnections? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can ping_failures_tolerated=0 cause immediate disconnection of all peers on any transient network issue, creating a network partition and loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer overflow] Can ping_failures_tolerated=u64::MAX prevent any peer from ever being disconnected due to overflow in failure comparison logic, allowing completely unresponsive or malicious nodes to remain connected? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration attack] Can an attacker with config file access set ping_interval_ms=1 and ping_failures_tolerated=1000000 to create a scenario where the health checker generates millions of ping requests per second, causing DoS on the local node? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Time manipulation] Can the time_service parameter be constructed with a manipulated TimeService that returns incorrect time values, causing the health checker to malfunction and incorrectly assess peer health? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Access control] Does the NetworkClient construction at lines 39-44 properly validate that only HealthCheckerRpc protocol is allowed, or can an attacker inject additional protocols into the vec![] direct_send_protocols to bypass health check isolation? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Resource exhaustion] Can the peers_and_metadata parameter contain an unbounded number of peer entries, causing the health checker to attempt pinging thousands of peers simultaneously and exhausting network/CPU resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [State corruption] If peers_and_metadata is shared across multiple network contexts, can concurrent modifications by different health checkers cause race conditions where peer health state becomes inconsistent across validators? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Memory exhaustion] Can a malicious node repeatedly connect and disconnect to cause unbounded growth in the peers_and_metadata Arc, leading to memory exhaustion as old peer data is never garbage collected? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Network isolation bypass] Does the hashmap construction at line 38 properly ensure network_context.network_id() is unique, or can duplicate network IDs cause message routing confusion where health checks are sent to wrong networks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Race condition] Can the HealthCheckerBuilder be constructed on one thread while another thread calls start(), creating a race where the service field is taken before initialization completes, causing a panic or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Race condition] Can start() be called multiple times concurrently from different threads, causing multiple health checker tasks to spawn for the same network, resulting in duplicate ping messages and incorrect failure accounting? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Use-after-take] After start() takes the service with self.service.take(), can subsequent calls to start() silently succeed without spawning a service, leaving the network without health checking and allowing failed peers to remain connected? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Resource leak] If the executor.spawn() operation fails after service.take(), is the HealthChecker service permanently lost without being started, leaving the network without health monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Task management] Does the spawn_named! macro properly handle task cancellation, or can orphaned health checker tasks continue running after network shutdown, holding references to closed channels and causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [State inconsistency] Can the HealthChecker be constructed with a network_rx channel that's already closed, causing the service to immediately terminate when started, leaving the network without health checking? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Channel capacity] Is the network_rx HealthCheckerNetworkEvents channel bounded, and can a slow health checker cause the channel to fill up, blocking network message processing and causing peer disconnections? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization order] Can peers be added to peers_and_metadata before the health checker is started, resulting in peers that never receive initial health checks and accumulate stale health data? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: start()] [Async runtime] If the executor Handle is from a different runtime than the one managing network operations, can this cause cross-runtime channel communication issues leading to dropped health check messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Network isolation] Can the network_context be manipulated to have an invalid or duplicate NetworkId, causing health check messages to be routed to wrong network partitions (e.g., validator network vs public network)? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/protocols/health_checker/builder.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration mismatch] If network_sender is configured for a different network_id than network_context, can this cause health check RPCs to fail silently, leaving peers without health validation? (High)"
