  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/time_service.rs] [Scenario: Leap seconds] How does get_current_timestamp() handle leap seconds - can the 1-second time adjustment cause consensus timing assumptions to fail or validators to temporarily desynchronize? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/time_service.rs] [Scenario: Validator restart] When a validator restarts, are all scheduled tasks from run_after() lost, and can this cause consensus to miss critical timeout events leading to liveness failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/util/time_service.rs] [Scenario: Runtime shutdown] If the tokio runtime is shutting down while tasks are scheduled in run_after(), can task execution fail silently or cause panics that corrupt consensus state? (High)"
