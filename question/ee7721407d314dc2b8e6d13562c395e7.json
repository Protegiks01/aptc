  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Weak RNG] Can an attacker predict the RNG seed used in key_generator() to precompute validator private keys before genesis, enabling them to compromise validator nodes and steal staked funds at network launch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Insufficient entropy] Does the RngArgs key_generator() provide cryptographically secure entropy, or can low-entropy sources allow key recovery through brute force attacks on the generated consensus and network keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Key reuse] If generate_key_objects() is called multiple times with the same RNG state, could duplicate private keys be generated for different validators, allowing one validator to impersonate another and double-sign blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to execute() create race conditions in file writing operations (lines 82-97), potentially causing key material to be written to wrong files or corrupting private-keys.yaml? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Directory traversal] Can an attacker manipulate self.output_dir to contain path traversal sequences (../, /etc/, etc.) to write private keys to arbitrary filesystem locations, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Pool address injection] At line 75, can an attacker provide a malicious pool_address that collides with system accounts or other validators' addresses, causing stake to be misdirected or enabling validator impersonation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [File permission bypass] Does write_to_user_only_file() properly enforce 0600 permissions on all platforms, or can attackers on Windows/macOS read private-keys.yaml due to permission model differences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between check_if_file_exists() (lines 64-67) and write_to_user_only_file() (lines 82-97), can an attacker create symbolic links to overwrite arbitrary files with private key material? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Missing validation] Does pool_address undergo validation to ensure it's not a reserved system address (0x0, 0x1, etc.), or can attackers set pool_address to 0x1 and potentially interfere with framework operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Key material leakage] Are the validator_blob and vfn_blob objects properly zeroized from memory after being written to disk, or does sensitive key material remain in heap allowing memory dump attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Unsafe deserialization] Does to_yaml() (lines 85, 90, 95, 97) properly escape special characters in key data, or can malformed keys inject YAML directives that execute code when the files are later parsed? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Panic-based DoS] If create_dir_if_not_exist() fails at line 80, does the function leave the filesystem in an inconsistent state with some key files created but not others, breaking the genesis ceremony? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Return value manipulation] Can an attacker who gains control of the return value at lines 98-103 cause the CLI to report success while actual key files were not written correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Weak key validation] Does generate_key_objects() validate that generated keys meet minimum security requirements (key length, not all zeros, proper curve points), or can weak keys be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Account address collision] If pool_address is set at line 75, can it collide with the operator's account_address from private_identity, causing confusion in stake pool ownership? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Error handling bypass] If write_to_user_only_file() returns an error for one file but succeeds for others (lines 82-97), does execute() properly clean up partial state, or are inconsistent key sets left on disk? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Prompt bypass] Can check_if_file_exists() be bypassed by manipulating prompt_options to automatically overwrite existing validator keys, potentially replacing legitimate validator credentials? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Path injection] Can output_dir contain null bytes or other special characters that break file path handling in write_to_user_only_file(), causing keys to be written to unintended locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [RNG state pollution] If key_generator() from rng_args uses a PRNG that maintains global state, can successive calls to GenerateKeys leak information about previously generated keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: GenerateKeys::execute()] [Filename constant vulnerability] Are PRIVATE_KEYS_FILE, PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE, VALIDATOR_FILE, and VFN_FILE (lines 28-31) hardcoded strings that could conflict with system files or be predictable for attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/genesis/keys.rs] [Function: SetValidatorConfiguration::execute()] [Identity file manipulation] Can an attacker replace owner_public_identity_file with a malicious PublicIdentity to register a validator with keys they control, stealing validator rewards? (Critical)",
