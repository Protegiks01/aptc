  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Index Completeness] Can gaps in index entries (due to write failures) cause some stale state values to never be pruned, leading to storage leaks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Time-Based Attacks] Can an attacker manipulate system time or version clocks to cause stale_since_version values that are in the future, preventing pruning indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Schema Design] [Pruning Window Bypass] By carefully crafting stale_since_version values just outside the pruning window, can an attacker cause selective retention of specific state values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/stale_state_value_index/mod.rs] [Function: encode_seek_key()] [Precision Loss] Does to_be_bytes() maintain full u64 precision, or can precision loss during conversion cause seek operations to miss target versions? (Medium)"
