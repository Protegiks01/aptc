  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::CoinTransfer] [Integer overflow] Can the invalid_transaction_ratio field overflow when set to usize::MAX, causing modulo operations or ratio calculations to panic or produce incorrect invalid transaction counts that bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::CoinTransfer] [Logic bypass] If invalid_transaction_ratio is set to a value >= 100, does the transaction generator correctly handle this edge case, or could it generate 100% invalid transactions causing complete transaction pool poisoning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::AccountGeneration] [Integer overflow] Can max_account_working_set overflow when multiplied with creation_balance during memory allocation, causing heap corruption or DoS when creating large numbers of accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::AccountGeneration] [Resource exhaustion] If creation_balance is set to u64::MAX and max_account_working_set is large, can an attacker drain the root account by requesting creation of millions of accounts with maximum balances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::PublishPackage] [Type confusion] Can the pre_built static lifetime reference be exploited through use-after-free if the PreBuiltPackages trait object is deallocated while still referenced by transaction generators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::CallCustomModules] [Memory safety] Can the Box<dyn EntryPointTrait> be manipulated to cause double-free or use-after-free when the entry_point is cloned or moved between threads during transaction generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::CallCustomModulesMix] [Resource exhaustion] If the entry_points Vec contains thousands of entry points with large weights, can this cause integer overflow in weight calculations or unbounded memory allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::BatchTransfer] [Integer overflow] Can batch_size be set to usize::MAX causing overflow when calculating total transfer amounts (batch_size * SEND_AMOUNT), potentially minting unlimited tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType::Workflow] [Type confusion] Can the Box<dyn WorkflowKind> trait object be exploited through vtable manipulation to execute arbitrary code during workflow transaction generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Enum: TransactionType] [Clone safety] Does the Clone implementation for TransactionType properly handle the trait objects (Box<dyn EntryPointTrait>, Box<dyn WorkflowKind>), or can cloning cause double-free or dangling pointer issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Constant: SEND_AMOUNT] [Hardcoded value] The SEND_AMOUNT constant is hardcoded to 1 - can this be exploited in batch transfers where batch_size * 1 might not properly validate against account balances, allowing transactions that should fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TransactionGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Integer overflow] Can num_to_create parameter overflow when implementations multiply it with transaction size or amount, causing memory corruption or incorrect transaction generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TransactionGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Sequence number race] If multiple threads call generate_transactions concurrently on the same account, can sequence numbers become desynchronized, causing transaction replay or rejection DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: TransactionGenerator::generate_transactions()] [Resource exhaustion] If num_to_create is set to usize::MAX, can this cause unbounded memory allocation in the Vec<SignedTransaction> return value, leading to OOM crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ReliableTransactionSubmitter::get_account_balance()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to get_account_balance return stale or inconsistent balance values during transaction execution, causing double-spending or overdraft? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ReliableTransactionSubmitter::query_sequence_number()] [Replay attack] If query_sequence_number returns cached or stale sequence numbers, can an attacker generate transactions with duplicate sequence numbers causing replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ReliableTransactionSubmitter::execute_transactions()] [Default implementation] The default implementation creates a new CounterState with empty by_client HashMap - can this cause memory leaks or incorrect metrics when used repeatedly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ReliableTransactionSubmitter::execute_transactions_with_counter()] [State corruption] If execute_transactions_with_counter is called concurrently with the same CounterState, can AtomicUsize operations race causing incorrect success/failure counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-generator-lib/src/lib.rs] [Trait: ReliableTransactionSubmitter::create_counter_state()] [Resource leak] Does create_counter_state properly initialize all fields, or can uninitialized HashMap entries cause undefined behavior when accessed? (Medium)",
