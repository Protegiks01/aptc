  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: CanonicalGitIdentity::new()] [Regex Injection] If canonical identities are later used in regex patterns for filtering or matching, can special regex metacharacters in hostnames or paths cause regex injection vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Filename Encoding] If canonical identities are used as filenames or directory names, can special filesystem characters (/, \\\\, :, null) in the canonical form cause path traversal or file creation failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Case Sensitivity Mismatch] On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), can canonical identities that differ only by case map to the same file, causing cache collisions with security implications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Symlink Attacks] If the cache directory structure is based on canonical identities, can attackers create symlinks with predictable canonical names to redirect cache operations to arbitrary filesystem locations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Clone Cost] The structs derive Clone which clones the underlying String - can repeated cloning of canonical identities cause performance issues or memory fragmentation in hot paths processing many package dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Ownership Transfer] Are there scenarios where canonical identities are unnecessarily cloned instead of borrowing? Could this introduce use-after-free bugs if borrowed references outlive the owner? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Transitive Equality] Do the Eq implementations maintain transitivity across all edge cases (e.g., NaN-like states)? Could broken transitivity cause cache lookup inconsistencies where A==B and B==C but A!=C? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Ordering Stability] Is the Ord implementation stable across different Rust versions and platforms? Could ordering changes cause cache invalidation or migration issues during validator upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Authority Parsing] Does the url crate properly parse the authority component (user:pass@host:port)? Can malformed authorities with multiple @ symbols cause parsing ambiguities affecting canonicalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Port Override] Can user-specified ports override protocol default ports in unexpected ways? For example, can https://host:443 be distinguished from https://host, creating duplicate cache entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: CanonicalGitIdentity::new()] [Git URL Format Variations] Git supports multiple URL formats (https://, git://, ssh://, git@host:, file://) - are all formats properly canonicalized such that they don't create duplicate cache entries for the same repository? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: CanonicalGitIdentity::new()] [Submodule Recursion] If Move packages can have git submodules with their own URLs, can recursive submodule resolution exploit canonicalization bugs to create dependency cycles or fetch from malicious sources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: CanonicalGitIdentity::new()] [Git LFS Abuse] If repositories use Git Large File Storage (LFS), can attackers manipulate canonical identities to cause validators to download enormous files, causing storage exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Prover Dependency Resolution] If the Move Prover uses canonical identities to resolve specification dependencies, can canonicalization bugs cause the prover to use wrong specification files, breaking formal verification guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Specification Injection] Can attackers substitute malicious Move specifications by exploiting canonical identity collisions, causing the prover to verify contracts against incorrect specifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Cache Isolation] If multiple users or contracts share the same package cache on a validator, are canonical identities properly namespaced to prevent cross-user cache poisoning? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Integration] [Permission Boundary] Can canonical identities be used to bypass filesystem permission boundaries, allowing unprivileged users to read or modify cached packages belonging to other users? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Empty Component Handling] What happens if the URL has empty components (e.g., scheme://host//path with double slashes)? Are they normalized correctly or could they create canonicalization inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: CanonicalGitIdentity::new()] [Alternative Git Extensions] While the code strips .git, are other git-related extensions (.bundle, .pack) also stripped? Could repositories with these extensions be misidentified? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Function: Both new() functions] [Internationalization] Are non-ASCII characters in paths properly handled after to_ascii_lowercase()?

Can equivalent but differently encoded paths create different canonical identities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-package-cache/src/canonical.rs] [Struct: Both Identity Structs] [Debug Output Safety] The Debug derive exposes the internal string - if canonical identities are logged in production with sensitive information, can debug output leak credentials or private repository names?
