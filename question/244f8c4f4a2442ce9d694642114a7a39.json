  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Error: expect() panic] [Crash vulnerability] The expect() call on line 59 panics if Options extension is missing - can attackers trigger compilation without properly initialized GlobalEnv to cause compiler crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/src/pipeline/lint_processor.rs] [Error: Checker panic] [Uncaught exception] If lint.check() panics (line 40), is the panic caught and handled, or does it crash the entire compilation preventing other functions from being validated? (High)",
