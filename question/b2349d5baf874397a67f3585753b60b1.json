  "[File: backup.rs] [Proof client trust] Lines 167-168 fetch transaction range proof from client without validation - can client provide proofs that don't match the transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: backup.rs] [Transaction count manipulation] Client is expected to return exactly num_transactions, but check is only at line 111 - can client return more or fewer to cause inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: backup.rs] [Record bytes trust] Lines 88-105 process record_bytes from client without schema validation - can malformed records cause deserialization failures during restore? (Medium)",
  "[File: backup.rs] [Storage backend trust] BackupStorage trait methods are called without validating returned FileHandles - can malicious storage backend return invalid handles? (High)",
  "[File: backup.rs] [Random suffix collision] Line 74 calls create_backup_with_random_suffix() - how many bits of entropy in the suffix, and can collisions occur with probability > negligible? (Low)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Storage read manipulation] Line 106 calls storage.open_for_read() - can malicious storage return different data on repeated reads of same handle? (High)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [BCS file loading] Line 149 calls storage.load_bcs_file() - does this validate BCS format before deserializing, or can malformed BCS cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Transaction signature validation] Transactions are loaded and replayed, but where are signatures validated - before or after restore? (High)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Genesis transaction handling] Can restore process be used to replay genesis transactions, and if so, can this reset critical system state? (Critical)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Transaction type validation] Lines 113-138 deserialize Transaction enum variants - are all variants safely handled during replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [WriteSet validation] write_sets are extracted at lines 119, 137 and replayed - are WriteSets validated to prevent unauthorized state modifications? (Critical)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Event validation] event_vecs are extracted and used in replay - can malicious events cause issues in downstream event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [ChunkExecutor state accumulation] A single ChunkExecutor instance at line 658 is reused for all chunks - can state accumulation between chunks cause incorrect execution? (High)",
  "[File: restore.rs] [Enqueue chunks validation] Line 677 calls chunk_replayer.enqueue_chunks() with verify_execution_mode - what modes are available and can permissive modes be exploited? (High)"
