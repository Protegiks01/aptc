  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Authentication Bypass] Can any arbitrary peer send Subscribe requests without authentication, allowing unauthorized nodes to receive consensus data and potentially enabling eclipse attacks or information disclosure? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the Subscribe request handler validate that the requesting peer is an authorized validator or observer, or can malicious non-validator nodes subscribe to consensus updates? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: add_active_subscriber()] [Access Control] Can a Byzantine validator subscribe multiple times from different network IDs to amplify their view of consensus messages and gain timing advantages? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Authorization] Is there any validation of peer permissions before accepting Unsubscribe requests, or can an attacker unsubscribe legitimate observers by spoofing their PeerNetworkId?

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to publish_message() and garbage_collect_subscriptions() create a race condition where messages are sent to peers that are being removed, causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: get_active_subscribers()] [TOCTOU] Does the clone operation in get_active_subscribers() followed by iteration in publish_message() create a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use vulnerability where the subscriber list changes between read and use? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: add_active_subscriber()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent Subscribe requests from the same peer create race conditions in the RwLock write operation, potentially causing duplicate subscriptions or corrupted HashSet state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Race Condition] Can the garbage collection process run concurrently with multiple add_active_subscriber() calls, leading to newly added subscribers being immediately removed incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Concurrency] Can the tokio::select! in start() create race conditions where network messages and garbage collection timers execute simultaneously, corrupting the active_subscribers state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Concurrency] Does the non-blocking try_send() operation combined with concurrent publisher calls create a scenario where messages arrive out-of-order at subscribers, breaking consensus message ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent spawning of blocking serialization tasks cause race conditions where messages are serialized and sent in non-deterministic order despite buffered() guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: remove_active_subscriber()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent unsubscribe and publish operations cause a subscriber to receive partial message streams, leading to incomplete consensus state at observers? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Struct: ConsensusPublisher] [Data Race] Can the Arc<RwLock<HashSet<PeerNetworkId>>> be accessed by multiple cloned ConsensusPublisher instances simultaneously, creating data races during read/write operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: process_network_message()] [Race Condition] Can processing Subscribe and Unsubscribe messages concurrently from the same peer create race conditions where the peer's subscription state becomes inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: add_active_subscriber()] [Resource Exhaustion] Is there any limit on the number of active subscribers, or can an attacker subscribe thousands of peers to exhaust memory and cause consensus publisher crash? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Channel Overflow] Can rapid consensus message generation combined with slow serialization cause the outbound_message_sender channel to fill up and drop messages via try_send(), causing observers to lose consensus updates? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Attack] Can an attacker manipulate the max_network_channel_size configuration to be extremely small, causing immediate channel saturation and dropping all consensus messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Task Exhaustion] Can flooding the outbound_message_receiver with messages cause spawn_blocking() to create unbounded tokio tasks, exhausting system threads and causing validator node crash? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does cloning ConsensusObserverDirectSend messages for every subscriber cause memory exhaustion when there are many subscribers and large block payloads? (High)",
