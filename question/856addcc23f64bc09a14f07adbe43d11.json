  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: new()] [Construction race] If multiple threads construct AggregatorOverriddenStateView instances concurrently with different base_view references, could initialization races cause some instances to have corrupted state pointers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] The time-of-check (StateKey comparison at line 42) to time-of-use (override at line 47) gap could allow the base_view state to change between checks - could this cause non-deterministic execution across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Struct: AggregatorOverriddenStateView] [Shard isolation failure] If the same struct instance is shared across shards rather than cloned, could mutations to the base_view reference by one shard affect reads by other shards, violating shard isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Atomic commitment] When aggregating results from multiple shards, is the total supply delta applied atomically, or could partial failures cause some shards' deltas to be applied while others are lost, corrupting total supply? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Cross-shard validation gap] If one shard reads total supply through the override while another shard modifies the base_view's actual total supply concurrently, could this create a validation gap where supply constraints are bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Serialization format mismatch] If the actual total supply in base_view is serialized with a different BCS format than bcs::to_bytes() at line 31, could deserialization fail in components expecting a specific format, causing execution errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Endianness inconsistency] Does bcs::to_bytes() guarantee consistent endianness across different validator architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V), or could byte order differences cause state root mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Unwrap panic exploitation] The .unwrap() at line 32 assumes BCS serialization of u128 never fails - could a malicious compiler or memory corruption cause serialization to fail, triggering a panic that crashes validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Vector capacity attack] The .into() conversion at line 33 wraps bytes in a Vec - could extremely large total_supply_aggr_base_val values cause excessive memory allocation, leading to OOM crashes during serialization? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [BCS canonical encoding] Does the BCS encoding at line 31 use canonical encoding rules, or could multiple valid encodings of the same u128 value cause state root divergence across validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: total_supply_base_view_override()] [Metadata loss] By creating a new StateValue without preserving metadata from the original base_view value, could important version or timestamp information be lost, affecting state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Deserialization attack] If an attacker corrupts the base_view to contain invalid BCS data for TOTAL_SUPPLY_STATE_KEY, could the read at line 46 trigger deserialization errors that cascade to other state queries?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/sharded_block_executor/aggr_overridden_state_view.rs] [Function: get_state_value()] [Version mismatch] If the base_view returns a versioned StateValue but the override returns an unversioned legacy value, could version checking in subsequent code paths reject the override value as invalid?
