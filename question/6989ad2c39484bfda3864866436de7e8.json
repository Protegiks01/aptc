  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: execute_and_update_state()] [Committed check bypass] At line 217, can committed_block_id comparison be bypassed allowing execution of blocks not descended from committed state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: ledger_update()] [Committed state assumption] At line 271, does committed_block_id reflect actual persisted state, or can it lead execution ahead of committed storage causing divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: commit_ledger()] [Root block manipulation] Can block_tree.root_block() at line 374 be manipulated between commit attempts to cause incorrect retry validation? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: commit_ledger()] [Consensus block ID mismatch] Can ledger_info.consensus_block_id() at line 366 differ from actual committed block, causing wrong block to be marked as committed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: ledger_update()] [Hash value substitution] Between retrieval and usage of blocks, can block IDs be substituted to cause ledger update on different blocks than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Execution flow] [Ordering violation] Can commit_ledger be called before pre_commit_block completes, violating the pre-commit → commit ordering and corrupting ledger? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Execution flow] [State checkpoint skip] Can pre_commit_block be called before ledger_update, causing pre-commit without completed state checkpoint and ledger update? (Critical)",
