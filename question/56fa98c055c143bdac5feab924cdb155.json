  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: run_on_abort()] [Abort session ordering] Does run_on_abort() execute after the main Txn session but before Epilogue as intended by session_counter(), or can race conditions cause abort handlers to run out of order breaking transaction atomicity? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: run_on_abort()] [Script hash in abort] Why does RunOnAbort include script_hash from the original transaction - can this allow attackers to execute different abort handler code by manipulating script_hash during abort processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: epilogue_meta()] [Epilogue skipping] Can transactions complete successfully without executing their corresponding Epilogue session, bypassing gas fee charges or event emission? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: epilogue_meta()] [Epilogue-Txn desync] Can epilogue_meta() create Epilogue sessions with (sender, sequence_number, script_hash) that don't match the Txn session they're supposed to finalize, causing cross-transaction pollution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: epilogue_meta()] [Orderless epilogue timing] For OrderlessTxnEpilogue, can expiration_time checks be bypassed by manipulating the timestamp, allowing expired transactions to finalize and charge gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: epilogue_meta()] [Multiple epilogues] Can a single transaction trigger multiple epilogue sessions (both Epilogue and OrderlessTxnEpilogue variants), double-charging gas or double-incrementing sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: void()] [Void abuse] Can attackers exploit Void sessions in production (not just simulation) to execute transactions without proper validation, gas charges, or state commitment? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: void()] [Void session counter] The session_counter() assigns Void a value of 5 - can this collide with other session types in the monotonically_increasing_number calculation, breaking uniqueness guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: validator_txn()] [Validator transaction spoofing] Can non-validator accounts create ValidatorTxn sessions by crafting transactions that hash to the same script_hash as legitimate validator transactions, bypassing validator-only privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: validator_txn()] [Hash to vec conversion] The txn.hash().to_vec() conversion creates a new Vec - can extremely large hash values cause memory exhaustion when many ValidatorTxn sessions are created simultaneously? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: validator_txn()] [Validator txn uniqueness] Does ValidatorTxn properly ensure unique script_hash values per validator transaction, or can duplicate validator transactions with identical hashes create session collisions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: as_uuid()] [UUID collision] Since as_uuid() directly returns self.hash(), can different SessionId variants produce identical HashValues, breaking UUID uniqueness assumptions in dependent code? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: as_uuid()] [Hash determinism] Does the CryptoHash trait guarantee deterministic hashing across all SessionId variants, or can implementation differences cause validator state divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: as_uuid()] [Hash function security] Is the underlying hash() function collision-resistant for all possible SessionId configurations, or can attackers find collisions by exploiting weak hash combinations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: into_script_hash()] [Script hash extraction] Can into_script_hash() be called multiple times on the same SessionId (consuming it each time), or does the consuming self parameter prevent misuse but enable use-after-move vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: into_script_hash()] [Empty script hash] For BlockMeta, Genesis, Void, BlockEpilogue, and BlockMetaExt variants returning vec![], can callers safely assume empty script_hash means no script execution, or can this break validation logic expecting non-empty hashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: into_script_hash()] [Vector ownership] When into_script_hash() returns script_hash ownership, can the caller mutate the Vec and affect other references to the same script_hash (if Clone wasn't called), breaking immutability assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: into_script_hash()] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] The match statement covers all variants, but if new SessionId variants are added, will the compiler catch missing match arms in into_script_hash() preventing runtime panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Counter collision] Can multiple different SessionId variants return the same session_counter() value (e.g., Genesis=0 colliding with future variants), breaking monotonically_increasing_number uniqueness within a transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Ordering violation] The comment states 'Prologue < Txn < RunOnAbort < Epilogue' ordering, but can transactions be executed out of order due to parallel processing, breaking the session_counter() sequence assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Counter overflow] With only u8 for session_counter (max 255), if new session types are added, can counter values wrap around or collide, breaking the 8-bit session_counter_inside_transaction field in monotonically_increasing_number?

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Arbitrary counter values] For session types like Void=5, BlockMeta=10, ValidatorTxn=20 with gaps, can attackers exploit these gaps by creating custom SessionId variants with intermediate counter values? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [Sub-session uniqueness] Does session_counter() guarantee that sub-sessions (Prologue, Txn, RunOnAbort, Epilogue) of the same transaction have monotonically increasing counters, or can out-of-order execution violate this? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/move_vm_ext/session/session_id.rs] [Function: session_counter()] [BlockEpilogue ordering] BlockEpilogue has counter=65 (highest value) - does this ensure it always runs last after all transaction epilogues, or can transaction epilogues with counter=55/60 execute after BlockEpilogue?
