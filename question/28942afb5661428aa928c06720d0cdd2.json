  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionAuxiliaryDataSchema] [MAC absence] Since auxiliary data has no message authentication code, can an attacker with filesystem access modify RocksDB files to inject false error messages that decode_value() accepts as legitimate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Length extension attack] Can an attacker append extra bytes to the 8-byte big-endian version key that RocksDB stores but decode_key() doesn't validate, allowing hidden metadata to be smuggled into the key space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Signature bypass] Does TransactionAuxiliaryData require cryptographic signatures to verify authenticity, or can decode_value() accept any well-formed BCS data without validating it came from a legitimate source? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Storage exhaustion] Can an attacker spam failed transactions with maximum-size VMErrorDetail messages that encode_value() faithfully stores, exhausting disk space and forcing validator nodes to crash? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [CPU exhaustion] Can maliciously crafted BCS data with nested structures cause bcs::from_bytes() to consume excessive CPU during decode_value(), slowing down all auxiliary data queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionAuxiliaryDataSchema] [Iterator DoS] Can an attacker create millions of failed transactions to populate TRANSACTION_AUXILIARY_DATA_CF_NAME with huge datasets, causing get_transaction_auxiliary_data_iter() to hang when iterating over the data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Query amplification] Can repeated calls to decode_key() for non-existent versions cause RocksDB to perform expensive disk seeks, amplifying a small number of queries into significant I/O load? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Batch size attack] Can an attacker fill a SchemaBatch with millions of auxiliary data entries that encode_key() must process, causing write_schemas() to timeout and fail batch commits? (Medium)"
