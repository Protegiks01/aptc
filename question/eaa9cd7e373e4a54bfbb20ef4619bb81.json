  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Performance] [BTreeMap construction] Creating BTreeMap from exclude_txns on every request - can large exclusion lists cause O(n log n) performance degradation enabling DoS through slow transaction filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Performance] [Channel cloning] Does mempool_sender.clone() on every pull_internal() call cause excessive Arc increment/decrement operations leading to contention and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Performance] [Metrics overhead] Are the counter and latency metric operations optimized, or can high-frequency updates cause lock contention that degrades overall consensus performance? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Resource] [Memory leak] If callbacks are never consumed (e.g., consensus crashes), do oneshot channels properly clean up, or can this leak memory over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Resource] [Channel buffering] Are there limits on how many pending QuorumStoreRequest messages can accumulate in mempool_sender, or can unbounded queueing exhaust memory? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Integration] [Mempool trust] Does this component trust mempool to return valid SignedTransaction objects, or should there be additional validation before passing to consensus? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Integration] [Consensus trust] Does this component trust consensus to send valid GetPayloadCommand requests, or can malformed requests from compromised consensus components cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Integration] [Version mismatch] Can mismatched versions of QuorumStoreRequest/Response between this component and mempool cause deserialization failures or type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Integration] [Monitor macro] The monitor!() macro usage - can malicious implementations of this macro intercept sensitive data or cause side effects that compromise consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/direct_mempool_quorum_store.rs] [Integration] [Counter dependency] If the counters module is compromised, can false metrics hide ongoing attacks or trigger unnecessary alerts that mask real issues? (Low)"
