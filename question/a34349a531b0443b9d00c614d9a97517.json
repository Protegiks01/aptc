  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Deserialization vulnerability] Can an attacker provide maliciously crafted BCS bytes with incorrect length fields that cause bcs::from_bytes to panic or consume excessive memory, leading to validator node crashes or denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Type confusion] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes that deserialize to a CollectionDescriptionMutate struct with type-confused fields (e.g., swapping creator_addr bytes with string data), bypassing type safety and causing undefined behavior when accessed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Integer overflow] Does the BCS deserialization handle string length fields correctly, or can an attacker provide a u64::MAX length value that causes integer overflow during memory allocation, potentially leading to heap corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Truncated data] Can an attacker provide incomplete BCS bytes that are truncated mid-field, causing try_from_bytes to fail gracefully with an error, or does it expose internal deserialization state that could leak sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Extra trailing bytes] Does the deserialization validate that all input bytes are consumed, or can an attacker append extra malicious data after valid CollectionDescriptionMutate bytes that gets ignored but could be exploited in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker craft BCS bytes with extremely large string fields (e.g., gigabytes for collection_name or new_description) that cause try_from_bytes to allocate unbounded memory, leading to OOM crashes on validator nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Recursive deserialization] Could nested or recursive BCS structures exploit the deserialization process to cause stack overflow, even though CollectionDescriptionMutate appears flat, through crafted bytes that confuse the BCS parser? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling bypass] Does try_from_bytes properly propagate all deserialization errors through anyhow::Result, or can certain error conditions be silently ignored, allowing partially-deserialized invalid structs to be used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [String validation] Are the collection_name, old_description, and new_description strings validated for maximum length, or can an attacker emit events with multi-gigabyte strings that cause indexers and explorers to crash or consume excessive resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Unicode injection] Can an attacker inject malicious Unicode characters (e.g., right-to-left override, zero-width characters, homoglyphs) into collection_name or description fields to spoof collection identities and deceive users into interacting with fake collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Control characters] Can an attacker include null bytes (0x00) or other control characters in the string fields that cause parsing errors in indexers, breaking event processing pipelines or enabling injection attacks in downstream systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Empty strings] Are empty strings allowed for collection_name or description fields, and if so, can this be exploited to create collection events that break indexer assumptions about non-empty identifiers, causing database constraint violations or query errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [String encoding validation] Does the deserialization verify that strings are valid UTF-8, or can an attacker provide invalid UTF-8 sequences that cause panics when the strings are later used, displayed, or compared? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Normalization attacks] Can an attacker create two events with visually identical but canonically different collection_name strings (e.g., using different Unicode normalization forms NFD vs NFC) to bypass deduplication logic or confuse collection tracking systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [SQL injection via strings] If indexers directly interpolate the collection_name or description strings into SQL queries without proper escaping, can an attacker inject SQL commands to compromise the indexer database? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [XSS via descriptions] Can malicious JavaScript or HTML code in new_description fields be reflected in explorer UIs without sanitization, enabling cross-site scripting attacks against users viewing collection details? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Address spoofing] Does the struct validate that creator_addr is a valid non-zero address, or can an attacker emit events with creator_addr = 0x0 to spoof system-level collections or bypass creator authentication checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Reserved address abuse] Can an attacker use reserved system addresses (e.g., 0x1, 0x3, 0x4) as creator_addr to make their collections appear as official framework collections, deceiving users about collection legitimacy? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: creator_addr()] [Reference safety] Does the creator_addr() getter return a reference that could outlive the CollectionDescriptionMutate struct in unsafe contexts, potentially causing use-after-free vulnerabilities in consuming code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Struct: CollectionDescriptionMutate] [Address collision] Can an attacker exploit hash collisions in AccountAddress to create events with conflicting creator addresses that map to the same shortened address representation in UIs, causing collection identity confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Does the new() constructor perform any validation on input parameters, or can callers create CollectionDescriptionMutate instances with arbitrary invalid data (e.g., old_description != new_description invariant not checked)? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/collection_description_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [No-op mutations] Can an attacker create events where old_description equals new_description, emitting spurious mutation events that pollute event logs and increase gas costs for indexers without actual state changes? (Low)",
