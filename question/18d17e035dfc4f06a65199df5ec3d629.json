  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Rogue Key Attack] Could an attacker create multiple ThresholdConfigBlstrs instances with overlapping player sets but different thresholds, enabling rogue key attacks where they participate in multiple DKG instances and combine shares inappropriately? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Domain Reuse Attack] If the same evaluation domains (with same roots of unity) are reused across multiple DKG instances with different player sets, could this enable cross-protocol attacks where shares from one instance are replayed in another? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Prime Order Assumption] Does the code verify that the order of the evaluation domain is prime or has specific properties required for secure polynomial interpolation, or could composite orders enable small subgroup attacks on PVSS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Integer Wraparound] In the validation t > n at line 118, could integer overflow in the comparison (e.g., if n wraps around to a small value) cause the check to pass when it should fail, allowing invalid threshold configurations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [usize vs u64 Confusion] When n is converted to u64 in domain initialization (since Scalars may be u64-based), could platforms with different usize sizes (32-bit vs 64-bit) have inconsistent behavior, causing cross-platform DKG incompatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Subtraction Underflow] If any code downstream computes n-t or t-1 without checking for underflow (when t=1 or t=n), could underflow cause incorrect threshold calculations in Lagrange interpolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Power of Two Overflow] When BatchEvaluationDomain finds the smallest power of 2 >= n, could the power-of-two calculation overflow for large n values near usize::MAX/2, causing the domain size to wrap to a small value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Field Size Mismatch] If t and n are stored as usize but used in scalar field arithmetic expecting u64, could truncation or sign extension cause mismatches between intended and actual threshold values in cryptographic operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Error Message Information Leak] The error messages at lines 111, 115, and 119-121 include the actual t and n values - could these leak sensitive information about validator set size if error messages are logged and exposed to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Panic in Domain Creation] If EvaluationDomain::new() or get_subdomain() panic internally (e.g., due to assertion failures), could this cause validator crashes during DKG initialization, leading to liveness failures at epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Error Path Validation] If deserialization fails and returns Err, are all partially-constructed fields properly cleaned up, or could memory leaks or corrupted state remain that affects subsequent DKG operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Unwrap Usage] Does any code path use unwrap() or expect() on Results returned by domain operations, and could this cause panics in production validators if domain creation fails unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Serialization Determinism] When the struct is serialized, only t and n are included (dom and batch_dom skipped) - could this cause non-deterministic behavior if validators deserialize and rebuild domains in different orders, causing FFT result mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Partial Serialization Attack] Since dom and batch_dom are marked #[serde(skip)], could an attacker craft a scenario where serialized configs are transmitted between nodes but domain reconstruction fails on some validators, causing DKG to split the validator set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Version Compatibility] If the serialization format changes (e.g., adding new fields to ThresholdConfigBlstrs), could old validators fail to deserialize new configs, causing consensus forks during protocol upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [State Persistence] If ThresholdConfigBlstrs is persisted to disk and loaded later, could changes in the underlying BLS12-381 scalar field implementation (e.g., different root of unity generators) cause deserialized configs to have incompatible domains? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [PVSS Transcript Mismatch] When this config is used in PVSS transcript creation, if the dealer uses a different ThresholdConfigBlstrs than verifiers (e.g., different n due to race conditions), could transcripts be rejected spuriously, halting DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Share Aggregation Attack] If reconstruction requires exactly t shares but the config allows creation with any t <= n, could an attacker aggregate shares from multiple incompatible configs to forge aggregated signatures that bypass validator authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: get_total_num_shares()] [Share Distribution] Since total shares equals n, does the PVSS protocol correctly handle cases where some validators are offline and can't receive their shares, or could this cause DKG to fail when n-offline < t? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Weighted Config Confusion] Could an attacker provide a ThresholdConfigBlstrs where it's expected to be wrapped in a weighted configuration (like WeightedConfigBlstrs), bypassing weight-based threshold enforcement and allowing equal-weight attacks on stake-weighted DKG? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Reconstruction Quorum] When t players reconstruct the secret, does the code verify that the reconstructing players' weights sum to >= threshold in weighted schemes, or does it naively count players, allowing attackers with low stake to participate in reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Lifetime Issues] The getter methods return references &BatchEvaluationDomain and &EvaluationDomain - could lifetime confusion allow these references to outlive the parent ThresholdConfigBlstrs, causing use-after-free when the config is dropped? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Drop Safety] Does the struct implement Drop explicitly? If so, could double-free occur if domain fields contain pointers that are freed during drop but also referenced elsewhere? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Struct: ThresholdConfigBlstrs] [Unsafe Code] Does EvaluationDomain or BatchEvaluationDomain contain unsafe code blocks? If so, could memory safety violations in domain operations propagate to ThresholdConfigBlstrs and cause undefined behavior in DKG? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/blstrs/threshold_config.rs] [Function: new()] [Allocation Failure] If memory allocation fails during BatchEvaluationDomain::new(n) for very large n, does the code handle OOM gracefully, or could it cause validator panics or undefined behavior? (High)"
