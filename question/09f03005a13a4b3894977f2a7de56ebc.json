  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Struct: NodeArgs] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious --config-path argument containing directory traversal sequences (../../etc/passwd) to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive validator keys or system configuration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Struct: NodeArgs] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker use --test-config-override with symbolic links to bypass path restrictions and overwrite critical system files or validator private keys during node initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Struct: NodeArgs] [Configuration Injection] Can an attacker provide both --config-path and --test-config-override through command-line manipulation despite the conflicts_with directive, potentially causing configuration merge vulnerabilities or inconsistent node state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: seed] [Cryptographic Weakness] Does the --seed parameter accept weak or predictable seeds that could compromise the deterministic key generation in aptos_node::load_seed, allowing attackers to predict private keys for test validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: seed] [Entropy Depletion] If no seed is provided, the code falls back to StdRng::from_entropy() - can an attacker exhaust system entropy sources during repeated node startups, causing predictable RNG output and compromised cryptographic material generation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: txn_stream_port] [Port Injection] Can an attacker supply invalid port numbers (0, 65536+, negative values) to txn_stream_port that could cause integer overflow/underflow or bind to privileged ports, potentially hijacking system services? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: no_txn_stream] [Service State Inconsistency] When no_txn_stream is true, the indexer_grpc is disabled - can this create race conditions where dependent services (processors, indexer API) attempt to connect before detecting the service is unavailable, causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: no_node] [Hidden Flag Abuse] The --no-node flag is hidden and creates a footgun scenario - can an attacker leverage this flag in automated deployments to silently prevent node startup while other services fail, causing hard-to-diagnose network partitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Field: performance] [Configuration Tampering] When --performance flag is enabled, does it disable critical security checks or validation logic that could be exploited in production if misconfigured, leading to consensus violations or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: build_node_config()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to build_node_config with the same test_dir cause race conditions in file creation/loading, resulting in corrupted node configurations or mixed validator keys across multiple node instances? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: build_node_config()] [TOCTOU Vulnerability] Between checking if config exists and loading it via load_node_config, can an attacker perform a time-of-check-to-time-of-use attack by swapping the config file, injecting malicious node settings? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: build_node_config()] [Path Validation] Does build_node_config validate that test_dir is not a symlink to sensitive directories, potentially causing the node to write data/keys to attacker-controlled locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: build_node_config()] [Error Handling] When load_node_config fails with context 'Failed to load / create config for node', does it leak sensitive path information or internal state in error messages that could aid reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: build_node_config()] [Parameter Injection] Can an attacker manipulate the performance flag passed to load_node_config to bypass security hardening, enabling test-only optimizations that skip signature verification or gas metering? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: NodeManager::new()] [RNG State Reuse] When seed is Some, StdRng::from_seed creates deterministic RNG - can an attacker force multiple nodes to use the same seed, causing key collisions and validator impersonation across different testnet instances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: NodeManager::new()] [Seed Caching] Does the seed parameter get logged or cached in memory in plaintext, allowing attackers with memory access to reconstruct private keys generated during node initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: NodeManager::new()] [Bind Address Override] Can an attacker manipulate the bind_to parameter to bind services to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) when only localhost binding was intended, exposing test APIs to network attackers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: NodeManager::new()] [Configuration Propagation] When new_with_config is called, does improper parameter passing allow txn_stream_port to be ignored, causing services to bind to unexpected ports and creating port conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: NodeManager::new()] [Error Propagation] If build_node_config returns Ok but with a partially corrupted NodeConfig, does NodeManager::new detect this before passing to new_with_config, or does it allow invalid configurations to propagate? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [Configuration Mutation] The function directly mutates node_config without validation - can malicious config_path files inject arbitrary settings that bypass security checks in the node runtime? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [GRPC Stream Injection] When run_txn_stream is true, indexer_grpc.enabled and use_data_service_interface are set - can an attacker exploit inconsistencies between these flags to enable partial GRPC functionality that bypasses authentication? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [Port Collision] The code sets txn_stream_port via set_port without checking if the port is already in use - can this cause silent bind failures where the node appears healthy but transaction stream is unavailable? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [Table Info Mode Mismatch] When run_txn_stream is true, TableInfoServiceMode is set to IndexingOnly - can this mode be exploited to skip backup/restore validation, potentially causing state inconsistencies during node restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [IP Binding Bypass] The function sets node_config.api.address to bind_to using set_ip - can an attacker supply IPv6 addresses when IPv4 is expected, causing binding to fail or bind to unintended interfaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/local_testnet/node.rs] [Function: new_with_config()] [String Parsing Vulnerability] admin_service.address and inspection_service.address are set via to_string() without validation - can malformed IPv4 addresses cause parsing errors or bind to wildcard addresses? (Low)"
