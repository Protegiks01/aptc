  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Zero hash injection] Can an attacker inject all-zeros HashValue into TransactionInfo fields, potentially colliding with uninitialized or default state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Hash canonicalization] Are HashValue fields canonicalized before serialization, or can different representations of the same hash value cause BCS encoding ambiguity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Gas overflow] Can gas_used field overflow during deserialization if attacker provides u64::MAX value, causing integer wraparound in gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Negative gas] Can gas_used be encoded with invalid values (through BCS manipulation) that appear negative when type-cast, enabling gas refund exploits? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Gas inconsistency] Can gas_used in TransactionInfo mismatch the actual gas charged to accounts, allowing validators to extract fees without recording them? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Status enum attack] Can an attacker inject invalid ExecutionStatus enum discriminants during BCS deserialization, causing undefined behavior in status handling? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Auxiliary info injection] Can an attacker inject auxiliary_info_hash when it should be None according to protocol rules, causing downstream systems to process phantom auxiliary data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Auxiliary hash mismatch] Can auxiliary_info_hash be set without corresponding PersistedAuxiliaryInfo in storage, breaking the invariant linking these schemas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionInfoSchema] [Version migration] If TransactionInfo is upgraded from V0 to V1, can old nodes crash when encountering new format, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_info/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Backward compatibility] Does BCS deserialization handle TransactionInfo enum variants backward-compatibly, or can new variants break old nodes? (High)",
