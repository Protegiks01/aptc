  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Resource: Memory usage] [Iterator memory exhaustion] Can large-scale prefix queries that match millions of StateKeys cause the indexer to allocate excessive memory for result sets, triggering OOM kills? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Resource: Batch size] [Batch size limits] Does the indexer enforce maximum batch sizes for StateKeysSchema writes, or can single transactions with huge write sets cause unbounded batch growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Cross-schema: Transaction indexing] [Atomic indexing failure] If OrderedTransactionByAccountSchema writes succeed but StateKeysSchema writes fail within the same batch, can this create inconsistency where transactions are indexed but their state changes aren't? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Cross-schema: Event indexing] [Version metadata skew] Can mismatches between EventVersion and StateVersion metadata cause queries to see events but miss corresponding state key changes, breaking application consistency assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Cross-schema: Metadata ordering] [Metadata update timing] Does the indexer update LatestVersion metadata before or after committing StateKeysSchema entries, and can this ordering cause queries to see incomplete index states?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Config: batch_size] [Batch size manipulation] Can attackers exploit extremely large batch_size configurations to cause StateKeysSchema to process massive batches that trigger timeout or memory issues? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/state_keys/mod.rs] [Error: Encode failures] [Silent encoding errors] If encode_key() encounters an error during batch preparation but continues processing, can this lead to silent loss of some state keys in the index? (High)",
