  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Epoch boundary message handling] During epoch transitions when validator sets change, does NetworkListener continue processing messages from the old epoch? Can Byzantine validators exploit this to inject stale batches/proofs that reference outdated validator signatures? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Reconfiguration race condition] If NetworkListener is reconfigured with a new set of batch_coordinator channels during an epoch change, can Byzantine validators exploit the timing window where old and new coordinators exist simultaneously to cause message duplication or loss? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Validator set update delay] Are messages validated against the current epoch's validator set before routing? Can Byzantine validators send messages claiming to be from validators who are no longer in the active set, exploiting delayed validator set updates in NetworkListener? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Message amplification attack] Can Byzantine validators send a single small SignedBatchInfo message through NetworkListener that triggers disproportionately large proof aggregation work in proof_coordinator, creating an amplification DoS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Timing-based fingerprinting] Can Byzantine validators measure NetworkListener's processing time for different message types to fingerprint honest validators' hardware capabilities, then target slower validators with resource-intensive messages? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Coordinator index predictability] The deterministic round-robin counter (lines 78-80) makes coordinator assignment predictable - can Byzantine validators exploit this predictability to craft attacks that target specific coordinator workers in sequence? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [Message type imbalance] Can Byzantine validators send disproportionate ratios of different message types (e.g., 99% BatchMsg, 1% SignedBatchInfo) to cause resource imbalance where batch_coordinators are overloaded but proof_coordinator sits idle? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/quorum_store/network_listener.rs] [Function: start()] [PeerId validation completeness] Is the sender PeerId extracted at line 43 validated to be a current epoch validator before routing messages? Can non-validator nodes exploit NetworkListener to inject messages by connecting to the network layer? (Critical)"
