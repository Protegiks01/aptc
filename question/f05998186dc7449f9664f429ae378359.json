  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can the 'debug' attribute on the 'error' field leak sensitive error details (including stack traces, internal paths, or memory addresses) through structured logs that are accessible to operators or monitoring systems, potentially exposing attack surface information? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Does the 'debug' attribute on the 'request' field expose full PeerMonitoringServiceRequest contents including potential sensitive parameters or internal protocol details that could be exploited by malicious observers with log access? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can the 'display' trait on the 'peer' PeerNetworkId field leak network topology information (peer identifiers, network structure) that helps attackers map validator network relationships for targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Does logging 'request_id' as u64 create a predictable pattern that allows attackers to correlate requests across different log sources, enabling traffic analysis attacks on peer monitoring activities? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can the 'request_type' string field expose internal protocol versioning or feature flags that reveal node capabilities to attackers analyzing logs? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Log Injection] Does the serde 'rename_all = snake_case' serialization create predictable log patterns that can be poisoned by attackers sending specially crafted requests with malicious field names? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Log Injection] Can an attacker craft peer monitoring requests that trigger specific LogEvent values (like InvalidResponse, PeerPingError) in a controlled manner to flood logs and hide malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Injection] If the 'message' field accepts unsanitized user input or peer-provided data, can attackers inject newlines, control characters, or ANSI escape codes to corrupt log files or monitoring dashboards? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Injection] Does the Error type passed to the 'error' field contain user-controlled data that could be used for log injection attacks when formatted via Debug trait? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Deserialization Attack] Can malicious log aggregation systems exploit the Serialize-derived enums to inject corrupted LogEntry or LogEvent values during log replay or analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Derive: Schema] [Type Confusion] Does the Schema derive macro properly validate field types at compile time, or could runtime type confusion occur when logging mismatched types for 'error', 'peer', or 'request' fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Memory Safety] Are the lifetime annotations ('a) on reference fields properly enforced to prevent use-after-free when LogSchema instances are created with references to short-lived Error or PeerNetworkId objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does the LogSchema::new() constructor leave all Optional fields as None, creating a risk of null pointer dereferences or missing critical context when logs are processed by external systems expecting complete data? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Completeness] Is the LogEntry enum exhaustive for all peer monitoring scenarios, or could missing variants cause unlogged security events (e.g., authentication failures, rate limiting) that hide attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Completeness] Does the LogEvent enum adequately capture all error conditions, or could critical security events (malicious peer detection, protocol violations) be missed due to insufficient event types? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Timing Side Channel] Can attackers infer sensitive information from the timing of log emissions, such as determining when specific peers are being monitored or when latency pings occur, enabling targeted DoS during measurement windows? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Timing Side Channel] Does the TooManyPingFailures event reveal exact timing of peer connectivity issues that attackers can exploit to identify optimal moments for eclipse attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Resource Exhaustion] If 'request' field holds large PeerMonitoringServiceRequest objects, can attackers cause memory exhaustion by triggering excessive logging of complex requests during normal operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Error Handling] Does the Option<&'a Error> field properly handle all Error enum variants without panicking or exposing internal invariants when logging unexpected error types? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Error Classification] Can the ResponseError event be confused with ResponseSuccess due to improper error handling in calling code, causing security failures to be logged as successes? (High)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEvent] [Error Masking] Does the UnexpectedErrorEncountered catch-all event hide specific attack patterns (Byzantine behavior, protocol violations) that should be distinctly logged for security monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Concurrency] When multiple threads create LogSchema instances with references to shared PeerNetworkId or Error objects, can race conditions cause corrupted log entries or data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Concurrency] Does the reference-based design (&'a) create lock contention when logging occurs frequently in hot paths like the PeerMonitorLoop, potentially degrading validator performance? (Low)",
  "[File: peer-monitoring-service/client/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Serialization] Does the snake_case renaming create name collisions if future variants are added (e.g., NetworkInfo vs network_info), causing log parsing confusion in monitoring systems? (Low)",
