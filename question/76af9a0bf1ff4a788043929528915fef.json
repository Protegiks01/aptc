  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Import: use declarations] [Unsafe Imports] Line 14 allows unused imports - could this hide unsafe code that's commented out but could be re-enabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_print()] [Production Logging] If this function is ever active in production, could attackers spam debug logs to fill disk space on validators, causing storage exhaustion and validator failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_stack_trace()] [Privacy Leak] Stack traces may reveal contract implementation details, internal function names, or validator software versions - can this information help attackers identify vulnerable nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: native_old_debug_print()] [Reflection Attack] Can the ability to format and print arbitrary types via native_format_debug() be abused to perform type reflection attacks, discovering internal type structures for other exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/debug.rs] [Function: make_all()] [Registration Order] Does the order of native function registration in the array on lines 114-119 matter for security - could reordering break dependencies or access controls? (Low)"
