  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Empty Peers] What happens when get_registered_networks() returns an empty list - does the metric update loop execute correctly? (Low)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: spawn_message_serializer_and_sender()] [Empty Receiver] Can the outbound_message_receiver be empty when passed to the spawned task, causing the stream to complete immediately? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Max Subscribers] What happens when the number of subscribers approaches the maximum HashSet capacity - are there performance cliffs or allocation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: start()] [Garbage Collection Timing] Can the garbage_collection_interval_ms be set to a value that conflicts with consensus timing, causing subscribers to be removed during active consensus rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Publish Timing] Can the non-blocking nature of publish_message() combined with varying network delays cause messages to arrive at observers in different orders relative to consensus operations? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_subscriptions()] [Clock Skew] Can differences in system clock between publisher and peers cause premature or delayed garbage collection decisions? (Low)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Epoch Boundary] Can publishing messages during epoch transitions cause observers to receive messages from multiple epochs out of order, breaking consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Fork Propagation] Can the publisher inadvertently propagate messages from multiple competing forks to observers, causing them to track incorrect chain tips? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/publisher/consensus_publisher.rs] [Function: publish_message()] [Quorum Impact] If message delivery fails to more than 1/3 of observers, can this create inconsistent observer views that appear like a consensus safety violation? (High)",
