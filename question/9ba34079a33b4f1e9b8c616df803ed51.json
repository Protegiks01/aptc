(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-dkg/src/pvss/traits/mod.rs] [Trait: Transcript::verify()] [Parameter mismatch] Can Transcript::verify() be exploited by providing mismatched SecretSharingConfig, PublicParameters, or encryption keys that cause verification to pass for invalid transcripts?
