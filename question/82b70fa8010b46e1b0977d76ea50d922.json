  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Cross-module: Import manipulation] [Use statement attack] Can attackers manipulate the use statements to import different PrePartitioner or PrePartitionerConfig implementations, causing build() to return unexpected types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Shard: Distribution fairness] [Unfair allocation] Can the uniform distribution strategy be exploited by crafting transaction sets that, when evenly divided, cause specific validators to process disproportionately expensive transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Shard: Cross-shard conflicts] [Conflict amplification] Can attackers craft transaction orderings that, after uniform partitioning by build(), maximize cross-shard conflicts requiring expensive coordination between executor shards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Shard: Load imbalance] [Deliberate imbalance] Unlike ConnectedComponentPartitionerConfig with load_imbalance_tolerance, can the lack of configuration in UniformPartitionerConfig be exploited to create severe load imbalances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Type safety: Box coercion] [Type coercion attack] Can the Box<dyn PrePartitioner> type coercion in build() be exploited to bypass type safety checks and inject non-PrePartitioner types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Type safety: Trait object size] [Size assumptions] Does code assume specific sizes for Box<dyn PrePartitioner>, and can violating these assumptions through custom allocators cause memory corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Type safety: Send+Sync bounds] [Thread safety violation] Does UniformPartitionerConfig properly implement Send and Sync, or can violations lead to data races when the config is shared across executor threads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Blockchain: Transaction ordering] [Ordering manipulation] Can attackers craft block proposals where uniform partitioning produces transaction orderings that violate dependency constraints, causing execution failures?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Blockchain: Deterministic execution] [Execution divergence] If different validators use different UniformPartitionerConfig instances (due to version mismatches), can this cause execution divergence and chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Blockchain: Gas calculation] [Gas inconsistency] Can uniform partitioning cause gas calculations to differ across validators due to different shard execution patterns, violating gas consensus requirements?

  "[File: aptos-core/execution/block-partitioner/src/pre_partition/uniform_partitioner/config.rs] [Blockchain: State root divergence] [Merkle root mismatch] Can non-deterministic behavior in UniformPartitionerConfig build() cause different validators to produce different state roots after block execution?
