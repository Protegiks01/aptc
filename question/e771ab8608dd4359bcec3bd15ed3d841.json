  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Weak key rotation] Can an attacker rotate to deliberately weak authentication keys (e.g., keys with known private keys) and emit valid KeyRotation events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Key reuse across accounts] Can the same authentication key be rotated to multiple different accounts, and do the KeyRotation events properly track this to prevent confusion in OriginatingAddress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Error handling inconsistency] Does try_from_bytes() handle all BCS error cases consistently, or are there edge cases where it panics instead of returning Err? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Unicode/encoding issues] Can non-UTF8 or malformed byte sequences in authentication keys cause issues when events are serialized to JSON for API responses? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Concurrent rotation race] Can two transactions rotate the same account's key simultaneously in parallel execution, creating conflicting KeyRotation events? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Event handle race] If KeyRotationEvent and KeyRotation events are both being emitted during migration, can race conditions cause events to be lost or duplicated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Static: KEY_ROTATION_TYPE] [Static initialization race] In a multi-threaded validator, can race conditions during Lazy initialization of KEY_ROTATION_TYPE cause non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Read-modify-write race] Can an attacker exploit time-of-check-time-of-use bugs where the old_authentication_key is read, validated, and then a rotation occurs before the event is emitted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Derive: Serialize, Deserialize] [Serde exploit] Can custom Deserialize implementations be injected to bypass validation when KeyRotation is deserialized from untrusted sources? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Clone absence] Since KeyRotation doesn't implement Clone, can this create issues in code that needs to duplicate events, potentially leading to use-after-move bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/key_rotation.rs] [Struct: KeyRotation] [Send/Sync safety] Is KeyRotation properly Send + Sync for concurrent processing, or could it be transferred across thread boundaries unsafely? (Medium)",
