  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Integration: Subscription] [Overwrite Attack] Can the InvalidRequest on subscription overwrite (line 392-401) be used to detect and interfere with other peers' active subscriptions by probing indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Math: Storage Module] [Version Arithmetic] In storage.rs, do the checked_sub and checked_add operations that return UnexpectedErrorEncountered on overflow properly prevent all integer overflow attacks in version calculations? (High)",

  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Math: Subscription] [Chunk Size] Can chunk size calculations in subscription.rs overflow when computing num_versions_to_fetch, and would this be properly caught as UnexpectedErrorEncountered? (Medium)",

  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Content: All Variants] [Memory Exhaustion] Can attackers trigger error paths with unbounded String growth (e.g., recursive error messages) to exhaust memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Debug: PartialEq/Eq] [Error Comparison] Does implementing PartialEq and Eq on Error enum create any security issues where error comparison could leak information or cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Debug: Clone] [Error Cloning] Can the Clone implementation on Error be exploited to amplify error handling costs by forcing repeated cloning of large error strings? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Network: Serialization] [Wire Format] Can the serde serialization of Error types to network peers leak internal implementation details or create deserialization vulnerabilities on the receiving side? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Network: Error Responses] [Protocol Confusion] Can error responses be crafted to confuse protocol state machines on the client side, causing them to enter invalid states or hang? (Medium)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Network: Bandwidth] [Amplification] Can triggering errors with large String payloads create bandwidth amplification where small malicious requests generate large error responses? (Low)",
  "[File: state-sync/storage-service/server/src/error.rs] [Config: Thresholds] [Rate Limit Config] If max_invalid_requests_per_peer is set too high in config, can attackers send many invalid requests before triggering TooManyInvalidRequests, allowing significant probing? (Medium)",
