  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Integration: Key Rotation] Does the identity configuration support safe key rotation, or can key updates cause validators to lose consensus participation until the next epoch, reducing network decentralization? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Integration: Multi-Validator] If multiple validator processes run on the same machine, can they interfere with each other's identity files through race conditions or locking issues? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Integration: Account Address] Is the optional account_address validated against the account_private_key during validator operations, or can mismatches cause the validator to sign transactions with wrong addresses causing fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Integration: Peer ID] Can peer_id mismatches between identity configuration and actual network operations cause validators to be unable to receive blocks or votes, isolating them from consensus? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Integration: DKG Protocol] If DKG key derivation fails or produces invalid keys, does the validator gracefully exclude itself from DKG ceremonies, or does it cause the entire DKG protocol to fail affecting all validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Files] Does load_identity() properly handle empty files, or does it try to read PRIVATE_KEY_SIZE bytes causing array conversion failure and validator crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Edge Case: Zero Keys] Can all-zero private keys pass validation and be loaded into the validator, creating weak cryptographic material that could be brute-forced or exploited? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Edge Case: Maximum Path Length] Does path handling properly validate against OS maximum path length limits, or can extremely long paths cause buffer overflows or silent truncation? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Edge Case: Unicode Paths] Are Unicode paths properly handled across different filesystems (NTFS, ext4, APFS), or can encoding issues cause validators to be unable to load identity files on certain systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Edge Case: Concurrent File Modification] If identity files are modified while being read (e.g., by backup software), can partial reads cause key corruption or validator crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Identity Confusion] Can attackers exploit validators with Identity::None to inject themselves into the network without proper keys, or do protocol checks prevent un-identified validators from participating? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Time-Based] Can time-of-check-time-of-use races in path.exists() and subsequent operations be exploited to swap identity files during validator startup causing wrong key loading? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Memory Dumps] If a validator crashes during identity loading, do core dumps contain unencrypted private keys in memory that could be extracted by attackers with filesystem access? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Log Injection] Can error messages from identity operations be manipulated to inject fake log entries that hide malicious activity or create false validator status? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Environment Variables] Does any identity loading logic read from environment variables that could be manipulated by attackers to redirect key loading or leak key material? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Backup Files] Do text editors or backup systems create temporary copies of identity YAML files (e.g., *~, .swp) that persist with world-readable permissions, leaking keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: File Locking] Does the code implement proper file locking for identity files, or can concurrent access from multiple processes corrupt key material? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Attack Vector: Inode Reuse] Can inode reuse attacks where a new file uses the same inode as deleted identity file bypass permission checks or cause key confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Rust: Drop Implementation] Do key types implement Drop with secure memory wiping (e.g., zeroize), or do they leave key material in memory after deallocation vulnerable to memory scraping? (High)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Rust: Clone Safety] Are private key types properly protected against accidental cloning that could proliferate key material across memory, increasing attack surface? (Medium)",
  "[File: config/src/config/identity_config.rs] [Rust: Debug Trait] Do key types prevent Debug trait from printing sensitive material, or can debug output accidentally log private keys to files or console? (High)"
