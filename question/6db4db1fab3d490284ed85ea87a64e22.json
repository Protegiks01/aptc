  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Key Type Confusion] If find_noise_proto() returns None for a VFN, is the NodeInfo still created with public_key: None, and can this cause downstream authentication failures or bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Key Rotation] If a validator updates their VFN keys on-chain between get_validator_infos() and actual connection, can this cause authentication failures or allow MITM attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Memory Leak] The or_insert_with(Vec::new) pattern at lines 90 and 106 - if validator processing is interrupted, are partially-constructed vectors properly dropped or can they leak memory? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [String Cloning] Multiple String allocations for error messages (lines 94, 124) - with many errors, can this cause memory pressure or performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Vector Ownership] The active_validators vector is moved via into_inner() at line 42 - is this efficient, or does it cause unnecessary copying with large validator sets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Information Leakage] The info!() log at lines 43-48 exposes first and last validator addresses - can this leak sensitive information about validator set composition to attackers monitoring logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error Detail Exposure] Error messages containing {:#} formatting (lines 94, 124) - do these expose internal implementation details or stack traces that could aid attackers? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [API Version Mismatch] Does the code handle API version mismatches between the checker and the node at node_address, or can incompatible versions cause deserialization failures or incorrect data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Rate Limiting] If the REST API at node_address implements rate limiting, can repeated calls to get_validator_infos() trigger rate limits causing legitimate checks to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [TLS Validation] Does the AptosClient properly validate TLS certificates when connecting to node_address, or can a MITM attacker serve fraudulent validator data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_validator_infos()] [Redirect Following] If the REST API returns redirects, does the client follow them safely without infinite redirect loops or redirects to malicious domains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Partial Construction] If processing fails mid-way through the validator loop, are node_infos and invalid_node_address_results in a consistent state, or can they contain mismatched data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Transaction Semantics] Should the entire operation be atomic (all validators processed or none), or is partial success acceptable - can partial state cause downstream logic errors? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Single Validator] With only one validator in the set, does processing work correctly, or are there assumptions about multiple validators that could cause bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_vfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Maximum Validators] Is there a maximum number of validators the system can handle, or can processing millions of validators cause timeout or resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
