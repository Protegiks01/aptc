  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Provider state race] If the ApiIndexProvider's internal state changes between multiple get_latency_datapoint calls, can this cause non-deterministic latency measurements that don't accurately reflect node health? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Sleep precision] The tokio::time::sleep call at lines 101-104 may not be precise. Can accumulated timing errors over num_samples iterations cause the total measurement window to be significantly different than expected, affecting latency calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Async scheduling] If the tokio runtime is under heavy load, can async task scheduling delays between sample measurements cause the measured latencies to include scheduler overhead rather than actual API latency? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Clock monotonicity] Does Instant::now() guarantee monotonic time even across system suspends/resumes? Can non-monotonic time cause negative durations or panics in the elapsed() calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Concurrent modification] If multiple LatencyChecker instances run concurrently against the same provider, can this cause resource contention or state corruption in the shared provider, affecting latency measurements? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Timeout missing] The provider.provide() call at line 64 has no explicit timeout. Can a malicious or buggy provider hang indefinitely, causing the latency checker to never complete and blocking health validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Amplification attack] If num_samples is set to 65535 and delay_between_samples_ms is 0, the checker will fire 65535 rapid API requests. Can this be weaponized to DDoS the target node or exhaust network resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Memory growth] Both latencies and errors vectors can grow to num_samples size. With num_samples=65535, each Duration is 16 bytes and errors could be large objects. Can this exhaust available memory on resource-constrained systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Total timeout] The entire check() function has no overall timeout. With num_samples * (max_latency + delay) potentially being hours or days, can this cause the health checker to hang permanently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Stack exhaustion] If recursive calls or deep async call stacks occur during the num_samples loop iterations, can this exhaust stack space and cause stack overflow panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Threshold bypass] At line 110, the comparison uses strict inequality (>) to check if average_latency exceeds max_api_latency_ms. Does this mean a node with exactly max_api_latency_ms passes, which might be undesirable for strict latency requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Score manipulation] The evaluation result assigns score 50 for failure and 100 for success (lines 113, 122). Can an attacker game these scores if they're aggregated with other checks to marginally pass overall health validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Sampling bias] The latency measurements are taken sequentially with fixed delays. Can an attacker time their node's performance degradation to occur between samples, avoiding detection by only being slow when not sampled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Statistical validity] Average latency doesn't account for variance or outliers. Can a node with 4 samples at 1ms and 1 sample at 5000ms have average 1000ms, passing the check despite extreme inconsistency indicating instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Early return] If errors exceed threshold at line 89-100, the function returns early without computing average latency. Does this prevent detecting nodes that are both error-prone AND slow? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Success bias] If most samples succeed but are very slow, while some fail fast, the average only includes successful samples. Can this skew results toward passing unhealthy nodes that fail occasionally but are slow when working? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Cancellation safety] If the check() async function is cancelled or dropped mid-execution, are there any resources that won't be properly cleaned up, such as pending API requests or timers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Await point vulnerability] The await at line 64 yields control to the async runtime. Can malicious code inject delays or side effects at this point to manipulate latency measurements? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Sleep cancellation] If tokio::time::sleep at line 101-104 is cancelled, will the loop continue immediately to the next iteration, potentially violating the intended delay_between_samples_ms timing? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Provider thread safety] Is the ApiIndexProvider guaranteed to be Send + Sync? If multiple threads call check() concurrently with a shared provider reference, can this cause data races or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: LatencyChecker::new] [Send/Sync bounds] The LatencyChecker struct contains LatencyCheckerConfig. If Config contains non-Send types, can this prevent the checker from being used across threads safely? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Provider trust] The provider.provide() call is treated as trusted. Can a malicious provider implementation return immediately but claim long latency, or delay intentionally to fail health checks of competitor nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Provider availability] The get_provider! macro assumes target_api_index_provider exists. If it's None and required=false, what happens? Can this cause silent failures where nodes are never checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: get_latency_datapoint] [Result handling] The Result type from provider.provide() is converted to Duration on success. Can the provider return Ok() for failed requests, causing failed API calls to be counted as successful with arbitrary latency? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/latency.rs] [Function: check] [Provider state mutation] If provider.provide() mutates provider state (e.g., incrementing call counters, caching), can this cause non-deterministic behavior where the first call has different characteristics than subsequent calls? (Low)"
