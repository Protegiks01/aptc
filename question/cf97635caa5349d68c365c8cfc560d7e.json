  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Dependency Management] Could a compromised or malicious version of the move_vm_types crate be substituted during the build process, allowing an attacker to inject malicious type definitions or VM behaviors that could lead to consensus violations or fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Supply Chain Attack] Is there proper verification of the move_vm_types dependency integrity through cargo lock files and dependency pinning to prevent supply chain attacks that could compromise the VM execution layer? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Version Compatibility] Could a version mismatch between the re-exported move_vm_types and other components using it directly lead to type confusion or ABI incompatibilities causing state corruption or consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Visibility Control] Does the public re-export expose internal move_vm_types APIs that should remain private, potentially allowing native functions to bypass safety checks or access unauthorized VM internals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Transitive Dependencies] Are transitive dependencies brought in through move_vm_types properly audited for security vulnerabilities that could affect native function execution and gas metering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [API Surface] Does this re-export unnecessarily expand the API surface available to native function implementations, potentially exposing dangerous VM internals that could be misused? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Build System] Could build system configuration errors cause this re-export to point to a different version of move_vm_types than intended, leading to runtime type system violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/reexports.rs] [Documentation] Is the security boundary between native functions and Move VM internals clearly documented given this re-export, or could developers accidentally violate VM safety invariants? (Low)"
