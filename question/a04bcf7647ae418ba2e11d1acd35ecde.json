  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Integration: API] [Event filtering] If clients query NewBlockEvents by epoch/round, can malformed query parameters cause database scans over billions of events? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Derive: Clone] [Deep clone cost] If NewBlockEvent contains large Vec<u8> bitvec, can excessive cloning during consensus cause performance degradation or memory pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Derive: Serialize/Deserialize] [Serde format mismatch] If Serde is used instead of BCS in some paths, can format incompatibility cause NewBlockEvent to deserialize with different field values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Derive: Debug] [Information leakage] Can Debug formatting of NewBlockEvent leak sensitive validator information (proposer addresses, voting patterns) in logs accessible to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: epoch] [Epoch=0 handling] Can NewBlockEvent with epoch=0 be created during genesis, and if so, does all consensus code handle epoch=0 correctly without underflow in epoch-1 calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: round] [Round=MAX_U64] If round reaches u64::MAX, can round+1 overflow in consensus causing round counter to wrap to 0 and breaking round ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: height] [Height increment] Is height always height_previous + 1? Can skipped blocks cause height jumps breaking the invariant that event_count=height? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: height] [Height=0] Can height=0 NewBlockEvent exist, and does code handle height=0 correctly in array indexing (height-1) operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Timestamp overflow] If timestamp + epoch_interval overflows u64, can this break epoch transition detection in block.move causing perpetual epoch? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Timestamp=0] Can timestamp=0 be used to represent genesis block, and does this break time-delta calculations elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: previous_block_votes_bitvec] [Bitvec length mismatch] If bitvec length != ceil(validator_count / 8), can this cause buffer overflow when converting to BitVec in consensus? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: previous_block_votes_bitvec] [Empty bitvec] Can previous_block_votes_bitvec be empty Vec when votes should exist, causing quorum validation to incorrectly pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: previous_block_votes_bitvec] [All zeros bitvec] Can all-zero bitvec (no votes) be accepted, implying 0 validators voted, violating quorum requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: previous_block_votes_bitvec] [All ones bitvec] Can all-ones bitvec (100% votes) be forged to fake unanimous consensus when some validators didn't vote? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: previous_block_votes_bitvec] [Padding bits] In the last byte of bitvec, if unused padding bits are set, can this be misinterpreted as extra votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: failed_proposer_indices] [Negative indices] Since u64 is unsigned, can overflow/underflow in index calculations cause wrap-around to MAX_U64 appearing as huge validator index? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: failed_proposer_indices] [Duplicate indices] Can failed_proposer_indices contain duplicates [5,5,5], causing update_performance_statistics to triple-penalize a single validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: failed_proposer_indices] [Unsorted indices] Does code assume failed_proposer_indices is sorted? Can unsorted order cause incorrect processing in reputation calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: failed_proposer_indices] [Self-incrimination] Can current proposer include their own index in failed_proposer_indices to manipulate their reputation score? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: failed_proposer_indices] [Historical accuracy] Are failed_proposer_indices verified against actual missed rounds, or can proposer fabricate arbitrary failure history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: hash] [Hash preimage] Since hash is AccountAddress not HashValue, can preimage attacks find different block contents hashing to same address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: hash] [Hash verification] Is NewBlockEvent.hash verified against actual block.hash() when event is emitted, or can proposer set arbitrary hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: hash] [Hash format] Why is hash stored as AccountAddress (meant for accounts) rather than proper HashValue type? Can this cause type confusion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/new_block.rs] [Field: hash] [Zero hash] Can hash be set to @0x0, and if so, does this break hash-based block lookup in storage? (High)",
