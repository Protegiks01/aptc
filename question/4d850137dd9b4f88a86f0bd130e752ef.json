  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a configuration with minimum_peers_inbound or minimum_peers_outbound set to u64::MAX, causing integer overflow when comparing with actual connection counts and bypassing validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Deserialization Attack] Can a malicious configuration with extremely large u64 values for minimum_peers_inbound (e.g., 2^63) cause panic or undefined behavior during deserialization, potentially crashing the node checker service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: default_minimum_peers_inbound()] [Logic Bypass] Does setting minimum_peers_inbound to 0 by default allow nodes with zero inbound connections to pass validation, enabling eclipse attacks where a node is isolated from the network but appears healthy? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: default_minimum_peers_outbound()] [Inadequate Default] Is the default minimum_peers_outbound value of 1 sufficient to prevent sybil attacks, or can an attacker control that single outbound connection to feed the node malicious state data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Serde Denial Unknown Fields] Does the #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] attribute prevent all deserialization attacks, or can attackers craft JSON with valid field names but invalid types to cause panics during deserialization? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Struct: MinimumPeersCheckerConfig] [Configuration Tampering] Can an attacker who gains write access to the configuration file set minimum_peers_inbound and minimum_peers_outbound to 0, causing all nodes to pass validation even when completely isolated from the network? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Integer Comparison Bypass] In the comparison 'connections >= minimum', can integer overflow occur if connections is near u64::MAX, causing the comparison to incorrectly evaluate and pass validation for disconnected nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Score Manipulation] Does the hardcoded score of 100 for sufficient connections and 50 for insufficient connections allow attackers to game aggregate scoring systems that rely on these values for node reputation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Information Disclosure] Does the detailed explanation string expose internal network topology information (number of connections, peer IPs) that could be used by attackers to map the network and plan targeted attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Hardcoded URL] Does the hardcoded link 'https://aptos.dev/issues-and-workarounds/' in the failure case create a dependency on external infrastructure that could be compromised to redirect users to malicious sites? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Edge Case] When connections equals minimum exactly, does the >= comparison handle the boundary condition correctly, or could floating point precision issues from metric conversion cause intermittent failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: build_evaluation()] [Logic Error] Does the function properly handle the case where minimum is 0, potentially causing division-by-zero errors in downstream percentage calculations or always returning success? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Async Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to check() on the same MinimumPeersChecker instance cause race conditions in accessing the providers.target_metrics_provider, leading to inconsistent validation results? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Provider Manipulation] If an attacker controls the target_metrics_provider, can they return crafted Scrape data with manipulated connection counts to make a poorly-connected node appear well-connected and pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Error Handling Bypass] When target_metrics_provider.provide() fails, does returning a CheckResult with score 0 allow attackers to trigger false negatives by causing provider errors, hiding actual connectivity issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Missing Validation] Does the function validate that providers.target_metrics_provider is not None before dereferencing, or can a None value cause a panic that crashes the checker service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Metric Parsing Failure] When get_metrics() returns Err(evaluation_results), are all error cases properly handled, or can malformed metric data cause the function to return success when it should fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Result Vector Ordering] Does the function guarantee that the inbound check result is always at index 0 and outbound at index 1 in the returned Vec, or can inconsistent ordering cause consumers to misinterpret the results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Double Evaluation] Can attackers exploit the fact that both inbound and outbound evaluations are included in the result vector to influence aggregate scores by triggering the checker multiple times? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Cache Poisoning] Does the underlying MetricsProvider's output_cache allow attackers to poison the cache with stale or malicious metric data that persists across multiple check() calls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Timeout Handling] Does the async check() function implement proper timeouts for the provider.provide() call, or can a slow/hanging provider cause the checker to block indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: check()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by triggering many concurrent check() calls that each allocate large Scrape objects from the metrics provider? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Label Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious labels into the metrics data that match INBOUND_LABEL or OUTBOUND_LABEL patterns, causing get_metric() to return incorrect connection counts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Missing Metric Ambiguity] When both inbound and outbound metrics are missing, does returning Err(evaluation_results) with two separate error results allow consumers to distinguish between partial and total metric failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/checker/minimum_peers.rs] [Function: get_metrics()] [Tuple Destructuring Race] Does the tuple destructuring of (inbound, outbound) from get_metric() calls handle the case where only one metric is present, potentially causing partial data to be used? (Medium)"
