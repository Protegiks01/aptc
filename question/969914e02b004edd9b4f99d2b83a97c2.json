  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Generic: Validate Trait] [Trait Misuse] Can an attacker implement Validate for a type that doesn't satisfy the trait contract, causing undefined behavior when used with Validatable wrapper? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Generic: Type Confusion] [Type Safety] Can an attacker exploit generic type parameters to confuse Validatable<Ed25519PublicKey> with other key types, causing signature verification to use wrong algorithm? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Network: Deserialization Bomb] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker send carefully crafted serialized Validatable instances that explode in size during deserialization, consuming all available memory? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Network: Serialization Format] [Protocol Confusion] Can attackers exploit differences between human-readable (JSON) and binary (BCS) serialization formats to inject keys that serialize differently causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Persistence: State Corruption] [Storage Attack] If Validatable instances are persisted to disk and loaded later, can attackers exploit stale validation state where keys were valid at storage time but invalid at load time? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Performance: Validation Cost] [CPU Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit transactions with many unvalidated keys that trigger expensive validation operations during block execution, causing validator timeout? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Performance: Cache Poisoning] [OnceCell Cache] Can an attacker poison the OnceCell cache with barely-valid keys that pass validation but cause subsequent operations to be extremely slow? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Crypto: Batch Verification] [Validation Bypass] If batch signature verification is used with Validatable keys, can an attacker exploit the deferred validation pattern to include invalid keys that break batch verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Crypto: Key Reuse] [Nonce Management] Does the validation pattern prevent validators from reusing the same Ed25519 key in multiple contexts where nonce/domain separation is required? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-examples/diem-framework/crates/crypto/src/validatable.rs] [Crypto: Side Channel] [Timing Attack] Does validation of Ed25519 keys run in constant time, or can attackers use timing differences to extract information about valid vs invalid keys? (High)"
