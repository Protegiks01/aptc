  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/player.rs] [Struct: Player] [Share index confusion] In Shamir secret sharing where Player ID maps to polynomial evaluation points, can direct Player construction with arbitrary IDs cause evaluation at incorrect points, breaking threshold security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/player.rs] [Struct: Player] [Lagrange interpolation attack] Can invalid Player IDs cause Lagrange basis polynomial calculations to use wrong interpolation points during secret reconstruction, allowing reconstruction with maliciously chosen share combinations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/player.rs] [Struct: Player] [Type confusion] Since Player is a simple wrapper around usize, can it be confused with other usize-based types (like share indices or epoch numbers) in function calls, causing silent misuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/player.rs] [Struct: Player] [Immutability assumption] Does code assume Players are immutable after creation, but the public id field allows mutation, causing time-of-check-time-of-use bugs in transcript verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/player.rs] [TODO comment] [Unimplemented security] The TODO comment explicitly states that enforcement of valid player IDs cannot be fully achieved without module-level restrictions - does this mean the entire type-safety mechanism is bypassable in production? (Critical)"
