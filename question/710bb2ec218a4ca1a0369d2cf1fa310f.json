  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Metric Injection] In line 57, the endpoint name is directly used in metrics - can an attacker inject malicious endpoint names to corrupt Prometheus metrics or cause metric explosion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Throughput Counter] In line 72, THROUGHPUT_COUNTER increments with bytes.len() - can extremely large responses cause the counter to overflow, wrapping around and showing incorrect throughput metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Timer Metric] In line 57, if the timer isn't properly dropped on error paths, can this cause metric leaks that gradually exhaust memory over time? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Metric Label Cardinality] Can attackers craft many unique endpoint variations to explode the cardinality of the timer metric, overwhelming the metrics system and causing monitoring failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Stream Error Handling] In lines 70-76, if bytes_stream() encounters an error mid-stream, is the error properly propagated or could partial corrupted data be returned to callers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Chunk Boundary] The bytes_stream() may split data at arbitrary byte boundaries - can this cause BCS deserialization to fail if multi-byte structures are split across chunks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Stream Completion] Is there validation that the stream completed successfully and all expected data was received, or can a truncated stream be treated as a valid complete response? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Async Read Conversion] The conversion from BytesStream to AsyncRead in lines 76-77 - can errors be lost during this conversion, causing invalid data to appear valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get()] [Pinned Reader] The Box::pin() in line 84 - is the pinned reader properly dropped on all error paths, or can this lead to memory leaks in long-running validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Chunk Overlap] Can an attacker request overlapping chunk ranges (e.g., start_idx=100, limit=100, then start_idx=150, limit=100) to cause duplicate state entries and backup corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Chunk Gap] If chunks are requested with gaps (e.g., 0-100, 200-300, skipping 100-200), can this create incomplete state snapshots that appear valid but are missing critical data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Chunk Order] Does the client enforce that chunks must be retrieved in order, or can out-of-order chunks create state inconsistencies when reassembled? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Version Consistency] If multiple chunks are requested for the same version, can the backup service return chunks from different actual state versions if the state was updated between requests? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_state_snapshot_chunk()] [Zero Limit] What happens if limit=0 is specified - does this return empty data, cause a panic, or enter an infinite loop in the backup service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Transaction Omission] Can a malicious backup service omit specific transactions from the returned stream, allowing validators to restore to a state missing critical transactions like governance updates or token transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Transaction Reordering] Can transactions be returned in a different order than they appeared on-chain, causing restored validators to compute different state roots and fork from the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Transaction Duplication] Can the backup service return duplicate transactions in the stream, causing validators to process transactions twice and diverge from consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Zero Transactions] What happens if num_transactions=0 - does this cause unexpected behavior, infinite loops, or could it be used to probe for the existence of specific version numbers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_transactions()] [Transaction Boundaries] If num_transactions doesn't align with block boundaries, can this cause partial blocks to be backed up, breaking block structure assumptions on restore? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/backup_service_client.rs] [Function: get_epoch_ending_ledger_infos()] [Epoch Skip] Can the backup service omit specific epochs from the returned stream, causing validators to have gaps in their epoch history and potentially reject valid epoch changes?
