  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [VM Integration] [Bypass mechanism] Can an attacker craft a transaction whose script hash accidentally matches an approved hash for a completely different proposal, bypassing mempool limits maliciously? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [VM Integration] [Cache invalidation] If the ApprovedExecutionHashes config is updated mid-block, can cached values in the VM cause inconsistent validation across transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [VM Integration] [Parallel execution] In Block-STM parallel execution, can concurrent reads of this config lead to race conditions where some transactions see old hashes? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Governance Integration] [Execution order] If multiple proposals add hashes simultaneously, can non-deterministic ordering cause consensus disagreements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [State Consistency] [Cross-language sync] Since Move uses SimpleMap and Rust uses Vec, can deserialization inconsistencies cause different nodes to have different views? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [State Consistency] [Atomic updates] Are updates to this config atomic at the block level, or can partial updates cause inconsistent state during epoch transitions? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Hash algorithm] What hash algorithm is used for Vec<u8>, and can preimage or collision attacks find malicious scripts with matching hashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/approved_execution_hashes.rs] [Field: entries] [Hash length] Are hash lengths validated, or can short hashes (e.g., 1 byte) increase collision probability exponentially? (High)",
