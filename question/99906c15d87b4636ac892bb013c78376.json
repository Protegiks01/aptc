  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [ChainId validation] Does the chain_id.is_mainnet() check at line 69 correctly identify all mainnet variants, or can attackers use custom ChainId values that claim to be mainnet but bypass is_mainnet()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [ChainId fallback] When chain_id is None at line 95-98, optimize() disables admin service, but does this create a situation where nodes without proper chain_id configuration silently lose admin functionality? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Testnet risk] Does the optimize() logic at line 96 that enables admin service by default on testnet (!chain_id.is_mainnet()) create security risks if testnet nodes handle real value or are used in security-critical testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [Error handling] Can the sanitize() error at lines 72-75 be caught and ignored by calling code, allowing nodes to start with invalid admin service configurations on mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Struct: AdminServiceConfig] [Race condition] Since AdminServiceConfig implements Clone at line 15, can multiple threads clone and modify the config simultaneously, leading to race conditions where authentication_configs are cleared after sanitization?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: sanitize()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between when sanitize() validates authentication_configs at line 70 and when the admin service actually starts using the config? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Function: optimize()] [Concurrent modification] Can optimize() and sanitize() be called concurrently on the same NodeConfig, causing one to overwrite the other's changes and resulting in invalid configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: enabled] [State inconsistency] Can the Option<bool> enabled field at line 18 transition between None, Some(true), and Some(false) in a way that creates race conditions where the service state is inconsistent with the config? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration] [Privilege escalation] Can an attacker with access to /malloc/dump_profile, /debug/consensus/consensusdb, or /debug/mempool endpoints (which rely on this config) extract sensitive validator keys, consensus state, or transaction data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Integration] [Information disclosure] Do endpoints like /profilez and /threadz (CPU profiling and thread dumps) expose sensitive information about validator consensus timing, potentially enabling targeted attacks on consensus?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Enum: AuthenticationConfig] [Timing attack] Does the PasscodeSha256 comparison in the admin service use constant-time comparison, or can attackers use timing attacks to brute-force passcode hashes by measuring response times? (High)",
