  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Struct: SizedCircuit] [Generic field] SizedCircuit is generic over Field F, but benchmarks only use ark_bn254::Fr - could type confusion occur if other field types are used? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: random_128bit_witness()] [Generic constraints] The function is generic over F: Field - are there field types where u128 conversion could fail or produce unexpected results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Groth16 compliance] Does the circuit structure comply with all Groth16 protocol requirements, or could protocol violations in benchmarks propagate to production implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Keyless relation accuracy] The comment claims these dimensions target the Keyless NP relation - is this claim verified, or could dimension mismatches cause real Keyless proofs to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: setup_bn254_pk()] [CRS security] The Common Reference String (CRS) generated by setup is used for all benchmarks - does this simulate real-world CRS generation security properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Production usage risk] Could developers mistakenly copy benchmark code patterns (like dummy constraints or weak RNG) into production Keyless implementations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Parameter consistency] Are the circuit dimensions consistent with other Keyless-related code in the aptos-crypto crate, or could inconsistencies cause integration failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Library version] The benchmark depends on specific versions of ark_groth16, ark_bn254, etc. - could version mismatches introduce security regressions in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: setup_bn254_pk()] [TODO comment] The TODO about h_query length indicates incomplete understanding - should this be resolved before benchmark results inform production decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Documentation] The benchmark lacks documentation explaining how results should be interpreted for Keyless security analysis - could this lead to misuse? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Test coverage] Are there unit tests validating that benchmark circuits actually produce valid proofs that verify correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [BN254 security margin] BN254 provides approximately 100-bit security against known attacks - is this sufficient for Aptos's long-term security requirements given advances in discrete log attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Function: setup_bn254_pk()] [Toxic waste] In a trusted setup, the random values used must be destroyed ('toxic waste') - does the benchmark properly demonstrate secure setup practices? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Proof malleability] Groth16 proofs can be malleable - does the benchmark verify non-malleability properties required for blockchain usage? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_groth16.rs] [Overall] [Subgroup security] Does the BN254 curve implementation properly validate that elements are in the correct subgroup to prevent small-subgroup attacks? (High)"
