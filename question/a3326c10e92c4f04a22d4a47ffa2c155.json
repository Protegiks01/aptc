(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/create_resource_account.rs] [Integration: account.move, Line 447] [Permission check bypass] Does rotate_authentication_key_internal() properly check permissions through check_rotation_permission(), or can resource account creation bypass these checks? (High)",
