(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/create_resource_account.rs] [Integration: Container resource] [SimpleMap key collision] The Container uses address as key - can hash collisions or address derivation bugs allow an attacker to overwrite another user's SignerCapability in the map?
