  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker craft a malicious StateSnapshotChunk with first_idx > last_idx causing integer underflow when calculating chunk size (last_idx - first_idx + 1), potentially bypassing size limits or causing panics during validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [Integer Overflow] Can first_idx or last_idx be set to usize::MAX causing arithmetic overflow when incrementing indices during chunk processing, potentially skipping validation logic or corrupting state indices? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotChunk] [File Handle Manipulation] If the blobs FileHandle references a maliciously large file (e.g., petabytes), can this cause memory exhaustion during deserialization before size validation occurs?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Root Hash Forgery] Can an attacker craft a StateSnapshotBackup where root_hash doesn't match the actual state root but still passes verification due to missing validation between manifest root_hash and proof root_hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/backup_types/state_snapshot/manifest.rs] [Struct: StateSnapshotBackup] [Chunk Gap Attack] Can the chunks Vec contain gaps in the index ranges (e.g., chunk1: 0-99, chunk2: 200-299) causing accounts 100-199 to be missing from restored state without detection?
