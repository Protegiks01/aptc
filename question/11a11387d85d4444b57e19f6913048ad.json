  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/mod.rs] [Module: Re-exports] [Visibility Control] Can an attacker exploit the public re-export structure to access internal filter implementations that should be private, potentially bypassing validation logic or accessing unsafe internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/mod.rs] [Module: Re-exports] [API Surface] Does the re-export of all builder types (EventFilterBuilder, MoveStructTagFilterBuilder, etc.) expose construction patterns that could allow creation of invalid filter states that bypass validate_state() checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/mod.rs] [Module: Re-exports] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the re-exported types to cause type confusion between different filter variants, potentially causing incorrect transaction filtering or indexer data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/mod.rs] [Module: Dependencies] [Dependency Chain] Are the dependencies between the re-exported filter modules (event, move_module, transaction_root, user_transaction) properly isolated, or can vulnerabilities in one filter type propagate to others through shared state or unsafe interfaces? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Struct: EventFilter] [Input Validation] In the EventFilter struct with data_substring_filter and struct_type fields, can an attacker provide an extremely large substring filter string to cause memory exhaustion during OnceCell initialization of the Finder, leading to indexer DoS? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: validate_state()] [Validation Bypass] The validate_state() function checks if both data_substring_filter and struct_type are None, but can an attacker provide empty strings or invalid MoveStructTagFilter to bypass this validation while still creating a useless filter that wastes resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: matches()] [Race Condition] The matches() function uses OnceCell::get_or_init() for lazy initialization of the Finder. Can concurrent calls to matches() from multiple threads cause a race condition where the Finder is initialized multiple times or with inconsistent data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: matches()] [ReDoS Attack] The data_substring_finder using memchr::memmem::Finder processes untrusted event data. Can an attacker craft malicious event data with specific byte patterns that cause catastrophic backtracking or excessive memory consumption in the substring search? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: matches()] [Type Confusion] When extracting struct_tag from item.r#type.content, if the Content enum variant doesn't match Struct, the function returns false. Can an attacker craft events with malformed or unexpected Content variants to bypass filtering or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: matches()] [Memory Safety] The finder.find(item.data.as_bytes()) call operates on untrusted event data. Can oversized or malformed event data cause buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption in the underlying memchr implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Trait: From<proto>] [Deserialization] The From<aptos_protos::indexer::v1::EventFilter> implementation doesn't validate the proto_filter fields. Can an attacker provide malicious protobuf data with null pointers, invalid UTF-8, or corrupted struct_type to cause crashes or undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Struct: EventFilter] [Clone Safety] EventFilter derives Clone with OnceCell containing a Finder. Does cloning create shared references to the same Finder instance, potentially causing data races when multiple clones call matches() concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Function: matches()] [Short-circuit Logic] The matches() function checks struct_type first, then data_substring_filter. Can an attacker exploit this ordering by crafting events that match the struct type but have malicious data, bypassing the substring filter check if the function returns early? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: standardize_address()] [Address Normalization] The get_standardized_address() uses OnceCell memoization with standardize_address(). Can an attacker provide addresses with different representations (with/without 0x, different padding) that hash to the same OnceCell but represent different addresses, causing filter bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: validate_state()] [Validation Logic] The validate_state() only checks if all three fields (address, module, name) are None. Can an attacker provide empty strings for all fields to bypass validation while creating a filter that matches everything, causing performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: matches()] [Logic Error] The matches() function uses && to combine address, module, and name checks. If any field is None (via matches_opt()), it returns true. Can this allow an attacker to bypass filtering by providing partial matches when full validation was intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Trait: From<proto>] [Initialization Race] The From implementation initializes standardized_address with OnceCell::with_value(). Can concurrent proto conversions cause race conditions where the OnceCell is in an inconsistent state during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: matches()] [Case Sensitivity] The module and name matching uses direct string comparison via matches_opt(). Are Move module names case-sensitive? Can an attacker bypass filters using case variations (e.g., 'Coin' vs 'coin')? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Struct: MoveStructTagFilter] [Unicode Handling] Module and name fields are String types that could contain Unicode. Can an attacker use Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., ΑΒΓ vs ABΓ in Greek/Latin) to bypass filters matching on ASCII representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: get_standardized_address()] [Memory Leak] The OnceCell memoization permanently caches the standardized address. In long-running indexer services processing millions of unique addresses, can this cause unbounded memory growth leading to OOM conditions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Function: matches()] [Injection Attack] The standardize_address() is called on untrusted struct_tag.address data. Can specially crafted addresses with control characters, null bytes, or escape sequences cause issues in downstream string processing or logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Function: validate_state()] [Validation Logic] The validate_state() requires at least one of success or txn_type to be set. Can an attacker provide both as Some() with contradictory values (e.g., success=true with BlockMetadata type that shouldn't have success) to cause filter inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Function: matches()] [Panic Risk] The matches() function calls TransactionType::try_from(item.r#type).expect(\\",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Function: matches()] [Null Pointer] The success check accesses item.info.as_ref().map(|i| i.success). If item.info is None for certain transaction types, does matches_opt() handle this correctly, or can this cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)"
