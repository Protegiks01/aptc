  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Struct: AptosTransactionOutput] [Race condition] Can concurrent threads access the OnceCell committed_output simultaneously during materialization, leading to race conditions where one thread reads incomplete state while another writes, potentially causing state inconsistency across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: take_output()] [Double consumption] Can an attacker trigger take_output() twice on the same AptosTransactionOutput by exploiting thread scheduling, causing a panic on the second expect() call and crashing validator nodes during block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: take_output()] [State transition violation] If committed_output is None but vm_output is also None after a failed materialization, can this lead to a panic that halts block execution and causes loss of liveness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization bypass] Can an attacker construct AptosTransactionOutput with a malicious VMOutput that bypasses gas metering or validation checks during the new() initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: take_output()] [Transaction output manipulation] Can the fallback path in take_output() that uses vm_output.into_transaction_output() be exploited to include un-materialized state, leading to incorrect state commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: fee_statement()] [Fee manipulation] Can an attacker craft transactions where try_extract_fee_statement() returns Ok(None), causing FeeStatement::zero() to be returned and bypassing actual gas charges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: has_new_epoch_event()] [Epoch transition bypass] Can malicious validators inject fake epoch events in the output that pass has_new_epoch_event() check but don't trigger proper validator set updates, causing network partition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Struct: AfterMaterializationGuard] [Lifetime safety] Can the reference lifetime in AfterMaterializationGuard be violated if the underlying TransactionOutput is moved or dropped while the guard is still in use? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: fee_statement()] [Fee extraction inconsistency] Can the fee_statement returned before materialization differ from after materialization, allowing attackers to commit transactions with lower fees than validated? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/block_executor/mod.rs] [Function: output_approx_size()] [Size calculation bypass] Can materialized_size() underestimate the actual output size, allowing attackers to exceed block limits and cause memory exhaustion on validator nodes? (High)",
