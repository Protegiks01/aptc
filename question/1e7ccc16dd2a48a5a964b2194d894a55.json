  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker supply a malicious output_path like '../../../etc/passwd' or '/etc/shadow' to overwrite critical system files when the write() function is called with user-controlled paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Path Traversal] Does the write() method validate that output_path doesn't contain directory traversal sequences like '..', './', or absolute paths that could escape intended output directories and overwrite validator configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Path Validation] Is there any sanitization or canonicalization of the output_path field before it's used in std::fs::write(), or can attackers use encoded traversal sequences like '%2e%2e%2f' to bypass basic filters? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Symlink Attack] If output_path points to a symbolic link, does std::fs::write() follow the symlink, potentially allowing an attacker to create a symlink pointing to /var/lib/aptos/config.yaml and overwrite validator configuration when the tool runs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [File Overwrite] Does write() check if the target file already exists and validate permissions before overwriting, or can it silently overwrite critical node-checker baseline configuration files causing validator health check failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Directory Creation] If output_path specifies a file in a non-existent directory like '/tmp/nonexistent/output.yaml', does std::fs::write() fail safely or could this cause panic/crash in production node-checker deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Absolute Path Bypass] Can an attacker specify an absolute path like '/root/.ssh/authorized_keys' as output_path to write arbitrary content to system-critical locations when node-checker runs with elevated privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Path Length] Is there validation on the length of output_path to prevent buffer overflow attacks or filesystem path length limits (4096 bytes on Linux) that could cause truncation and write to unintended locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Null Byte Injection] Can output_path contain null bytes ('\\0') that could truncate the path in underlying C FFI calls, causing the file to be written to a different location than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Special Characters] Are special characters in output_path like newlines, tabs, or control characters properly validated to prevent filesystem manipulation or log injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [TOCTOU Race] Is there a race condition between when output_path is validated (if at all) and when std::fs::write() is called, allowing an attacker to swap a legitimate file with a symlink to critical validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Concurrent Writes] If multiple node-checker instances run simultaneously with the same output_path, can this cause file corruption, partial writes, or race conditions that lead to malformed OpenAPI specs being served? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Atomic Writes] Does std::fs::write() perform atomic writes, or can partial writes occur if the process crashes mid-write, potentially corrupting node-checker configuration files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Permission Check] Does write() verify the process has write permissions to the target path before attempting to write, or does it rely on std::fs::write() error handling which might fail silently in some scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Umask Bypass] What file permissions are set when creating new files through std::fs::write()? Can an attacker exploit weak default permissions (e.g., world-writable) to modify node-checker output files after creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Privilege Escalation] If node-checker runs with elevated privileges (root/sudo), can output_path be exploited to write files with elevated permissions, potentially creating setuid binaries or modifying system configs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Struct: OutputArgs] [Cross-User Access] In multi-user systems, can one user specify output_path in another user's home directory to leak sensitive node-checker results or overwrite their configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Is there any size limit on the output string before writing? Can an attacker cause the write() function to fill up disk space by generating massive OpenAPI specs, causing validator node failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Memory Exhaustion] Does write() handle extremely large output strings efficiently, or can passing gigabytes of data in the output parameter cause memory exhaustion and node-checker crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Infinite Loop] Can maliciously crafted output_path values (e.g., device files like /dev/random) cause write() to hang indefinitely, blocking node-checker execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Device File Write] Can output_path point to special device files like /dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/urandom causing unexpected behavior or resource consumption when std::fs::write() attempts to write to them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Enum: OutputFormat] [Format Mismatch] If format is set to OutputFormat::Json but the output string contains YAML, can this cause parsing errors or security issues in downstream consumers expecting valid JSON? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Output Injection] Is the output parameter sanitized before writing? Can an attacker inject malicious YAML/JSON directives (like YAML anchors/aliases) to cause denial of service or code execution in parsers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Enum: OutputFormat] [Case Sensitivity] The value_enum has ignore_case = true - can this lead to format confusion if attackers supply mixed-case values that are interpreted differently by downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/common/common_args.rs] [Function: write()] [Encoding Issues] Does write() handle non-UTF8 sequences in the output string properly, or can invalid UTF8 cause panics or data corruption when writing to files? (Low)"
