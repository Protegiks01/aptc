  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [Key Encoding Detection] If from_encoded_string() auto-detects encoding (hex vs base64), can attackers craft ambiguous strings that decode differently on different implementations, causing key mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Partial Success Handling] If try_into() fails for some entries but succeeds for others from the same account, is the partial success state properly represented, or could this cause confusion in node registration? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Error State Pollution] Can invalid entries with error messages in invalid_node_address_results affect the processing of valid entries, causing incorrect validation decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Allowlist State] Is the account_address_allowlist parameter validated before use, or can an empty/malformed allowlist cause all entries to be processed or all rejected unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Empty File Handling] What happens if the input_file is empty or contains an empty JSON array []? Does this return empty HashMaps or cause an error, and could this be exploited for bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Duplicate Detection] Can identical entries (same account_address, url, ports, public_key) be registered multiple times, wasting resources or enabling amplification attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Struct: Entry] [Field Overflow] Beyond port numbers being u16, are there other numeric fields that could overflow during JSON parsing or arithmetic operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Impl: TryInto<NodeInfo>] [URL Mutation] After Url::parse() creates the node_url, can the URL be mutated before storage in NodeInfo, potentially changing its meaning or bypassing validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/fn-check-client/src/get_pfns.rs] [Function: get_node_infos()] [Memory Fragmentation] Can the pattern of HashMap insertions and Vec allocations cause memory fragmentation over time, leading to increased memory usage or allocation failures? (Low)"
