  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: InternalIndexerMetadataSchema] [State Divergence] Can InternalIndexerMetadataSchema and IndexerMetadataSchema store conflicting metadata for the same keys, causing the internal indexer and legacy indexer to have divergent views of indexing progress and break API consistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: InternalIndexerMetadataSchema] [Column Family Isolation] Does INTERNAL_INDEXER_METADATA_CF_NAME provide proper isolation from other column families, or could bugs in RocksDB configuration allow metadata corruption to spread to other critical storage components? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: InternalIndexerMetadataSchema] [Restore Failure] During state snapshot restoration, can corrupted InternalIndexerMetadataSchema entries cause the restoration process to enter infinite loops or deadlocks, preventing nodes from ever completing sync? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: InternalIndexerMetadataSchema] [Pruner Deadlock] Can concurrent pruner operations writing to InternalIndexerMetadataSchema create lock contention with indexer writes, causing deadlocks that halt both pruning and indexing operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: InternalIndexerMetadataSchema] [Version Overflow] Does InternalIndexerMetadataSchema properly handle Version numbers approaching u64::MAX, or could version wraparound cause catastrophic failures where newer blocks appear older than ancient blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataKey] [Key Collision] Can different MetadataKey enum variants produce identical BCS-encoded byte sequences, causing key collisions in the database where EventVersion and StateVersion overwrite each other's metadata? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataKey] [Enum Expansion] If new MetadataKey variants are added in future versions, could nodes running old code crash when encountering unknown key types during database iteration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataKey] [Progress Tracking] Can malicious updates to EventPrunerProgress or TransactionPrunerProgress keys trick the system into believing pruning has advanced further than reality, causing premature deletion of events and transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataKey] [Version Parameter] For StateSnapshotRestoreProgress(Version), can extremely large Version values cause integer overflow when used as database keys, leading to undefined behavior in key comparison and iteration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataKey] [Missing Validation] Are MetadataKey variants validated before database writes, or could an attacker inject keys with invalid internal state (e.g., StateSnapshotRestoreProgress with Version 0) that break snapshot restoration logic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataValue] [Type Safety] Does the expect_version() method properly panic with safe error messages, or could panics during metadata access leave the database in inconsistent states with uncommitted transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataValue] [Version Monotonicity] Can Version values stored in MetadataValue decrease due to bugs or attacks, causing the indexer to roll back progress and re-index already processed transactions, potentially corrupting indexed data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataValue] [Progress Inconsistency] Can StateSnapshotProgress contain inconsistent key_hash and usage values, causing snapshot verification to fail and preventing nodes from completing state synchronization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataValue] [Panic Safety] Does expect_state_snapshot_progress() provide proper error context in its panic messages, or could cryptic panics make debugging impossible when snapshot restoration encounters unexpected metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: MetadataValue] [Value Validation] Are MetadataValue enum variants validated for consistency before storage, or could an attacker store Version(u64::MAX) causing all subsequent version comparisons to behave incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: StateSnapshotProgress] [Hash Verification] Does StateSnapshotProgress validate that key_hash actually corresponds to a valid state key, or could fake hashes be stored causing snapshot restoration to access incorrect state data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: StateSnapshotProgress] [Usage Overflow] Can StateStorageUsage values in StateSnapshotProgress overflow or become negative, causing incorrect billing calculations or resource exhaustion during snapshot operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: StateSnapshotProgress] [Progress Ordering] Does the system ensure StateSnapshotProgress records are processed in key_hash order, or could out-of-order processing during restoration cause missed state keys and incomplete snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: StateSnapshotProgress] [Concurrent Updates] Can multiple threads updating StateSnapshotProgress for different versions create race conditions where progress is recorded in the wrong order, breaking restoration checkpointing?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Type: StateSnapshotProgress] [Memory Leak] Does StateSnapshotProgress properly manage memory for the StateStorageUsage structure, or could long-running snapshot restorations accumulate unbounded progress records causing memory exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/indexer_schemas/src/schema/indexer_metadata/mod.rs] [Schema: Both] [Transactional Integrity] Are metadata updates within both IndexerMetadataSchema and InternalIndexerMetadataSchema wrapped in proper database transactions, or could partial commits leave metadata in inconsistent states after node crashes? (Critical)",
