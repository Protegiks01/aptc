  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Test: test_prove_and_verify()] [Verification Bypass] At line 338, does verify_groth16_proof() properly reject proofs with incorrect public inputs, or can similar-looking inputs cause false positives? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: generate_random_scalar()] [Modulo Bias] Does from_random_bytes() with 32-byte input introduce modulo bias when the field order is not a power of 2, weakening randomness quality? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: generate_random_g1_elem()] [Point Distribution] Is the random point sampling uniformly distributed across the curve, or does it favor certain regions enabling statistical attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: create_random_proof_with_trapdoor()] [Entropy Exhaustion] If the RNG has insufficient entropy, can generate_random_scalar() produce predictable or repeated values across multiple proof generations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Struct: Trapdoor] [Trapdoor Extraction] If an attacker obtains multiple valid proofs and the corresponding verifying key, can they perform algebraic attacks to recover the trapdoor scalars? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: circuit_agnostic_setup_with_trapdoor()] [Alpha-Beta Relation] Can the relationship between alpha and beta be exploited if they're generated consecutively with correlated randomness? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: circuit_agnostic_setup_with_trapdoor()] [Delta-Gamma Independence] Are delta and gamma cryptographically independent, or can knowledge of one reveal information about the other through the verifying key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Struct: Trapdoor] [Trapdoor Lifetime] Is there a mechanism to revoke or rotate trapdoors periodically, or do compromised trapdoors allow indefinite proof forgery? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: create_proof_with_trapdoor()] [Input Encoding] Are public inputs properly encoded as field elements, or can different encodings of the same value produce different proofs? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Function: create_proof_with_trapdoor()] [Iterator Bounds] Does the zip iterator at line 159 properly terminate when the shorter sequence is exhausted, or can it cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/keyless/proof_simulation.rs] [Test: test_prove_and_verify()] [BigInt Conversion] At line 205, can BigInt construction from u64 array overflow or produce incorrect field elements for edge case values? (Medium)",
