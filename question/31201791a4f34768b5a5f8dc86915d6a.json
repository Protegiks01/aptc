  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::BatchResponseV2] [Version confusion] Does the system properly distinguish between BatchResponse and BatchResponseV2, or can version mismatches cause validators to misinterpret batch data? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Method: ConsensusMsg::name()] [Message type spoofing] Can an attacker exploit the name() method's string representation to cause confusion in logging or metrics, potentially masking malicious message types? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Method: ConsensusMsg::name()] [Pattern matching exhaustiveness] Are all ConsensusMsg variants properly covered in the name() match statement, or could new variants without name mappings cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Struct: ConsensusNetworkClient] [Clone safety] Is the ConsensusNetworkClient safe to clone across multiple async tasks, or can concurrent clones lead to race conditions in message ordering or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does the new() constructor validate that the provided network_client is properly configured, or can uninitialized/malicious network clients be wrapped causing security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Peer validation] Does send_to() validate that the destination peer is an authorized validator before sending consensus messages, or can messages be sent to arbitrary peers? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Message authentication] Is there cryptographic authentication of messages in send_to() before network transmission, or can an attacker intercept and modify messages in transit? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Error handling] Does send_to() properly propagate network errors, or can failed message deliveries be silently ignored causing consensus liveness issues? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to()] [Rate limiting] Is there any rate limiting in send_to() to prevent a malicious validator from flooding the network with consensus messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Peer list validation] Does send_to_many() validate that all peers in the list are authorized validators, or can an attacker include unauthorized peers to leak consensus information? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Atomic delivery] If send_to_many() fails for some peers, does it ensure atomic delivery semantics, or can partial message delivery cause consensus inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Message duplication] Can send_to_many() send duplicate messages to the same peer if the peers vector contains duplicates, potentially causing double-processing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_to_many()] [Empty peer list] Does send_to_many() handle the case where peers vector is empty, or can this cause unexpected behavior in consensus protocols expecting message broadcast? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the rpc_timeout parameter to cause either indefinite hangs (large timeout) or premature failures (zero timeout) in critical consensus RPCs? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response validation] Does send_rpc() validate that the response message type matches the expected type for the request, or can Byzantine peers send incorrect response types? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Response authenticity] Is the RPC response cryptographically verified to be from the intended peer, or can a man-in-the-middle attacker forge responses? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Timeout race condition] Can concurrent send_rpc() calls with different timeouts to the same peer cause race conditions in timeout handling, leading to incorrect consensus state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc()] [Error propagation] Are network errors from send_rpc() properly distinguished from protocol-level errors, or can an attacker exploit error confusion to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Raw message validation] Does send_rpc_raw() perform any validation on the raw Bytes before transmission, or can completely malformed data be sent causing peer crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Deserialization safety] When the raw response is received, is deserialization performed safely with bounds checking, or can malicious responses trigger buffer overflows? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Type confusion] Can send_rpc_raw() be exploited to send messages that are interpreted as different ConsensusMsg variants by the receiver, bypassing type safety? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: send_rpc_raw()] [Protocol bypass] Does send_rpc_raw() bypass protocol version checks or message validation that send_rpc() performs, enabling protocol downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol selection] Can an attacker manipulate protocol selection in to_bytes_by_protocol() to force use of insecure or deprecated protocols? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Serialization consistency] Does to_bytes_by_protocol() ensure consistent serialization across all peers, or can different protocol selections cause validators to deserialize messages differently? (High)",
