  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/telemetry_log_sender.rs] [Function: add_to_batch()] [Empty String] What happens if log.len() is 0? Does empty string pass validation at line 40 and get added to batch, wasting space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-telemetry/src/telemetry_log_sender.rs] [Function: add_to_batch()] [Size Comparison] Should line 49 comparison be >= instead of > to enforce strict max_bytes limit? Current logic allows slight overflow. (Medium)",
