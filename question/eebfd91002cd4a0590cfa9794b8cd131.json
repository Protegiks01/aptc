  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestCase] [Argument type confusion] Can the MoveValue arguments mismatch the function signature of the test being called, causing type confusion in the Move VM that could lead to memory corruption or bypass of Move's type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestCase] [Test name collision] The test_name field is a String at line 46 - can duplicate test names within a module cause tests to overwrite each other in the BTreeMap, leading to wrong tests being executed or security tests being skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestCase] [Expected failure bypass] Can an attacker set expected_failure to None for a test that should fail, or set it to Expected to accept any failure, causing vulnerable code to appear tested when security checks are actually bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestCase] [Argument resource exhaustion] Can an attacker provide extremely large Vec<MoveValue> with millions of arguments or deeply nested structures that cause memory exhaustion when cloned or processed during test setup?

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Enum: NamedOrBytecodeModule] [Bytecode validation gap] The Bytecode variant at line 26 stores CompiledModule without source - can bytecode dependencies contain malicious code that isn't subject to the same validation as source-compiled Named modules, creating an attack vector? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Enum: NamedOrBytecodeModule] [Clone safety] Both variants are cloned throughout the code - can cloning CompiledModule bytecode cause deep copies of large bytecode blobs leading to memory exhaustion, or can reference counting issues cause memory safety problems? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Struct: TestPlan] [Hash collision] The module_tests BTreeMap at line 32 uses ModuleId as key - can an attacker craft ModuleIds that cause hash collisions or BTreeMap ordering issues, leading to tests executing against wrong modules?

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/legacy-move-compiler/src/unit_test/mod.rs] [Overall] [Serialization safety] If TestPlan, ModuleTestPlan, or TestCase are serialized/deserialized (for distributed testing or caching), can deserialization of malicious data bypass validation checks and inject malicious modules or tests?
