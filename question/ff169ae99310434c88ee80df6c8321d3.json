  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/docgen.rs] [Function: run()] [Race condition] Does the static MUTEX at line 69 properly prevent race conditions when multiple concurrent docgen processes attempt to change the current directory, or could interleaving allow one process to generate docs in the wrong directory? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/docgen.rs] [Function: run()] [Mutex poisoning] If a panic occurs between acquiring the MUTEX lock and restoring the current directory, could this poison the mutex and prevent all future documentation generation, causing build failures? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/docgen.rs] [Function: run()] [Disk space exhaustion] Can extremely large generated documentation output cause disk space exhaustion when writing files at line 117, and is there any size limit or quota enforcement? (Low)",
