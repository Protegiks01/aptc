  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Error: unwrap_or_else at line 84-89] [Error message DoS] The panic message includes file path and error details - can attackers trigger this repeatedly to fill logs, exhaust disk space, or create log analysis confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Error: unwrap_or_else at line 91-96] [Parse error exploitation] The parsing panic includes content.trim() which could be attacker-controlled - can malicious waypoint content exploit logging systems or cause buffer overflows in panic handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Error: expect at line 101-104] [Storage failure cascade] If the storage backend fails, all validators using FromStorage will panic - can attackers cause storage backend unavailability to trigger coordinated validator crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Error: expect at line 109] [Final validation failure] The final expect('waypoint should be present') suggests defensive programming but can still panic - what scenarios can reach this point despite earlier checks, and can attackers trigger them? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Error: expect at line 117-119] [Genesis storage failure] If GENESIS_WAYPOINT is missing from storage, the node panics during initialization - can attackers corrupt storage to prevent validator startup and cause liveness failure? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Config: Startup validation] [Incomplete checks] Are all BaseConfig fields validated during startup, or can invalid data_dir/working_dir paths cause crashes only after the node has partially initialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Config: Hot reload] [State inconsistency] If BaseConfig can be reloaded without full node restart, can attackers exploit state inconsistencies between old and new configs to cause consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Concurrency: Shared state] [Data race] BaseConfig derives Clone - if cloned configs are modified concurrently, can data races cause inconsistent role, waypoint, or path values across threads? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Integration: NodeConfig coupling] [Validation bypass] The sanitize() function takes &NodeConfig - can attackers craft NodeConfig where base validation passes but other config sections create inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Integration: NodeType parameter] [Type mismatch] The sanitize() function receives NodeType parameter but doesn't validate against BaseConfig.role - can Validator role run on NodeType::FullNode causing privilege confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Integration: ChainId parameter] [Chain confusion] The sanitize() function receives Optional ChainId but doesn't validate waypoint against it - can waypoints from different chains (mainnet, testnet) be used interchangeably causing chain confusion?

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Filesystem: read_to_string] [Encoding attacks] The fs::read_to_string() at line 84 assumes UTF-8 encoding - can non-UTF-8 waypoint files cause panics or bypass validation through encoding exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/base_config.rs] [Filesystem: File permissions] [Unauthorized read] When reading waypoint files, are file permissions checked to ensure only the node user can read them, or can other processes read sensitive waypoint data? (Medium)",
