  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [make_sync Wrapper] Can the make_sync wrapper on line 36 introduce security issues by converting an async endpoint to sync, potentially blocking the event loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Endpoint Trait] Does the Endpoint trait implementation allow for proper error handling and security validation, or can malformed requests bypass security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [poem-openapi Version] The comment on lines 10-12 mentions issues with poem-openapi versions > 2.0.11 - can upgrading this dependency introduce security vulnerabilities through the charset handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [YAML Parsing] When yaml=true on line 19, does service.spec_yaml() produce YAML that is safe from billion laughs attacks, anchor reference loops, or other YAML deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [YAML Injection] Can malicious API definitions be injected into the YAML specification that exploit YAML parsing vulnerabilities in client tools or code generators? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Public Access] Are the JSON spec endpoints meant to be publicly accessible, or should they be behind authentication to prevent reconnaissance by potential attackers? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Authorization Bypass] Can the YAML spec endpoint be accessed without proper authentication, allowing attackers to study the API structure before launching targeted attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Rate Limiting] Is there rate limiting applied to spec endpoint requests to prevent enumeration attacks or resource exhaustion from repeated spec downloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Spec Caching] Is the spec string cached appropriately, or does every request regenerate the entire OpenAPI specification, creating unnecessary computational overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Cache Headers] Does the JSON endpoint include proper cache-control headers to prevent sensitive or outdated spec information from being cached inappropriately? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Error Propagation] If service.spec() or service.spec_yaml() fail or panic on lines 20-23, are errors properly caught and handled, or can they crash the API server? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_json()] [Response Error] What happens if the Response::builder() operations fail on lines 37-39 - are errors properly returned to clients or logged for security monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Header Failure] If setting the Content-Disposition header on line 55 fails, does the endpoint still return a response, potentially with incorrect metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: get_spec()] [Hardcoded String] Is the hardcoded '; charset=utf-8' replacement string on line 24 sufficiently future-proof, or could upstream changes to poem-openapi make this workaround obsolete or problematic? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/spec.rs] [Function: spec_endpoint_yaml()] [Hardcoded Filename] Is the hardcoded 'spec.yaml' filename on line 55 appropriate, or could it conflict with existing files or cause issues with certain client download handlers? (Low)",
