  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Memory exhaustion] Even if Content-Length is validated, can the actual body reading in self.inner.call() allocate unbounded memory if the framework doesn't enforce the limit during reading? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Struct: PostSizeLimitEndpoint] [Clone safety] If Request is cloned or moved during processing, does the size validation still apply to all copies, or can cloned requests bypass the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimit::new()] [Invalid configuration] What happens if PostSizeLimit::new() is called with max_size = 0 or max_size = 1? Can this create denial-of-service conditions by rejecting all valid POST requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimit::new()] [Configuration overflow] If max_size is configured from an external source (config file, environment variable), is there proper validation to prevent u64 overflow or extremely large values? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Chunked encoding] Does the middleware handle Transfer-Encoding: chunked correctly? Can attackers send chunked requests without Content-Length to bypass size validation entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Mixed encoding] Can attackers use both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers simultaneously to exploit HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities between the size check and body processing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Chunk size limits] If chunked encoding is supported, does each chunk get validated against the size limit, or only the total size? Can attackers send many small chunks that sum to oversized payloads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [HTTP/2 frames] In HTTP/2, does the size limit apply per frame or per full request? Can attackers split oversized payloads across multiple DATA frames to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [HTTP/1.1 pipelining] Can attackers use HTTP pipelining to send multiple POST requests in a single connection where size validation gets confused about request boundaries? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Transaction submission] For transaction submission endpoints, can attackers craft transactions with bloated witness data or signature fields that pass size validation but consume excessive resources during verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [Module publication] If Move module publication uses POST, can attackers submit modules just under the size limit with extremely complex bytecode that causes excessive compilation or verification time? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Struct: PostSizeLimitEndpoint] [u64 precision] Does the u64 type for max_size have sufficient precision for all use cases, or can loss of precision in conversions lead to incorrect size validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [ContentLength.0 field] Is the ContentLength.0 field access safe? Can malformed ContentLength structs cause panics or unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/src/check_size.rs] [Function: PostSizeLimitEndpoint::call()] [OPTIONS preflight] Do OPTIONS preflight requests bypass size checking, and could attackers exploit this to probe system behavior before sending actual oversized attacks? (Low)",
