  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Duplicate key creation] If create_key() is called multiple times with the same name, does it return the existing key or create a new one? Can this behavior be exploited to lose validator keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: export_private_key()] [Key export authorization] Does export_private_key() verify that the calling process has authorization to export keys from its namespace, or can any process export any key? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: sign()] [Message hash collision] For CryptoHash trait bounds on messages, can an attacker find hash collisions to make the same signature valid for different messages, breaking consensus message integrity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: get_public_key_previous_version()] [Version enumeration] Can an attacker enumerate all previous key versions by repeatedly calling this function, building a complete key rotation history for validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: import_private_key()] [Key format validation] Does import_private_key() validate that the imported Ed25519PrivateKey is cryptographically valid, or can attackers import malformed keys that cause signing failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: sign_using_version()] [Version mismatch exploitation] If the specified version (public key) doesn't match any stored private key version, does this leak information about which versions exist in storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: rotate_key()] [Maximum version limit] Does the storage system enforce 'at most two versions'? Can attackers force unlimited key rotations to exhaust storage or cause DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: create_key()] [Concurrent key creation] If two threads call create_key() with the same name simultaneously in the same namespace, can race conditions cause both to succeed, creating ambiguity about which key is authoritative? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: export_private_key_for_version()] [Version spoofing] Can an attacker provide a fake version (public key that doesn't correspond to actual stored keys) to cause unexpected behavior or information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: sign()] [Nonce reuse in signing] Does the Ed25519 signing implementation use proper random nonces? Can namespace isolation issues cause nonce reuse across validators, breaking signature security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: inner()] [Direct storage access] Can an attacker obtain a reference to the inner storage through inner() and bypass all namespace isolation to directly access keys from any namespace? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: inner_mut()] [Mutable storage manipulation] Can an attacker use inner_mut() to obtain mutable access to the underlying storage and modify keys in other namespaces, including validator consensus keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: into_inner()] [Ownership transfer exploit] Can an attacker call into_inner() to take ownership of the storage backend and operate on it without namespace restrictions, accessing all validators' keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Global state wipe] The reset_and_clear() function explicitly bypasses namespacing and clears all storage. Is this function properly protected by feature flags, or can it be called in production to delete all validator keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: inner()] [Reference lifetime exploitation] Can an attacker abuse Rust lifetime rules to maintain a long-lived reference to inner storage, then use it after the Namespaced wrapper is dropped to bypass access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: available()] [Availability check bypass] The available() check delegates directly to inner storage without namespace filtering. Can this leak information about storage state across all namespaces? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Impl: Namespaced<&S>] [Shared reference exploit] The special implementation for Namespaced<&S> allows calling get() on a shared reference. Can this bypass mutability checks and allow concurrent access that breaks isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: inner_mut()] [Mutex poisoning] If the inner storage uses Mutex or RwLock, can an attacker poison the lock through inner_mut() access, causing all namespace operations to fail and halting validator operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: into_inner()] [Drop handler bypass] By calling into_inner() and taking ownership, can an attacker bypass drop handlers that would normally clean up sensitive key material from memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: reset_and_clear()] [Testing flag confusion] If the 'testing' feature is accidentally enabled in production builds, can attackers call reset_and_clear() to wipe all validator keys and halt the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Function: inner()] [Interior mutability exploit] Can an attacker use inner() to obtain a reference, then exploit interior mutability patterns (Cell, RefCell) in the storage backend to modify state despite having only a shared reference? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/src/namespaced.rs] [Struct: Namespaced] [Field access via unsafe] Can an attacker use unsafe Rust code to directly access the 'namespace' and 'inner' fields of Namespaced struct, bypassing the public API and its protections? (High)",
