  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_token_property_map_event.rs] [Struct: MutateTokenPropertyMapEvent] [TokenId Relationship] Does the struct enforce any relationship between old_id and new_id (same collection, same creator, incrementing property_version), or can arbitrary unrelated TokenIds be used causing semantic violations?

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_token_property_map_event.rs] [Struct: MutateTokenPropertyMapEvent] [Property Deletion] How are property deletions represented - as empty values, missing keys, or special type strings - and can attackers exploit ambiguity to maintain deleted properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_token_property_map_event.rs] [Struct: MutateTokenPropertyMapEvent] [Reserved Property Keys] Are there reserved property key names that should never be mutated (e.g., owner, creator), and does this event type enforce those restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/mutate_token_property_map_event.rs] [Struct: MutateTokenPropertyMapEvent] [Property Type Changes] Can a property's type be changed from one type to another (e.g., u64 to address) within a single mutation event, potentially causing type confusion in applications?
