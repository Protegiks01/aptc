  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_block_metrics()] [Lock contention] Does updating metrics from three different stores while holding locks create performance bottlenecks that can be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_blocks_for_state_sync_commit()] [Commit ordering violation] Can state sync commits arrive out of order, causing update_root() to set an older root than current, rolling back consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_blocks_for_state_sync_commit()] [Partial update] If update_root() succeeds but remove_blocks_for_epoch_round() fails, can this create inconsistency where root points to committed blocks that still exist in payload store? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_blocks_for_state_sync_commit()] [Race with handle_committed_blocks] Can update_blocks_for_state_sync_commit() and handle_committed_blocks() execute concurrently, both updating root and removing blocks, causing double removal or missed blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_blocks_for_state_sync_commit()] [Proof verification bypass] Does this function verify commit_proof before calling update_root(), or can an attacker provide invalid proof causing observer to commit to wrong state? (Critical)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_ordered_block_commit_decision()] [Commit overwrite] Can calling this function multiple times with different CommitDecisions for same block cause the last commit to overwrite earlier valid commits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_ordered_block_commit_decision()] [Uncommitted block] Does this function validate that a block exists in ordered_block_store before updating its commit decision, or can commits for non-existent blocks be injected? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_ordered_block_commit_decision()] [Fork commit] Can an attacker update commit decisions for blocks on a competing fork, causing the observer to track commits on wrong chain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_root()] [Rollback attack] Can calling update_root() with an older LedgerInfoWithSignatures roll back the consensus state to a previous root, allowing replay of old transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_root()] [Signature verification] Does this function verify the signatures in new_root before updating, or can an attacker set an arbitrary root with invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_root()] [Epoch validation] Does update_root() validate that new_root's epoch is valid and doesn't skip epochs, preventing epoch skip attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: update_root()] [Concurrent update race] Can multiple threads call update_root() simultaneously, causing non-deterministic final root value depending on timing? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payloads_against_ordered_block()] [Partial verification] If verification fails for some blocks in ordered_block but succeeds for others, does an error prevent execution of all blocks or can valid-seeming blocks still execute? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payloads_against_ordered_block()] [Error handling] When this function returns Error, are the invalid payloads removed from the store or do they persist, allowing retry attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payloads_against_ordered_block()] [Mutable borrow] Does taking &mut self allow this verification to modify state in ways that could be exploited if called on same data concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payload_signatures()] [Selective verification] Can an attacker exploit that this returns Vec<Round> to selectively verify only some payloads, leaving others unverified for later exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payload_signatures()] [Epoch mismatch] If epoch_state doesn't match the payload epochs, can incorrect validators be used for verification, accepting payloads with wrong signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/block_data.rs] [Function: verify_payload_signatures()] [Replay attack] After successful verification, are payload signatures marked as verified permanently, or can they be reset allowing signature bypass on replay? (High)",
