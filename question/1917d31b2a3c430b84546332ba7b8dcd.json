  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Function: unexpected_msg_count_inc()] [Protocol attack] Can unexpected network messages indicate a protocol-level attack, and is this counter properly monitored for anomaly detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Static: SHARED_MEMPOOL_TRANSACTIONS_PROCESSED] [Label validation] Are the status and network label values properly validated to prevent label injection or cardinality explosion from malicious inputs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Function: shared_mempool_broadcast_size()] [DoS detection] Can unusually large broadcast sizes detected through this metric indicate a bandwidth exhaustion attack or mempool flooding? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Static: CORE_MEMPOOL_PARKING_LOT_EVICTED_COUNT] [Transaction censorship] Can patterns in parking lot evictions reveal transaction censorship or selective processing by validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Static: ACTIVE_UPSTREAM_PEERS_COUNT] [Sybil attack detection] Can sudden changes in active upstream peer counts indicate a Sybil attack or network manipulation targeting specific validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Label constants] [Hardcoded strings] Are all label constant strings (PRIORITY_INDEX_LABEL, etc.) immutable and protected from runtime modification that could corrupt metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/mempool/src/counters.rs] [Test: generate_ranking_score_buckets()] [Bucket calculation] Does the test verify that ranking score bucket boundaries match the expected formula, preventing metric misclassification in production? (Low)"
