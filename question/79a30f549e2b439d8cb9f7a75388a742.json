  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/resolver.rs] [Function: generate_delayed_field_id()] [ID collision] The documentation at line 168 states IDs should be unique per-block - if implementation is flawed, can an attacker cause ID collisions allowing them to manipulate multiple aggregators through a single ID? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/resolver.rs] [Function: generate_delayed_field_id()] [Determinism failure] If ID generation is not deterministic across all validators, could this cause state divergence where validators disagree on which aggregator an ID refers to, breaking consensus?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-aggregator/src/resolver.rs] [Function: get_reads_needing_exchange()] [Resource leak] The method documentation at lines 173-178 describes resources with delayed fields that need exchange - if unimplemented, can this cause resources to be incorrectly written to storage without proper value exchange?
