  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Function: get()] [Lock contention amplification] By making many concurrent get() calls that just miss cache expiration at line 40, can an attacker maximize lock contention at lines 48-49, causing node-checker to become unresponsive? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Struct: OutputCache] [Memory leak via clone] If T contains Rc/Arc references to large structures, can repeated cloning at lines 42 and 53 create memory leaks by increasing reference counts without proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Struct: OutputCache] [Drop implementation missing] Since OutputCache doesn't implement Drop, are resources properly cleaned up when the cache is destroyed, or can this lead to resource leaks in long-running node-checker processes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization invariants] Are there any invariants that should be checked during construction at line 25-31, such as minimum cache_ttl values or T type constraints to prevent misuse? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Struct: OutputCache] [State transitions] Can OutputCache transition through invalid states (e.g., last_output = Some but last_run very old) that violate assumptions made by node-checker about data freshness? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Struct: OutputCache] [Debug trait exposure] The Debug implementation at line 13 may expose internal state - can this leak sensitive node information through logs, making it easier for attackers to profile node behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Function: get()] [Metrics & monitoring] Since there are no metrics or telemetry, can cache effectiveness issues (high miss rate, errors) go undetected, allowing persistent problems to affect node health monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Function: get()] [Borrow checker interaction] Do the multiple lock acquisitions (read at 40, write at 48-49) properly satisfy Rust's borrow checker, or can there be subtle lifetime issues that allow data races in unsafe contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/provider/cache.rs] [Function: get()] [Pin/Unpin safety] Since the function signature uses impl Future, are there any Pin safety concerns if the Future captures references to OutputCache internals? (Low)"
