  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Historical state access] Can the request combined with old ledger versions access historical state that has been pruned, potentially exposing sensitive deleted data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Version rollback] Can an attacker query state at an old version to observe intermediate transaction states or pending writes that reveal sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Future version] What happens if a ledger_version parameter higher than the current version is provided - can this cause undefined behavior or state leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [StateView bypass] Does the raw_value() function properly enforce StateView access controls, or can malicious keys bypass restrictions on state queries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Database transaction] Are state reads within a proper database transaction boundary, or can concurrent writes cause torn reads? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Jellyfish Merkle] Can the key be crafted to directly access internal Merkle tree nodes rather than leaf state values, leaking tree structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [AptosDB sharding] If state is sharded across multiple databases, can key manipulation cause queries to hit wrong shards, returning incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Hidden endpoint] Since the endpoint using this type is marked 'hidden', does it lack security hardening present in public APIs, making it more vulnerable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [BCS-only restriction] The endpoint only accepts BCS format - can this restriction be bypassed by manipulating Accept headers or content negotiation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Experimental stability] As an experimental API, are there incomplete validations or security checks that would be present in stable endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [TableHandle enumeration] Can an attacker brute-force TableHandle values in StateKey::TableItem to discover all active tables in the blockchain? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Table key extraction] Can crafted keys extract table items without knowing the proper key type, bypassing Move type safety for table access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Cross-table access] Can manipulating the TableHandle allow reading from tables the requester shouldn't have access to, like governance voting records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Module access] Can StateKey::AccessPath with Path::Code variant be used to extract module bytecode from protected framework accounts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Resource extraction] Can StateKey::AccessPath with Path::Resource be crafted to read any resource type at any address, bypassing Move visibility rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [ResourceGroup access] Does StateKey::AccessPath with Path::ResourceGroup properly validate group membership, or can attackers read resources outside their group? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [VerifyInput bypass] Does RawStateValueRequest implement the VerifyInput trait, and if not, does it skip critical validation that other request types undergo? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Schema validation] Does the poem_openapi Object derive enforce schema constraints, or can requests violate the API contract without rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Content-Type bypass] Can an attacker submit non-JSON payloads that are incorrectly parsed as RawStateValueRequest, bypassing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [State proof missing] Does the response include Merkle proofs for the returned state value, or can the API return unverified data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Commitment mismatch] If the state value is fetched without proper synchronization, can it return data that doesn't match the committed state root? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Speculative state] Can the key access speculative or uncommitted state from the transaction pool rather than confirmed ledger state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Cross-account access] In multi-tenant deployments, can one tenant use crafted keys to access another tenant's state data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Namespace collision] If multiple environments share state storage, can key manipulation cause cross-environment data leaks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/types/src/state.rs] [Struct: RawStateValueRequest] [Log injection] When the hex-encoded key is logged, can it contain control characters or malicious strings that compromise log integrity? (Low)"
