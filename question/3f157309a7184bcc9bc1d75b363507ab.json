  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Enum: TxnEmitterCommand] [Type Confusion] If new subcommands are added in the future, could enum variant confusion lead to executing the wrong command type with mismatched arguments, causing fund loss or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage Blind Spot] Does the clap debug_assert() at line 121 validate security-critical argument constraints, or only basic parsing correctness, leaving security validation gaps that could be exploited in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Function: verify_tool()] [Test Environment Leakage] Can test-only configurations or debug features remain enabled in production builds, exposing additional attack surface? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Account Compromise] Does cluster.load_coin_source_account() at diag.rs:17 securely load the private key, or can an attacker with file system access steal the coin source key and drain all testing funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Entropy Weakness] The StdRng::from_entropy() at diag.rs:21 seeds the RNG - is this cryptographically secure, or can an attacker predict transaction patterns if system entropy is low, enabling front-running attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Gas Price Manipulation] The hardcoded GAS_UNIT_PRICE constant at diag.rs:20 - can an attacker manipulate this value through environment variables or config files to set artificially low gas prices that bypass network congestion controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Sequence Number Desync] At diag.rs:24-37, if coin_source_account.sequence_number() increments but the transaction fails, can this cause permanent desynchronization where all subsequent transactions are rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Transaction Expiration] Does submit_single_transaction() at diag.rs:28-35 set appropriate expiration times, or can transactions linger in mempools indefinitely, potentially being executed much later than intended with stale state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Error Message Injection] The format_err! at diag.rs:36 includes the instance name - can an attacker control instance names to inject misleading error messages that hide the true failure cause? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Polling Loop DoS] The infinite loop at diag.rs:43-74 continuously polls all instances - can an attacker add thousands of instances to cluster_args, causing the loop to take excessive time and block other operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Concurrent Query Race] At diag.rs:44-51, join_all() queries sequence numbers concurrently - can response timing differences cause race conditions where validators appear out of sync when they're actually consistent? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Status Logic Inversion] At diag.rs:58-63, the status is marked 'good' when seq != expected and 'bad' when seq == expected - is this a critical logic bug that inverts health check results, causing operators to think healthy nodes are failing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Deadline Bypass] At diag.rs:70-72, can an attacker manipulate the deadline value returned by submit_single_transaction() to extend it indefinitely, causing the health check to never timeout and hang forever? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Hostname Truncation] The min(host.len(), 10) truncation at diag.rs:64 - can this cause hostname collisions where different instances appear identical, masking the true source of failures? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Sleep Timing Attack] The tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)) at diag.rs:73 is fixed at 1 second - can an attacker exploit this predictable timing to time attacks between polling intervals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Transaction Amount Hardcoding] The hardcoded amount '10' at diag.rs:33 - is this sufficient to trigger all validation logic, or can attackers exploit differences in validation behavior for different transaction amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Cluster Randomness Bias] The cluster.random_instance() at diag.rs:16 - if the RNG is biased, can it consistently select compromised nodes, causing all diagnostics to route through attacker-controlled infrastructure?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [REST Client Reuse] Are rest_client() instances at diag.rs:16,30,46 properly authenticated and rate-limited, or can an attacker exhaust API quotas by triggering many diag() calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [All-or-Nothing Failure] The all_good flag at diag.rs:52 requires ALL instances to be synchronized - can a single Byzantine node cause permanent health check failure by always reporting stale sequence numbers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/transaction-emitter/src/main.rs] [Module: diag] [Function: diag()] [Success Message Premature] The 'all full nodes are healthy!' message at diag.rs:76 - does this accurately reflect health, or can nodes fail immediately after the check passes, giving false confidence?
