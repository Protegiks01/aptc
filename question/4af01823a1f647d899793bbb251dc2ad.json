  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 16] [Result Mutation] Can concurrent access to the result vector cause data races if multiple threads call this function simultaneously, potentially corrupting the generated proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 44] [Reconfigure Atomicity] If reconfigure() fails partway through updating validator nodes, can it leave the network in an inconsistent state with some validators using the new JWK config and others using the old one? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 29] [ConfigOff Timing] When switching to ConfigOff, is there proper synchronization to ensure all validators stop JWK consensus simultaneously, or can timing differences cause validators to accept/reject blocks inconsistently? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 32-41] [ConfigV1 Atomicity] During ConfigV1 updates with multiple OIDC providers, are all providers applied atomically, or can partial application cause inconsistent authentication states across validators? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 34] [Provider Validation] Is there any validation that OIDC provider URLs point to legitimate, trusted identity providers, or can any arbitrary URL be added as a provider? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 34] [URL Scheme Validation] Can an attacker provide non-HTTPS URLs or local file:// URIs in config_url to bypass TLS verification or access local system resources during JWK fetching? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 33-35] [Provider Duplication] Can duplicate OIDC providers with the same name but different URLs be added to create confusion or enable phishing attacks where validators query different providers for the same identity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 33-35] [Empty Provider List] Can an attacker propose ConfigV1 with an empty oidc_providers vector, effectively disabling JWK consensus without using ConfigOff, creating inconsistent security states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 34] [Provider Name Collision] Can an attacker add providers with names that collide with legitimate providers (e.g., 'google.com' vs 'accounts.google.com'), causing authentication confusion? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 34] [Redirect Attacks] Can OIDC config_url values use redirects that validators blindly follow, potentially leading to attacks where legitimate-looking URLs redirect to malicious JWK servers? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 34] [DNS Rebinding] Can attacker-controlled OIDC provider domains use DNS rebinding to serve legitimate JWKs during validation but malicious JWKs during actual consensus operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/jwk_consensus_config.rs] [Line 20-46] [Script Syntax] Can edge cases in the config parameter cause generate_governance_proposal to generate syntactically invalid Move code that fails compilation, wasting governance voting resources? (Medium)",
