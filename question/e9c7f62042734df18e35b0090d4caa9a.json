  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Function: TransactionProvider::get_transaction()] [Double verification] The get_transaction() implementation checks is_valid() and then calls expect_valid() - is this redundant check hiding a deeper issue where Invalid transactions might be incorrectly processed? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Function: TransactionProvider::get_transaction()] [None handling] When get_transaction() returns None for Invalid transactions, can code that expects Some(_) fail to handle None properly, leading to unwrap panics or logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Function: TransactionProvider::get_transaction()] [Execution filtering] Does get_transaction() serve as the gatekeeper preventing Invalid transactions from reaching the VM - if bypassed, can Invalid transactions be executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Deserialization attack] The enum derives Deserialize - can an attacker craft malicious serialized data that deserializes into a Valid transaction without actual signature verification, bypassing cryptographic checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Serialization format manipulation] Can an attacker modify the serialized representation to flip a transaction from Invalid to Valid during network transmission or storage, allowing unsigned transactions to execute? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [State sync vulnerability] When synchronizing state across validators, are SignatureVerifiedTransactions properly re-verified, or can an attacker inject Invalid-marked-as-Valid transactions through state sync? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Snapshot corruption] Can corrupted database snapshots or backups contain SignatureVerifiedTransactions with wrong Valid/Invalid tags, causing execution inconsistencies when restored? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Clone vulnerability] The enum derives Clone - can cloned Invalid transactions be inadvertently passed to execution code that assumes cloning preserves validation state, leading to Invalid transaction execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Memory sharing] When SignatureVerifiedTransactions are cloned for parallel execution, can race conditions occur if the underlying Transaction is mutated through interior mutability, invalidating signatures after verification? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Block proposal validation] When validators propose blocks containing SignatureVerifiedTransactions, do other validators re-verify signatures, or do they trust the Valid tag, potentially accepting blocks with forged transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Quorum certificate verification] Can Invalid transactions be included in blocks that receive valid quorum certificates, allowing Byzantine validators to sneak Invalid transactions into committed blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Voting rule exploitation] If validators vote on blocks without re-checking transaction validity, can < 1/3 Byzantine validators propose Invalid transactions that get committed by honest majority? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Leader election manipulation] Can an adversarial leader include only Invalid transactions in proposed blocks to waste validator resources, then propose a valid block in the next round to gain timing advantage? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [VM execution bypass] Does the Move VM check is_valid() before executing transactions, or can Invalid transactions reach the VM through alternative code paths (API, mempool, etc.)? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Gas metering inconsistency] Are Invalid transactions charged gas for signature verification attempts, and can attackers exploit gas calculation differences between Valid and Invalid transactions for economic attacks? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Prologue skip] Can Invalid transactions bypass transaction prologue checks (sequence number, gas, sender existence) that normally occur before execution, allowing impossible transactions to execute? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Parallel execution] In Block-STM parallel execution, can race conditions between Valid and Invalid transaction processing cause non-deterministic execution results across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [State write conflicts] Can Invalid transactions still acquire write locks on state keys during parallel execution, blocking Valid transactions and causing unnecessary execution conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Empty transaction handling] What happens if a SignatureVerifiedTransaction wraps an empty or malformed Transaction - is it marked Invalid, or can it pass through with undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Signature algorithm mismatch] If the underlying Transaction uses an unsupported or deprecated signature scheme, is it correctly marked Invalid, or can it pass as Valid due to loose validation? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Chain ID validation] Does signature verification include chain ID checks to prevent cross-chain replay attacks, or can transactions from test networks be replayed on mainnet? (High)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Expiration time] If a transaction expires between signature verification and execution, does it remain Valid or should it be re-checked, potentially executing expired transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [Sequence number gaps] Can transactions with non-sequential sequence numbers be marked Valid if signatures are correct, then cause execution failures that waste block space? (Low)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [BlockMetadata injection] Since BlockMetadata transactions are automatically Valid, can attackers inject fake BlockMetadata transactions if they gain access to transaction processing paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: types/src/transaction/signature_verified_transaction.rs] [Enum: SignatureVerifiedTransaction] [ValidatorTransaction forgery] Are ValidatorTransaction types properly authenticated before being wrapped as Valid, or can any validator propose ValidatorTransactions without consensus approval? (Critical)"
