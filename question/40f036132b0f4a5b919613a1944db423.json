  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_sender_for_network_id()] [Network enumeration] Can calling get_sender_for_network_id() with attacker-controlled NetworkId values leak information about available networks? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Struct: PeerMetadata] [Metadata immutability] Once connection_metadata is set in PeerMetadata, can it be modified by malicious code to change protocol support or other security-critical parameters? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/metadata.rs] [Struct: PeerMetadata] [Clone safety] When PeerMetadata is cloned via the Clone trait, are all security-sensitive fields properly deep-copied, or can shallow copies allow mutation through aliasing? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_metadata_for_peer()] [Metadata staleness] How long can cached metadata remain stale before being refreshed, and can attackers exploit long staleness windows to send messages using outdated peer capabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: group_peers_by_protocol()] [Log spam prevention] The sample! macro limits logging to once per 10 seconds for unavailable peers - can this cause critical peer unavailability events to be missed during debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Silent failure logging] When broadcast() silently drops messages due to full channels, is this adequately monitored, or can systematic message loss go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer()] [Protocol negotiation failure] If get_preferred_protocol_for_peer() fails because no common protocol exists, is this error handled gracefully, or can it cause validator crashes during network protocol upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peers()] [Empty peer list] Does send_to_peers() handle the case of an empty peer list gracefully, or can this trigger unexpected behavior in the protocol grouping logic? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: set_cached_peers_and_metadata()] [Cache poisoning] Can rapid concurrent writes to cached_peers_and_metadata cause a newer cache to be overwritten by an older one, creating a window for stale data exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_connected_supported_peers()] [Peer filtering bypass] Can an attacker craft a peer that appears to support protocols in metadata but fails when actual messages are sent, bypassing the filtering in get_connected_supported_peers()? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: to_bytes_by_protocol()] [Protocol downgrade via serialization] Can differences in how to_bytes() serializes messages for different protocols be exploited to cause protocol confusion or downgrade attacks? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: update_peer_monitoring_metadata()] [Unbounded metadata growth] Is peer_monitoring_metadata size-limited, or can malicious peers send bloated metadata causing memory exhaustion over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: sort_peers_by_latency()] [Latency overflow] If average_ping_latency_secs contains extreme values (very large floats), can this cause precision loss or incorrect sorting that biases peer selection? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: remove_peer_metadata()] [Connection ID collision] Can ConnectionId values wrap around or collide after long uptimes, causing remove_peer_metadata() to incorrectly reject legitimate disconnect requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Struct: NetworkClient] [Clone semantics] When NetworkClient is cloned, are all fields properly cloned including Arc references, or can clone() create unexpected sharing that violates isolation? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Subscriber ordering] Does the order of subscribers in the subscribers vector matter for message delivery, and can reordering after eviction cause priority inversions? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: get_available_peers()] [Duplicate protocol handling] If direct_send_protocols_and_preferences and rpc_protocols_and_preferences contain overlapping protocols, can this cause duplicate peers in the returned list? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: get_trusted_peer_state()] [Trust state modification] After retrieving trusted peer state, can modifications to the returned Peer object affect the canonical trust state, or is it properly isolated? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: disconnect_from_peer()] [Disconnect reason validation] Is the disconnect_reason parameter validated and logged for audit purposes, or can malicious code hide the true reason for disconnects? (Low)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: insert_connection_metadata()] [Notification timing] Can NewPeer notifications be sent before connection_metadata is fully committed to storage, causing subscribers to act on incomplete connection state? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/interface.rs] [Function: send_to_peer_raw()] [Size limits] Does send_to_peer_raw() enforce message size limits on raw bytes, or can oversized messages bypass normal validation and cause buffer overflows downstream? (High)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Function: subscribe()] [Subscription limit] Is there a limit on the number of subscribers, or can unlimited subscriptions cause memory exhaustion and slow down broadcast operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: network/framework/src/application/storage.rs] [Multiple functions] [RwLock poisoning] If a thread panics while holding the peers_and_metadata write lock, does this poison the RwLock causing all subsequent operations to fail? (High)",
