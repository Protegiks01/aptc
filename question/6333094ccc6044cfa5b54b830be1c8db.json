  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Unbounded input] The msg parameter is &str with no length limit - can extremely large API responses cause out-of-memory conditions when converted to bytes, causing tests to crash and miss security bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [No newline handling] The log() function doesn't add newlines - can multiple log() calls create an unparseable JSON blob where individual API responses can't be distinguished, breaking all golden file assertions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [No validation] The 'name' parameter has no validation - can empty strings, special characters, or very long names cause filesystem errors that crash tests before API security checks can run? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Attribute: clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync] [Suppressed warning] The file suppresses clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync warning - is Mint actually thread-safe? Can this lead to data races if GoldenOutputs is shared across threads during concurrent API testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Attribute: clippy::arc_with_non_send_sync] [Hidden undefined behavior] Suppressing this warning might hide actual undefined behavior - can this cause subtle corruption in golden files that manifests as flaky test failures during security audits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Dependency: goldenfile] [Third-party trust] The code depends on the goldenfile crate's Mint type - if this crate has bugs or is compromised, could it affect the integrity of API security test results? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Mint behavior] The code assumes Mint::new() always succeeds - but what if the goldenfile crate changes behavior in future versions? Could this break all API security tests without warning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Path construction] PathBuf::push() followed by with_extension() - can specific input strings cause the final path to not have the .json extension, creating files that other test infrastructure can't parse? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [File permissions] The code doesn't set explicit file permissions - can golden files be created with overly permissive modes that allow unauthorized modification, potentially injecting false API responses into security tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: new()] [Symbolic link attack] If GOLDEN_DIR_PATH is a symlink to a sensitive directory, could tests write golden files to unintended locations, potentially overwriting security-critical configuration files? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Struct: GoldenOutputs] [No reset mechanism] Once created, there's no way to reset or reinitialize a GoldenOutputs instance - can this cause tests to accumulate state, where later API tests are affected by earlier test output? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Append-only] The log function only appends - there's no way to clear or truncate - can this cause golden files to grow unbounded if tests are run repeatedly, eventually hitting filesystem limits? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Struct: GoldenOutputs] [Clone semantics] The Clone trait creates shared Arc pointers - can this lead to confusion where developers expect isolated copies but get shared state, causing test pollution in parallel API security tests? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/api/test-context/src/golden_output.rs] [Function: log()] [Lock contention] All writes go through a single Mutex - can high-concurrency tests experience severe lock contention, making tests so slow that security test suites time out before completion? (Low)"
