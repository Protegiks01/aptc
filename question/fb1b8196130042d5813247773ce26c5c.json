  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: new()] [State inconsistency] Can an attacker construct a WrappedLedgerInfo with mismatched vote_data and signed_ledger_info where the vote_data.hash() does not equal signed_ledger_info.consensus_data_hash(), bypassing later validation and causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Epoch confusion] Can an attacker create a WrappedLedgerInfo where vote_data.proposed().epoch() differs from signed_ledger_info.ledger_info().epoch(), causing epoch transition attacks or validator set confusion when the object is processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Round manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator create a WrappedLedgerInfo with vote_data rounds that don't match signed_ledger_info rounds, potentially allowing round number manipulation attacks to bypass consensus safety rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: new()] [Deserialization attack] Since WrappedLedgerInfo derives Deserialize, can an attacker craft malicious serialized data that creates invalid state when deserialized, bypassing constructor validation and creating corrupted consensus objects? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: dummy()] [Test code in production] The dummy() function is available with feature='fuzzing' - can this be exploited in production builds where fuzzing features are accidentally enabled, allowing creation of invalid consensus objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify_consensus_data_hash()] [Hash collision] Does verify_consensus_data_hash() use collision-resistant hashing, or can an attacker find hash collisions between different vote_data values that produce the same consensus_data_hash, enabling vote manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify_consensus_data_hash()] [Incomplete validation] The function only checks hash equality - does it validate that the vote_data itself is well-formed (proper epoch, round, parent relationships), or can attackers use valid hashes with malformed vote_data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify_consensus_data_hash()] [Error handling bypass] If verify_consensus_data_hash() returns an error, are all callers properly propagating this error, or can some code paths ignore the failure and proceed with invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify_consensus_data_hash()] [Race condition] Is vote_data.hash() computation deterministic and thread-safe, or can concurrent modifications to vote_data during hashing cause non-deterministic hash values leading to consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: certified_block()] [Order vote bypass] The function ensures !order_vote_enabled before returning - can an attacker manipulate the order_vote_enabled flag in transit or through configuration to bypass this check and access invalid certified_block data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: certified_block()] [NIL block confusion] Can an attacker exploit certified_block() with NIL blocks (where timestamp equals parent timestamp) to cause consensus issues, especially during the transition between order_vote enabled/disabled states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: certified_block()] [Double verification cost] The function calls verify_consensus_data_hash() every time - can an attacker trigger repeated calls to certified_block() to cause performance degradation through expensive cryptographic hash recomputation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: certified_block()] [Reference lifetime exploit] The function returns &BlockInfo reference - can attackers exploit Rust lifetime issues if the underlying WrappedLedgerInfo is modified while the reference is held, causing use-after-free or data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Genesis signature bypass] For genesis blocks (round 0), the function skips signature verification and only checks voter count is 0 - can an attacker forge a genesis block for a later epoch by setting round=0 but with non-genesis data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Round zero exploitation] The TODO comment indicates uncertainty about using ledger_info().round() instead of certified_block().round() for genesis check - can this inconsistency be exploited to bypass signature verification by manipulating round numbers? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Validator set confusion] Does verify() use the correct validator set for the epoch in signed_ledger_info, or can attackers exploit epoch transitions to verify signatures against wrong validator sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Signature aggregation bypass] The function calls verify_signatures() on LedgerInfoWithSignatures - can an attacker exploit BLS signature aggregation vulnerabilities to create valid-looking but forged aggregate signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Quorum threshold manipulation] Does verify_signatures() properly check that signatures represent >2/3 quorum, or can attackers with <2/3 stake create valid-looking WrappedLedgerInfo objects? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Between calling verify() and using the WrappedLedgerInfo, can the validator set change (epoch transition), causing signatures that were valid to become invalid or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Replay across epochs] Can an attacker replay a valid WrappedLedgerInfo from epoch N in epoch N+1, and does verify() properly prevent cross-epoch replay by checking epoch consistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: verify()] [Insufficient genesis validation] For genesis blocks, only voter count is checked - should the function also validate that the block content (parent, id, state root) matches expected genesis values to prevent fake genesis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: ends_epoch()] [Epoch transition bypass] The function delegates to signed_ledger_info.ledger_info().ends_epoch() - can attackers manipulate the ends_epoch flag to prevent or force epoch transitions, causing validator set update failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: ends_epoch()] [Reconfiguration attack] Can an attacker create a WrappedLedgerInfo that claims to end an epoch but has invalid or malicious next_epoch_state, causing the entire validator set to follow corrupted reconfiguration? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch overflow] Does epoch() properly handle u64 overflow when epoch numbers approach MAX, or can integer overflow cause epoch confusion and validator set inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/consensus-types/src/wrapped_ledger_info.rs] [Function: epoch()] [Epoch mismatch] Can vote_data.proposed().epoch() differ from signed_ledger_info.ledger_info().epoch() in a WrappedLedgerInfo, and which epoch() should be trusted - the function currently only returns ledger_info's epoch? (High)"
