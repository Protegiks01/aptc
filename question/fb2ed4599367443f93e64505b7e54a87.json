(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Constant: BYTES_TO_TRANSFER] [Integer overflow] Could setting BYTES_TO_TRANSFER to maximum usize values cause integer overflow in the saturating_add operations throughout the read/write loops, leading to incorrect throughput measurements that mask rate limiter bypass vulnerabilities? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rate-limiter/src/main.rs] [Function: stats()] [Float conversion overflow] Could the as_millis() conversion at line 134 overflow when duration is extremely large, or could the division by 1000.0 cause precision loss that masks rate limiter timing attacks? (Low)",
