(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: Environment::new()] [Hash preimage attack] If an attacker controls the order of data fed to sha3_256.update(), can they manipulate the hash computation to create environments with identical hashes but different actual configurations, bypassing deterministic execution guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm-environment/src/environment.rs] [Function: PartialEq::eq()] [Environment confusion] Since PartialEq only compares hash values, can an attacker exploit hash collisions to cause validators to accept incompatible environments as equivalent, leading to state divergence and chain splits?
