  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_transit_sign_response()] [Base64 signature injection] Can arbitrary base64 strings be crafted to produce valid-looking but cryptographically invalid Ed25519Signature objects that bypass verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_transit_sign_response()] [Signature piece manipulation] Does the split(':') and get(2) logic properly validate all signature components, or can attackers inject colons to manipulate which piece is used? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_transit_sign_response()] [Signature length validation] Does Ed25519Signature::try_from() strictly enforce 64-byte signature length, or can truncated signatures be accepted causing signature malleability? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_unsealed_response()] [Seal status spoofing] Can an attacker forge unsealed responses when Vault is actually sealed, causing validators to attempt operations that should be blocked, leaking information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_unsealed_response()] [Boolean inversion] Does the sealed flag negation (!resp.sealed) in process_unsealed_response() create a logic bug where sealed and unsealed states can be confused? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Function: arb_unsealed_response()] [Unauthenticated check] Since unsealed() can be queried without authentication, can attackers use seal status responses to time side-channel attacks on Vault operations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/secure/storage/vault/src/fuzzing.rs] [Constant: ProptestConfig] [Insufficient coverage] Does ProptestConfig::with_cases(10) provide adequate fuzzing coverage for cryptographic operations, or should more test cases be used to detect rare vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
