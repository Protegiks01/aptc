  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 11] [Memory allocator vulnerability] Can the jemalloc global allocator configuration be exploited through heap spraying or memory corruption attacks when the backfiller processes large transaction batches from untrusted fullnodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 11] [Platform-specific behavior] Does the conditional compilation for jemalloc on Unix systems create security inconsistencies when the same backfiller binary runs on different platforms, potentially allowing platform-specific memory attacks? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 18] [Error handling panic] Does the .expect() call on line 18 cause an uncontrolled panic that could crash the backfiller service without proper cleanup, potentially corrupting progress files or leaving partial data in file storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 16-18] [Async runtime panic] If the ServerArgs.run() future panics during execution, can this leave the tokio runtime in an inconsistent state that prevents proper shutdown and resource cleanup? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 15] [Input validation bypass] Can an attacker supply malicious command-line arguments through ServerArgs::parse() that bypass configuration validation and allow the backfiller to connect to unauthorized fullnode endpoints or write to arbitrary file paths? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 15] [Path traversal] Does ServerArgs::parse() properly validate file paths provided via command-line arguments to prevent directory traversal attacks that could read/write files outside the intended storage directories? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 15] [Configuration injection] Can environment variables or command-line arguments be manipulated to inject malicious configuration values that override security-critical settings like chain_id, starting_version, or fullnode_grpc_address?

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 15] [Argument pollution] Does the clap Parser implementation handle duplicate or conflicting command-line arguments securely, or can argument pollution attacks cause unexpected configuration states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 13] [Async runtime exhaustion] Does the #[tokio::main] macro use default runtime settings that could allow a malicious fullnode to exhaust async task queues by sending extremely large transaction streams, causing the backfiller to hang or crash? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 13] [Signal handling] Does the tokio runtime properly handle SIGTERM, SIGINT, and other shutdown signals to ensure graceful termination with progress file flushing, or can abrupt termination corrupt the backfill state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 13-19] [Async cancellation safety] If the main async function is cancelled (e.g., via ctrl-c), are there cancellation-unsafe operations in the ServerArgs.run() call that could leave resources in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-grpc-v2-file-store-backfiller/src/main.rs] [Line 16] [Type confusion] Could a malicious actor compile a modified version of this binary with a different config type parameter to IndexerGrpcV2FileStoreBackfillerConfig, bypassing security validations in the configuration trait?
