(Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Infinite Loop] If all players have zero weight but threshold > 0, does the while loop at line 315 run infinitely, causing validator hang and loss of liveness in PVSS operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [RNG Manipulation] Can a Byzantine attacker predict or manipulate the RNG to force selection of specific players, enabling collusion attacks where selected players are all Byzantine and refuse to participate in reconstruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Integer Overflow] When current_weight += weight at line 329, can this overflow if threshold or weights are maliciously large, causing the loop condition to never terminate? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Logic Error] If the same player is selected multiple times (which shouldn't happen due to removal at line 325), could this cause weight double-counting and premature loop exit with insufficient actual players? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker craft weights such that the expected number of loop iterations is extremely high (e.g., many players with weight=1, threshold=W-1), causing timeout in subset selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_random_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Player Removal Bug] The swap-and-pop logic at lines 323-326 removes selected players.

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/weighted_config.rs] [Function: get_worst_case_eligible_subset_of_players()] [Reverse Logic] At line 217, reversing the sorted list means selecting lowest-weight players first.
