  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Derive: Deserialize] [Version compatibility] If RoyaltyMutate schema changes in future versions, can old events still be deserialized correctly, or will this break historical event replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Storage bloat] Can attackers create millions of RoyaltyMutate events to bloat event storage, eventually exhausting disk space on archive nodes and causing network degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Compression bypass] If events are stored compressed, can specially crafted RoyaltyMutate structures with high entropy strings defeat compression, wasting storage space? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Token existence] Does emitting a RoyaltyMutate event require that the referenced collection and token actually exist on-chain, or can fake events be created for non-existent tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Collection/token mismatch] Can an attacker emit events with valid collection name but invalid token name, causing indexers to apply royalty changes to wrong tokens? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [NFT burning] If a token is burned after RoyaltyMutate event emission but before state update, can this cause dangling references and payment routing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Transfer race] Can royalty mutations during NFT transfers cause confusion about which royalty settings apply to the sale, enabling sellers to avoid paying updated royalties? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Indexer poisoning] Can malicious events with extreme field values (huge strings, max u64 numbers) crash indexers that assume reasonable bounds, causing indexer downtime and incorrect royalty data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [SQL injection analog] If indexers store collection/token strings in databases without sanitization, can special characters in these fields cause query errors or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Event flooding] Can an attacker spam RoyaltyMutate events to overwhelm indexer processing capacity, causing delayed or missing royalty updates and enabling payment evasion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Inconsistent indexing] If different indexers process RoyaltyMutate events with slightly different logic, can this cause divergent views of royalty state across the ecosystem? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Impl: MoveStructType] [Module upgrade] If token_event_store module is upgraded, can old RoyaltyMutate events become unreadable, breaking historical audit trails and royalty payment verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Field addition] If new fields are added to RoyaltyMutate in future versions, can deserialization of old events fail, causing event replay failures during chain resyncs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Static: ROYALTY_MUTATE_TYPE] [Type tag changes] If TOKEN_ADDRESS or module/struct names change during protocol upgrades, can this break event type resolution causing all RoyaltyMutate events to become unprocessable? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [All-zero royalty] Can setting both numerator and denominator to zero create undefined royalty state that causes division-by-zero in some code paths but not others, leading to inconsistent behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Max value boundaries] Can setting royalty numerator and denominator to u64::MAX cause overflow in percentage calculations, wrapping around to 0% royalty and enabling payment evasion? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Empty strings] Can collection or token be empty strings, causing key collision issues in indexer databases where empty strings might be treated as NULL or special values? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Unicode edge cases] Can collection/token strings with unusual Unicode (emoji, RTL text, combining characters) break display or processing logic in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Identical old/new values] Can emitting RoyaltyMutate where all old_* fields equal corresponding new_* fields waste gas and create spurious events that pollute audit logs without actual changes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Event authenticity] Since events lack signatures, can malicious validator nodes inject fake RoyaltyMutate events into event streams during block production, deceiving light clients about royalty changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Commitment integrity] Are RoyaltyMutate events included in transaction or block commitment schemes, or can events be modified post-finality without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: try_from_bytes()] [Side channel] Can timing differences in BCS deserialization based on field values leak information about royalty settings to timing attack observers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Function: new()] [Gas calculation] Is gas cost for creating RoyaltyMutate properly metered based on string lengths, or can attackers create events with minimal gas by exploiting incorrect metering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/royalty_mutate.rs] [Struct: RoyaltyMutate] [Event emission cost] Can the cost of emitting RoyaltyMutate events be manipulated to be cheaper than it should be, enabling spam attacks without adequate economic deterrent? (Medium)",
