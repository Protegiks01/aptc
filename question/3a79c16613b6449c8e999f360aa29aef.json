  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Thread Safety of status_type()] If status_type() accesses mutable state in VMError, could concurrent calls to expect_no_verification_errors from different threads cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Format String Thread Safety] Is the format! macro invocation at lines 14-17 thread-safe when multiple threads format errors simultaneously, or could buffer corruption occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Builder Pattern Concurrency] Does the PartialVMError builder chain (lines 34-38) have any shared state that could cause race conditions when multiple errors are constructed concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [unreachable!() Exploitation] Could an attacker manipulate the StatusType enum or match conditions to reach the unreachable!() at line 31 in production, causing a validator panic and potential consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Panic During Error Construction] If PartialVMError::new() or any builder methods panic, could this leave the validator in an inconsistent state or be exploited for DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [OOM During format!] If the format! macro at lines 14-17 causes out-of-memory, is the panic handled gracefully or could it crash the validator node? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Double Panic Scenario] If this function is called during panic unwinding, could a panic in the format! or builder chain cause a double panic and abort the process? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Error Transformation Atomicity] Is the transformation from verification error to unexpected error atomic, or could partial transformations be observed by concurrent code? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [State Mutation in status_type()] If status_type() mutates the VMError, could repeated calls to this function cause different transformations and lead to inconsistent error states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Idempotency] Is this function idempotent (safe to call multiple times on the same error), or could repeated transformations accumulate and cause incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Untested Error Types] Are all possible VMError status types tested through this function, or could untested error types expose unexpected behavior in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Fuzzing Gap] Have the error message formatting and data extraction paths been fuzzed with malicious VMError inputs to detect crashes or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Integration Test Coverage] Are there integration tests that verify this function behaves correctly when used in actual module loading and transaction validation scenarios with real malicious bytecode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Log Injection via Error Message] Could the formatted error message at lines 14-17 be exploited for log injection attacks if it's later written to validator logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Metric Manipulation] If this function updates internal metrics or counters, could an attacker trigger verification errors deliberately to manipulate validator performance metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Timing Side Channel] Does the error transformation take different amounts of time depending on the error type or content, potentially leaking information through timing side channels? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Unused Variables Security] Are the _old_status, _old_sub_status, _old_message, and _stacktrace variables (lines 20-23) properly discarded, or could they contain security-sensitive data that should be explicitly zeroed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Message Replacement Attack] By discarding _old_message and replacing it with a new message, could this function hide attacker-crafted error messages that contain important attack signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-vm/runtime/src/logging.rs] [Function: expect_no_verification_errors()] [Stacktrace Suppression] Does discarding the _stacktrace at line 23 remove important debugging information that could help detect ongoing attacks or verify error origins? (Low)"
