  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Public Key Substitution] Between storing the public_key in the constructor and using it in as_noise_network_address(), can a race condition or concurrent modification allow an attacker to substitute a different public key? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Cookie Store Race Condition] The cookie_store is Arc<Jar> shared across multiple clients - can concurrent access from multiple threads cause race conditions in cookie reading/writing, leading to authentication bypass or session confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Cookie Leakage] The same cookie_store (line 98) is used for both metrics and API clients - can cookies intended for the API endpoint (potentially with authentication) leak to the metrics endpoint or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Cookie Persistence] Are cookies persisted across NodeAddress clones? Since cookie_store is Arc, cloning NodeAddress shares the same Jar - can this cause unintended cookie sharing between different node connections? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Cookie Store Initialization] The cookie_store is initialized with Jar::default() which is empty - but can an attacker exploit the lack of HttpOnly, Secure, or SameSite flags in cookies accepted by this Jar? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: Clone] [Cookie Store Cloning] When NodeAddress is cloned (derived Clone trait), the Arc<Jar> is shallow-copied - can this lead to unexpected cookie sharing between supposedly independent node connections, causing authentication confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Cookie Injection] Since the cookie_store is shared and skipped in serialization (line 33), can a deserialized NodeAddress have its cookie store manipulated by an attacker before it's used for requests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Timeout Bypass] The timeout parameter is user-controlled - can an attacker set an extremely large Duration to cause requests to hang indefinitely, blocking threads and exhausting resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Timeout Race Condition] If timeout is very small (e.g., Duration::from_millis(1)), can it cause race conditions where legitimate responses are rejected while attacks slip through? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Client Reuse] Each call creates a new reqwest::Client - can this exhaust connection pools or file descriptors if called repeatedly in a loop? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [TLS Configuration] The HTTP clients don't explicitly configure TLS settings - can an attacker exploit weak ciphers, missing certificate validation, or accept self-signed certificates to perform MITM attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Redirect Following] Does reqwest::Client follow redirects by default? If so, can an attacker redirect API/metrics requests to malicious servers or internal endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [HTTP Method Restrictions] Are there any restrictions on which HTTP methods can be used? Can an attacker use dangerous methods (TRACE, CONNECT) to exploit server vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_url()] [Unwrap Panic] The set_port() call uses unwrap() on line 79 - although it should never fail, can malformed URL state (e.g., cannot-be-a-base URLs) cause a panic, crashing the node checker? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_url()] [Unwrap Panic] The set_port() call uses unwrap() on line 89 - can this panic with special URL types (opaque URLs, mailto:, etc.) that don't support ports? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_metrics_client()] [Build Unwrap Panic] The ClientBuilder::new().build() uses unwrap() on line 100 - can system configuration issues (invalid TLS setup, DNS resolver failures) cause this to panic and crash the node checker? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: get_api_client()] [Build Unwrap Panic] The ClientBuilder::new().build() uses unwrap() on line 112 - is this panic-safe if system resources are exhausted or TLS initialization fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Error Context Leakage] The error context on line 133 includes the full URL - if the URL contains sensitive data (credentials, internal hostnames), does this leak in logs or error messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Function: as_noise_network_address()] [Warning Log Injection] The aptos_logger::warn! on line 143-147 includes socket_addrs which could be attacker-controlled - can an attacker inject newlines or format strings to corrupt logs or inject false warnings? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Deserialization Attack] The struct derives Deserialize - can an attacker provide malicious serialized data with invalid URLs, extreme port numbers, or crafted public keys to cause panics or exploits during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Cookie Store Skipping] The cookie_store is marked with #[serde(skip)] - when a NodeAddress is deserialized, it won't have the cookie_store from the original object. Can this cause null pointer dereferences or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Serialization State Loss] Since cookie_store is skipped during serialization, any authentication state is lost when NodeAddress is serialized/deserialized - can this cause authentication failures or require re-authentication that breaks workflows? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Public Key Deserialization] When deserializing public_key: Option<x25519::PublicKey>, is the key validated? Can an attacker provide a serialized invalid key that passes deserialization but fails cryptographically later? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Clone Race Condition] The struct derives Clone - if multiple threads clone and modify NodeAddress concurrently, can this cause data races on the shared Arc<Jar> cookie_store? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/node-checker/src/configuration/node_address.rs] [Struct: NodeAddress] [Arc<Jar> Thread Safety] Is reqwest::cookie::Jar thread-safe? If not, can concurrent requests through get_metrics_client() and get_api_client() cause data corruption in the cookie store? (High)"
