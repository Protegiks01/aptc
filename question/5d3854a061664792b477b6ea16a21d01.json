  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/network_config.rs] [Function: Peer::extend()] [Address Deduplication] At line 494, addresses are extended without deduplication - can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by repeatedly extending with duplicate addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/network_config.rs] [Function: Peer::extend()] [Key Set Merging] When keys are extended at line 495, can conflicting public keys for the same peer create authentication ambiguities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/network_config.rs] [Function: Peer::from_addrs()] [Public Key Extraction] At lines 500-503, keys are extracted from addresses - can addresses without embedded keys create peers with empty keysets that bypass authentication? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/network_config.rs] [Struct: PeerRole] [Default Role Security] PeerRole defaults to Unknown (line 442) - can uninitialized peer configs be exploited to gain untrusted peers higher privileges than intended? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/network_config.rs] [Function: discovery_methods()] [Backward Compatibility Bug] The backward compatibility logic at lines 219-228 returns discovery_method if not None - can this override intended discovery_methods, causing validators to connect to wrong networks? (High)",
