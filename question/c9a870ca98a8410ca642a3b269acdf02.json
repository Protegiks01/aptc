  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Duplicate Events] Is there a mechanism to prevent duplicate burn events with identical TokenId and amount from being emitted for the same transaction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Atomic Emission] If a transaction burns multiple tokens, are all BurnTokenEvents emitted atomically, or can partial emissions occur on transaction failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Event Suppression] Can malicious contracts suppress burn event emission while still executing the burn, causing supply tracking discrepancies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Deterministic Serialization] Does the Serialize implementation produce deterministic output across different platforms and Rust versions, preventing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: Serialize] [Size Limits] Are there bounds on the serialized size of BurnTokenEvent to prevent storage bloat attacks through extremely large events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: Deserialize] [Backward Compatibility] If the BurnTokenEvent structure is upgraded, can old serialized events still be deserialized without corruption or data loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: Debug] [Information Leakage] Does the Debug implementation expose sensitive information that could aid attackers in crafting exploit payloads? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Module Name Spoofing] Can attackers create events with MODULE_NAME='token' that masquerade as legitimate burn events but execute different logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: MoveStructType] [Struct Name Collision] If multiple modules define BurnTokenEvent, how does the system distinguish between them, and can this cause cross-contract confusion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Constant: MODULE_NAME] [Immutability] Is MODULE_NAME truly immutable at runtime, or could unsafe code or memory corruption change it to redirect event processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Constant: STRUCT_NAME] [Type Safety] Does the STRUCT_NAME='BurnTokenEvent' prevent type confusion with similarly named events like 'BurnEvent' or 'TokenBurnEvent'? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Version Compatibility] Does MoveEventV1Type properly isolate from V2 events, or can attackers trigger V1 processing for V2 events to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Trait: MoveEventV1Type] [Event Handler Injection] Can the MoveEventV1Type implementation be overridden or hooked to intercept burn events before they're processed? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Static: BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE] [Lazy Initialization] Is the Lazy initialization of BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE thread-safe, or can race conditions cause multiple initializations with different values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Static: BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE] [Address Validation] Does BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE use TOKEN_ADDRESS correctly, or can it be manipulated to point to a different module address? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Static: BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE] [Type Args Injection] The type_args field is empty - can attackers inject generic type arguments to create specialized burn events that bypass type checking? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Static: BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE] [Memory Safety] Is the Box::new(StructTag) allocation safe from memory leaks if initialization fails or panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Static: BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE] [Clone Attack] Can attackers clone BURN_TOKEN_EVENT_TYPE and modify the clone to create forged event types that pass type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Reentrancy] If burn events trigger callbacks, can a malicious contract re-enter the burn function before the first burn completes, causing double-counting? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Cross-Module Calls] Can events from other modules trigger BurnTokenEvent emission, and if so, are there access controls to prevent unauthorized burns? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Privilege Escalation] Can a non-privileged contract emit BurnTokenEvent to appear as if system-level burns occurred, bypassing governance controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Supply Underflow] If burn events are processed before verifying sufficient supply exists, can the total supply underflow and wrap to u64::MAX? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Orphaned Events] If a burn transaction reverts but the event was already emitted, can this cause permanent supply tracking inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/account_config/events/burn_token_event.rs] [Struct: BurnTokenEvent] [Event vs State Mismatch] Can the on-chain token balance differ from the amount indicated in burn events due to processing delays or failures? (High)",
