  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: unit_test_extensions_hook()] [Context Mutation] Can exts.add() calls mutate the NativeContextExtensions in a way that affects subsequent native function calls, creating hidden dependencies between tests? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Function: unit_test_extensions_hook()] [Memory Safety] Are all the contexts added via exts.add() properly cleaned up after tests, or can memory leaks, dangling references, or use-after-free bugs occur in test infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integration] [Native Registration Order] Can the order of native function registration in aptos_natives_with_builder() affect precedence, allowing later-registered natives to shadow earlier ones and enabling malicious override of critical functions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integration] [Gas Consistency] Are gas parameters in aptos_natives() consistent with those used in genesis, validator configuration, and transaction validation, or can parameter mismatches cause gas calculation divergence across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integration] [Feature Flag Sync] Can desynchronization between Features, TimedFeatures, and on-chain feature flags cause some validators to execute natives differently, leading to state divergence and consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integration] [Version Mismatch] If gas_feature_version is inconsistent across validators due to delayed upgrades, can this cause non-deterministic gas calculations and state root mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integration] [Builder Reuse] Can SafeNativeBuilder instances be reused across multiple VM instantiations, and does this create shared mutable state that could lead to race conditions in multi-threaded execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Module Boundary] [Import Safety] Are all imported native modules (aptos_framework, aptos_table_natives) properly validated to prevent malicious natives from being injected through dependency confusion or supply chain attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Module Boundary] [Circular Dependencies] Can circular dependencies between natives.rs, aptos_vm.rs, and framework natives create initialization ordering issues where natives are called before proper initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Memory Safety] [Unsafe Blocks] Does the file contain any unsafe blocks or unsafe trait implementations that could lead to memory corruption, use-after-free, or undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Memory Safety] [Reference Lifetime] Are all references passed to native function builders guaranteed to outlive the native function table, or can dangling references occur if gas parameters are dropped prematurely? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Concurrency] [Arc/Mutex] Does the SafeNativeBuilder use proper synchronization primitives if accessed from multiple threads, or can data races occur during native function registration? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Error Handling] [Panic Safety] Can any function panic without proper cleanup, leaving the VM in an inconsistent state or causing validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Error Handling] [Result Unwrapping] Are all Result types properly handled without unwrap() or expect() calls that could cause panics on unexpected errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Integer Arithmetic] [Overflow] Can gas_feature_version parameter cause integer overflow when used as an array index or in arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Deployment] [Feature Compilation] Can the #[cfg(feature = 'testing')] conditional compilation be bypassed through cargo feature manipulation, environment variables, or build system exploits to include test code in production binaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Deployment] [Binary Patching] Can production binaries be patched to re-enable test natives, remove assert_no_test_natives() checks, or modify gas parameters without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Deployment] [Reproducible Builds] Are native function tables deterministically constructed across different build environments, or can compiler optimizations, LLVM versions, or target architectures affect native registration order or behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Configuration] [Parameter Loading] How are NativeGasParameters and MiscGasParameters loaded from on-chain config, and can attackers manipulate these parameters during reconfiguration events to cause gas calculation divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Configuration] [Feature Activation] Can TimedFeatures be activated at different times on different validators, creating temporary state divergence windows that could be exploited for double-spending or consensus attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Configuration] [Default Values] Does Features::default() provide secure defaults for all feature flags, or can default-on features enable dangerous behavior that should require explicit activation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Testing] [Test Coverage] Does the test infrastructure adequately validate that all production natives are properly gas-metered, or can natives with missing gas charges pass tests but cause DoS in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Testing] [Mock Divergence] Can differences between DUMMY_RESOLVER behavior and real storage resolvers cause tests to pass while production code fails, hiding critical bugs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Testing] [Race Conditions] Does the test infrastructure properly simulate concurrent native function calls, or can single-threaded tests hide race conditions that occur in production's parallel execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/natives.rs] [Validation] [Runtime Checks] Beyond assert_no_test_natives(), are there runtime checks to validate that gas parameters are within expected ranges, preventing validators from running with misconfigured parameters? (High)"
