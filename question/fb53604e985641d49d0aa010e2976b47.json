  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Dependency: Constant-time guarantees] Does curve25519_dalek guarantee constant-time operations for all functions used by Curve25519 (add, sub, mul), or can certain code paths leak timing information? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Dependency: Feature flags] Are any unsafe or non-constant-time feature flags enabled in curve25519_dalek that could compromise the security of ElGamal operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Dependency: Supply chain] Has the curve25519_dalek dependency been verified for supply chain attacks (backdoored releases, malicious maintainers), given its critical role in ElGamal encryption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: Group structure] Does Curve25519 properly implement the cyclic group structure required for ElGamal, or can group operation failures enable attacks that break the discrete logarithm assumption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: Discrete logarithm] Is the discrete logarithm problem over Curve25519 hard for practical values used in veiled coins (e.g., encrypted amounts up to 2^64), or can baby-step giant-step attacks solve small values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: DDH assumption] Does ElGamal over Curve25519 rely on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption, and are there any known attacks that break DDH for this curve? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: Cofactor] Does the implementation properly handle Curve25519's cofactor of 8, and can the cofactor enable small subgroup confinement attacks on ElGamal ciphertexts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: Point compression] When points are compressed and decompressed, can the sign bit ambiguity enable attacks where the same ciphertext decrypts to two different plaintexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Math: Twist security] Is Curve25519's twist secure, and can an attacker send twisted points that get accepted as valid EdwardsPoints, enabling invalid curve attacks on ElGamal? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Edge case: Empty RNG] What happens if rand_scalar() is called with an RNG that has no entropy, and can this cause predictable scalar generation that breaks ElGamal key generation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Edge case: Maximum scalar] Can generator_mul() handle the maximum scalar value (curve order - 1), or does this cause overflow/wraparound that produces an incorrect public key? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Edge case: Repeated operations] Can repeated add() or sub() operations on the same points cause numerical instability or accumulation errors that break ElGamal ciphertext integrity? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Error handling: Invalid inputs] If any function receives an invalid input (null point, corrupted scalar), does it return a safe error or can it cause undefined behavior that crashes validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Error handling: Propagation] Are errors from curve25519_dalek operations properly propagated to callers, or can silent failures cause incorrect ElGamal encryption/decryption without detection? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Completeness: rand_element] The trait provides a default rand_element() implementation that calls generator_mul(rand_scalar()) - is this sufficient, or should Curve25519 override it for better security/performance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Correctness: Test coverage] The test module only has a basic keygen-enc-dec test - is this sufficient to catch all edge cases, or can cryptographic vulnerabilities remain undetected due to insufficient testing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/elgamal/curve25519.rs] [Correctness: Audit status] Has the Curve25519 implementation been formally audited by cryptographic experts, and are there any known issues or recommendations from past audits? (High)"
