  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Transaction Version Manipulation] Can an attacker provide transactions with non-sequential or duplicate version numbers that bypass the start_version/end_version validation, causing database constraint violations or state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Integer Overflow] Can extremely large transaction version numbers (approaching u64::MAX) in the transactions vector cause integer overflow when calculating indices or performing version arithmetic operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Race Condition] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability where concurrent calls to process_transactions() with overlapping version ranges could cause duplicate inserts or inconsistent database state despite transaction isolation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Data Corruption] Can malformed Transaction objects with inconsistent internal state (e.g., UserTransaction with BlockMetadataTransaction data) cause the indexer to write corrupted data that permanently breaks the database schema? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker submit a transaction batch where TransactionModel::from_transactions() generates millions of events, signatures, or write set changes, exhausting memory before the chunking logic in insert_to_db() takes effect? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [State Inconsistency] If from_transactions() partially fails or returns incomplete data for some transactions, does the code detect and rollback, or does it proceed to insert partial transaction data causing permanent state inconsistency?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Type Confusion] Can crafted transactions with mismatched TransactionDetail types (claiming UserTransaction but containing BlockMetadata) bypass the match statement at lines 493-501 and corrupt the signatures/user_transactions vectors?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [HashMap Collision Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions with colliding (table_handle, key_hash) pairs that fill the current_table_items HashMap, causing O(n) lookup performance degradation and DoS? (Medium)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Transaction Type Filter Bypass] Can transactions that are neither UserTransaction nor BlockMetadataTransaction (line 542) bypass object extraction logic, causing objects to not be indexed and breaking chain state visibility?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/processors/default_processor.rs] [Function: process_transactions()] [Error Handling Bypass] If insert_to_db() returns Err at line 611, does the error properly propagate all transaction versions, or can partial version ranges be lost in the TransactionProcessingError construction?
