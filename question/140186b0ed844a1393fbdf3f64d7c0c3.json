  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Serialization of None values] If system information contains None/null values, how are they serialized to JSON, and could this cause parsing issues in monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Consensus impact] Since collecting system information via refresh_system() and refresh_disks() is expensive, can repeated calls to this endpoint during critical consensus rounds cause validator performance degradation affecting block proposal timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Thread contention] Does this function run on the same thread pool as consensus or other critical operations, and could high request volume cause thread starvation affecting network liveness? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: handle_system_information_request()] [Constant manipulation] Are the constants SYS_INFO_DISABLED_MESSAGE (line 10-11), CONTENT_TYPE_JSON, and CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT immutable and validated to prevent runtime modification or injection attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/system_information.rs] [Function: get_system_information_json()] [Locale handling] Does system information include locale-specific data that could vary based on system locale settings, potentially leaking timezone information or geographic location of validator nodes? (Low)"
