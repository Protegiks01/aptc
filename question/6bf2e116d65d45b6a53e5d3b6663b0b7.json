  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Tests] [Test coverage gaps] The tests at lines 109-233 cover optimize() scenarios but don't test sanitize() with various authentication_configs - are there untested edge cases in authentication validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Tests] [Missing negative tests] Do tests verify that sanitize() properly rejects empty authentication_configs on mainnet, or only test the happy path? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Tests] [Randomization testing] Does test coverage include randomize_ports() to ensure it doesn't select reserved or conflicting ports? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [IPv6 support] Does the address field properly support IPv6 addresses like [::1] or [::]? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: address] [Hostname resolution] If address is a hostname instead of IP, does DNS resolution happen securely without TOCTOU vulnerabilities or DNS rebinding attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: authentication_configs] [Empty string hash] Can PasscodeSha256 contain an empty string or the SHA256 of an empty string, effectively allowing authentication with no password? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/admin_service_config.rs] [Field: authentication_configs] [Duplicate hashes] Can authentication_configs contain duplicate PasscodeSha256 hashes, and does this cause any logical issues or bypass conditions? (Low)"
