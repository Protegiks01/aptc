  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: LogicalTime] [Integer overflow] Can the epoch or round fields in LogicalTime overflow when incremented repeatedly across many epochs, potentially causing epoch/round comparison logic to fail and break consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: LogicalTime] [Ordering violation] Does the PartialOrd implementation for LogicalTime correctly handle cases where epoch increases but round decreases, or could malicious validators exploit incorrect ordering to commit blocks out of order? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: LogicalTime::new()] [Validation bypass] Are there any validation checks on the epoch and round parameters passed to LogicalTime::new(), or can attackers create LogicalTime instances with arbitrary values (e.g., u64::MAX) to manipulate logical time comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: LogicalTime] [Hash collision] Could the Hash implementation for LogicalTime lead to collisions if epoch and round values are crafted specifically, potentially causing issues in data structures that rely on LogicalTime as keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Validator list manipulation] Can the validators Arc<[AccountAddress]> be manipulated during epoch transitions to include unauthorized validators, potentially allowing Byzantine nodes to participate in consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Payload manager tampering] Is there any validation that the payload_manager passed to MutableState is authentic and hasn't been swapped with a malicious implementation that could inject invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Config manipulation] Can block_executor_onchain_config be modified after MutableState creation to change execution parameters mid-epoch, potentially causing state divergence between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Randomness flag tampering] Can the is_randomness_enabled flag be toggled to disable randomness features during an epoch, potentially enabling predictable validator selection or other attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Version rollback] Could persisted_auxiliary_info_version be set to an older version to cause validators to use outdated auxiliary data formats, leading to state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: MutableState] [Deduper bypass] Can transaction_deduper be replaced with a no-op implementation that allows duplicate transactions to be executed, potentially enabling replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: ExecutionProxy] [Executor injection] Is the executor Arc<dyn BlockExecutorTrait> validated during construction to ensure it's not a malicious implementation that could manipulate execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: ExecutionProxy] [Notifier bypass] Can txn_notifier or state_sync_notifier be null/no-op implementations that silently drop notifications, causing other components to miss critical events? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: ExecutionProxy] [Mutex initialization] Is the write_mutex AsyncMutex initialized with LogicalTime(0,0) safe, or could this allow operations before proper epoch initialization, leading to state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: ExecutionProxy] [State initialization] Does the RwLock<Option<MutableState>> being initialized to None create a window where operations could fail or panic if called before new_epoch()? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Struct: ExecutionProxy] [Pre-commit flag] Can the enable_pre_commit flag be toggled at runtime, or could it be set inconsistently across validators, causing some to pre-commit while others don't, leading to state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new()] [Missing validation] Does ExecutionProxy::new() validate that executor, txn_notifier, and state_sync_notifier are non-null and properly initialized, or could null/invalid trait objects cause panics later? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new()] [Config validation] Are the BlockTransactionFilterConfig parameters validated to prevent malicious configurations (e.g., filter all transactions, allow invalid transactions)? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: new()] [Arc sharing] Could the Arc-wrapped components be shared with untrusted code that might mutate internal state through interior mutability, breaking invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [Uninitialized state panic] Does pipeline_builder() properly handle the case where state.read().as_ref() returns None (before new_epoch() is called), or does the .expect() cause a panic that could halt consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [TOCTOU race] Is there a race condition between state.read() and the cloning of MutableState fields, where state could be cleared by end_epoch() mid-operation, causing inconsistent pipeline configuration? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [Validator list race] Can validators be modified between being read from MutableState and being passed to PipelineBuilder::new(), potentially allowing unauthorized validators into the pipeline? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [Commit signer validation] Is the commit_signer ValidatorSigner validated to ensure it corresponds to the current validator set, or could an attacker pass a signer for a different validator? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [Component cloning] Do the Arc::clone() operations preserve all security properties, or could shared mutable state in the cloned components lead to cross-pipeline interference? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [BlockPreparer injection] Is the BlockPreparer constructed securely, or could malicious payload_manager/transaction_deduper/transaction_shuffler implementations inject invalid transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/state_computer.rs] [Function: pipeline_builder()] [Config tampering] Can block_executor_onchain_config be modified between being read and being passed to PipelineBuilder, causing the pipeline to use inconsistent execution parameters? (High)"
