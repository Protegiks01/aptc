  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Early return exploit] Can an attacker manipulate num_subscriptions_to_create to be 0 to prevent new subscriptions from being created even when needed? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Task panic handling] If the spawned tokio task panics, is the panic properly caught and logged, or does it silently fail leaving active_subscription_creation_task in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Lock holding] Does cloning all state (active_observer_subscriptions, clients, etc.) before spawning avoid holding locks during async operations, or can long-running tasks cause deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Resource cleanup] If a subscription creation task is interrupted or cancelled, are partially created subscriptions properly cleaned up, or do they leak resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [State cloning] Can the Arc cloning of shared state cause reference count overflows with many rapid subscription changes, potentially causing memory corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Async task ordering] Can new subscriptions be added to active_observer_subscriptions before they are fully initialized, causing race conditions in concurrent health checks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Terminated peer resubscription] Can the terminated_subscription_peers list be manipulated to force resubscription to malicious peers that were just terminated for bad behavior? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Warning suppression] Does the warning log for failed subscription creation get rate-limited, or can it be spammed to hide more critical issues in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: spawn_subscription_creation_task()] [Metrics race] Can update_subscription_change_metrics() be called concurrently with other metric updates, causing inconsistent or corrupt metrics data? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_all_subscriptions()] [Incomplete termination] If unsubscribe_from_peer() fails for some peers, does terminate_all_subscriptions() still remove them from active subscriptions, causing unclean state? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_all_subscriptions()] [Race with creation] Can terminate_all_subscriptions() race with spawn_subscription_creation_task(), where new subscriptions are added while termination is in progress? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_all_subscriptions()] [Resource leak] Are all async unsubscribe tasks properly awaited or do they become orphaned, potentially leaking network connections or memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_all_subscriptions()] [Lock duration] Does iterating over all subscriptions while holding the lock cause prolonged lock holding, enabling DoS through lock contention? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Skip optimization bypass] Can the skip_peer_optimality_check logic be exploited to prevent termination of all unhealthy subscriptions if the first one is unhealthy, allowing bad peers to persist? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Order dependency] Does the order of subscription termination matter, and can an attacker manipulate peer ordering to keep priority peers from being checked for health? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Error accumulation] Can accumulated errors in terminated_subscriptions grow unbounded, causing memory issues if subscriptions are frequently churning? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Partial termination] If the function terminates multiple subscriptions, but subscription creation fails, does this leave the observer with insufficient subscriptions and degraded performance? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Concurrent modification] Can concurrent calls to terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions() cause the same subscription to be terminated multiple times, causing panics or double-free errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: terminate_unhealthy_subscriptions()] [Health check bypass] Can check_subscription_health() be forced to return Ok() for unhealthy subscriptions through manipulation of skip_peer_optimality_check or stale metadata? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Double unsubscribe] Can unsubscribe_from_peer() be called multiple times for the same peer concurrently, causing multiple unsubscribe RPCs or double removal from the HashMap? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Async task leak] Since the unsubscribe RPC is spawned asynchronously without awaiting, can a large number of pending unsubscribe tasks exhaust the tokio runtime or system resources? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Response validation] Does the function properly validate ConsensusObserverResponse::UnsubscribeAck, or can a malicious peer send fake acks without actually unsubscribing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Timeout handling] If send_rpc_request_to_peer() times out, is the subscription still considered terminated locally, causing state desynchronization between observer and peer? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Error logging bypass] Can warning logs for failed unsubscribe requests be suppressed or filtered by attackers to hide evidence of malicious behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/src/consensus_observer/observer/subscription_manager.rs] [Function: unsubscribe_from_peer()] [Network partition] If unsubscribe_from_peer() is called during a network partition, does the peer continue sending messages, causing InvalidMessageError spam and log pollution?
