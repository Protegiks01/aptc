  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Code Generation] Can malicious code in the documentation generation pipeline (invoked at lines 13, 18, 23) generate Move source code or Rust code that gets compiled into the final binary, creating backdoors in validator software? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment Variable Injection] Can an attacker manipulate environment variables used by the path functions (invoked indirectly at lines 11, 13, etc.) to redirect file operations to attacker-controlled locations, enabling documentation or error map replacement? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Working Directory Confusion] If the current working directory is changed by an attacker before main() executes, can relative paths used by the documentation generation functions at lines 13, 18, 23 resolve to unintended locations? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Privilege Escalation] If this build script runs with elevated privileges (e.g., during system package installation), can the file deletion operations at lines 11, 17, 22 be exploited to delete system files or escalate privileges? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Timing Side Channel] Can the timing information printed by time_it() at lines 10, 16, 21 leak information about the structure or size of Move source code, potentially revealing private development details in confidential forks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Information Disclosure] Can error messages from the documentation generation at lines 13, 18, 23 leak sensitive information about the build environment, file paths, or internal code structure that could aid attackers in planning supply chain attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Parallel Build Race] Can multiple concurrent invocations of main() (e.g., in parallel build systems) cause race conditions when accessing shared filesystem resources, resulting in corrupted documentation or error maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Lock File Absence] Does the build process lack proper locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent execution of main(), potentially leading to race conditions between remove operations (lines 11, 17, 22) and build operations (lines 13, 18, 23)? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Silent Failure] Can critical errors in the documentation or error map generation be silently ignored due to unwrap_or(()) at lines 11, 17, 22, causing the build to proceed with incomplete or corrupted outputs that mislead developers? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Partial State] If the process is killed between line 11 (remove_dir_all) and line 13 (build_stdlib_doc), can this leave the codebase in a state with no documentation, causing confusion or build failures in dependent components? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Error Recovery] If build_stdlib_doc() at line 13 fails but the subsequent operations at lines 16-24 succeed, can this create an inconsistent build artifact where some documentation exists but other parts are missing? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Malicious Move Code] Can malicious Move source code with infinite loops or recursive structures cause the documentation generation at line 13 to hang indefinitely, preventing builds and blocking critical validator software updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Move Parser Exploit] Can specially crafted Move source files exploit parser vulnerabilities during documentation generation at line 13, causing buffer overflows or code execution in the build process? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Unicode Attacks] Can Move source files with malicious Unicode characters (e.g., homoglyphs, right-to-left override) cause the documentation generator at line 13 to produce misleading documentation that hides malicious code intent? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Output Integrity] Can the absence of checksums or signatures on the generated documentation (line 13) and error maps (line 23) allow an attacker to modify these files post-generation without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Determinism Failure] Can non-deterministic elements in the documentation generation (timestamps, random seeds) at lines 13, 18, 23 cause different outputs for the same input, breaking reproducible build verification used for supply chain security? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Output Sanitization] Does the documentation generation at line 13 properly sanitize Move source code content, or can malicious code comments inject shell commands or path traversal sequences into documentation files? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Disk Space Exhaustion] Can malicious Move source files cause the documentation generation at line 13 to produce extremely large output files, exhausting disk space and causing build failures or preventing validator operations? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Build Cache Poisoning] If the documentation generation uses caching mechanisms, can an attacker poison the cache to cause subsequent builds to use malicious documentation or error maps without regenerating them? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [File Handle Exhaustion] Can the documentation generation process at line 13 fail to properly close file handles, causing resource exhaustion in long-running build processes that could prevent validator software compilation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-stdlib/src/main.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Injection] Can special characters or escape sequences in Move module names be used to inject malicious paths during documentation generation at line 13, causing files to be written outside the intended directory? (Medium)"
