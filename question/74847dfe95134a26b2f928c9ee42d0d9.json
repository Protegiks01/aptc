  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: vote_to_string()] [Type confusion] Can the boolean input be manipulated or spoofed when called from external contexts to misrepresent vote outcomes in governance displays? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: vote_to_string()] [Information disclosure] Does the static string return create any timing side-channels that could leak vote information before official tallying is complete? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: vote_to_string()] [Logic error] Are there any edge cases where vote boolean values could be misinterpreted due to Rust's type system, potentially causing vote inversion in governance decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Voting power manipulation] Can an attacker provide a specified_voting_power value equal to u64::MAX to manipulate the comparison at line 21, potentially bypassing voting power limits and gaining unauthorized voting influence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Integer overflow] Does the comparison at line 21 handle edge cases where specified_voting_power equals u64::MAX or u64::MIN, potentially causing integer overflow or underflow in subsequent voting power calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Logic bypass] Can an attacker exploit the condition at line 21 by providing specified_voting_power exactly equal to remaining_voting_power to avoid the warning message while maximizing their voting power beyond intended limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Information disclosure] Does the println! statement at lines 22-24 leak sensitive voting power information to stdout that could be monitored by malicious validators to gain strategic advantages in governance votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Race condition] If check_remaining_voting_power() is called concurrently for the same stake pool, can race conditions cause multiple voters to claim the same voting power, leading to double-voting and governance manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Voting power theft] Can an attacker call this function multiple times with different specified_voting_power values to probe and extract the maximum available voting power without proper authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [State inconsistency] Does the function properly synchronize with on-chain voting power state, or can stale remaining_voting_power values lead to voting power being consumed multiple times across different proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Economic attack] Can an attacker repeatedly call this function with Some(0) to cause denial of service through excessive println! calls, degrading validator performance during critical governance windows? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Validation bypass] Does passing None for specified_voting_power at line 20 bypass any intended voting power limits, allowing users to always vote with their full stake regardless of governance rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Type safety] Can the Option<u64> parameter be exploited through unsafe unwrapping in calling code to cause panics during critical governance voting periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Arithmetic error] Does the assignment at line 27 properly handle the case where specified_voting_power is 0, potentially allowing zero-voting-power votes that could manipulate voting quorum calculations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Business logic flaw] Can validators exploit the warning-only behavior at lines 22-24 to vote with more power than they have by ignoring the warning, causing governance vote count inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Time-of-check-time-of-use] Is there a TOCTOU vulnerability where remaining_voting_power changes between the comparison at line 21 and the assignment at line 27, allowing double-spending of voting power? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Access control] Does this function verify that the caller is authorized to use the specified voting power, or can any account invoke it to claim voting power from arbitrary stake pools? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Precision loss] Can extremely large u64 values near the maximum cause precision issues or unexpected behavior in the comparison logic that could be exploited to manipulate voting outcomes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Reentrancy] If this function is called as part of a governance transaction, can reentrancy attacks allow multiple withdrawals of the same voting power before state is updated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Delegation abuse] Can delegated voting power be double-counted by calling this function separately for the delegator and delegatee, effectively doubling voting influence on proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Quorum manipulation] Can attackers provide specific specified_voting_power values that, when aggregated across multiple callers, manipulate quorum calculations to pass or fail proposals improperly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Error handling] What happens if remaining_voting_power is 0 but specified_voting_power is Some(non-zero)? Can this edge case be exploited to create invalid voting states? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Consensus divergence] If different validators process this function with slightly different remaining_voting_power values due to state inconsistencies, can it cause consensus failures on governance proposal outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Front-running] Can malicious validators observe transactions calling this function in the mempool and front-run them to consume voting power first, preventing legitimate voters from participating? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/governance/utils.rs] [Function: check_remaining_voting_power()] [Staking manipulation] Can attackers temporarily inflate their stake, call this function to lock in high voting power, then withdraw stake before the vote completes, allowing voting without economic commitment?
