  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Prune Window Lower Bound] The ledger_prune_window check at line 648 only warns but doesn't error - can validators intentionally run with windows <50M to harm data availability without being rejected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [State Merkle Critical Threshold] The state_merkle_prune_window warning at line 651 only warns at <100K - should this be an error since the comment states 'node might stop functioning'? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Epoch Snapshot Warning] The epoch_snapshot_prune_window warning at line 654 - can this be set to 0 to completely disable epoch snapshots, breaking fast sync for all new nodes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [User Offset Hard Limit] The user_pruning_window_offset hard limit at lines 657-661 rejects values >1M - is this threshold appropriate, or can legitimate use cases require larger offsets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Offset Exceeds Window] The check at lines 663-667 that user_pruning_window_offset must not exceed ledger_prune_window - can this validation be bypassed through integer overflow if both values are near u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Sharding Requirement] The validation at lines 671-675 requires sharding to be enabled for db_path_overrides - can this be bypassed by temporarily enabling sharding, setting overrides, then disabling sharding? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Ledger Path Validation] The ledger_db_path validation at lines 678-686 checks is_absolute() - can Windows UNC paths, network paths, or device paths bypass this check? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [State Merkle Path Validation] The state_merkle_db_path validation at lines 704-718 - is this duplicated validation code creating inconsistencies compared to state_kv_db_path validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Function: ConfigSanitizer::sanitize()] [Missing Hot Path Validation] There is no validation for hot_state_kv_db_path overrides - can this be exploited to configure invalid hot storage paths? (High)",

(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Constant: BUFFERED_STATE_TARGET_ITEMS] [Production Default] The default of 100,000 items at line 28 - can this cause excessive memory usage during high-TPS periods, and should it be dynamically adjusted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Constant: BUFFERED_STATE_TARGET_ITEMS_FOR_TEST] [Test Leakage] Can the test-only value of 10 at line 29 accidentally be used in production, causing constant state dumps and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Default: RocksdbConfig] [Default Max Open Files] The default max_open_files of 5000 at line 169 - can this be insufficient for validators processing high TPS, causing 'too many open files' errors? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Default: RocksdbConfig] [Default Background Jobs] The default of 4 background jobs at line 174 - is this optimal for modern many-core systems, or can this bottleneck compaction? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/config/src/config/storage_config.rs] [Default: RocksdbConfigs] [Default Block Cache] The 24GB default block cache at line 212 - can this cause OOM on systems with less RAM, and is there runtime validation of available memory? (High)",
