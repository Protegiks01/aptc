  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Deterministic Output] Is the serialization output deterministic for signature verification purposes, or can the same logical manifest produce different byte representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Dependency Verification] Are there integrity checks (signatures, hashes) for dependencies fetched via git/local/aptos sources, or can compromised sources go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Privilege Escalation] Can crafted manifests with system addresses in the addresses field (line 16) be used to deploy packages that impersonate core framework modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Transitive Trust] If a trusted package has a dependency with a malicious address override (line 81), can the malicious code gain the trust level of the parent package? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Dev Mode Bypass] Can dev-addresses or dev-dependencies be accidentally included in production builds, granting development-only permissions in production environments? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Empty Manifest] What happens if all BTreeMaps (addresses, dev_addresses, dependencies, dev_dependencies) are empty - does this create an invalid but deserializable state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Empty Strings] Can name, version, or license fields be empty strings, causing downstream logic errors in package identification or version comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Empty Authors] What happens if the authors vector is empty - does this violate any package system invariants about package ownership? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [All None] Can a Dependency exist with all optional fields set to None, creating a valid but meaningless dependency that causes null pointer errors in dependency resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::serialize()] [Zero Address] Does serializing a ManifestNamedAddress with AccountAddress 0x0 create any special interpretation or security bypass in address validation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Duplicate Names] Can addresses and dev-addresses contain the same key names, causing ambiguity about which address takes precedence during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Whitespace] Do dependency string fields properly trim whitespace, or can leading/trailing spaces in git URLs or paths bypass validation or cause file system errors? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Schema Evolution] If new fields are added to the manifest format in future versions, could old manifests deserialize into inconsistent states due to missing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Version Downgrade] Can attackers deploy package 'upgrades' with lower version numbers to rollback security fixes or bypass version-based access controls? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Backward Compatibility] If the manifest format changes, are there protections against manifests created with newer tools being misinterpreted by older validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Package Collision] Can two different packages with the same name but different addresses create namespace collisions that allow malicious package substitution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Circular Dependencies] Does the manifest format prevent circular dependencies, or can package A depending on B and B depending on A cause infinite loops during compilation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Manifest Injection] During package publication, can attackers inject modified manifests that differ from the original source manifest, causing published packages to have different dependencies than intended? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Missing Validation] Are there any semantic validation checks after deserialization (e.g., verifying addresses are valid, dependencies are reachable), or does the code trust serde validation alone? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: Dependency] [Mutually Exclusive Fields] Is there validation ensuring only one of (local, git, aptos) is set per Dependency, or can multiple sources cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: PackageInfo] [Name Format] Does the package name follow any format restrictions (alphanumeric, no special chars), or can arbitrary strings including control characters be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Recursive Validation] If load_manifest_account_arg performs profile lookups, can recursive profile references cause infinite loops or stack overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Function: ManifestNamedAddress::deserialize()] [Error Messages] Does the unwrap() on line 62 provide meaningful error messages for debugging, or does it create confusing panic messages that hide the actual validation failure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Partial Deserialization] If deserialization fails halfway through a large manifest, are there any cleanup mechanisms to prevent partial state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/move_tool/manifest.rs] [Struct: MovePackageManifest] [Recovery Path] If a manifest is detected as malicious after partial processing, is there a safe rollback mechanism, or could partial state persist and affect subsequent operations? (Medium)"
