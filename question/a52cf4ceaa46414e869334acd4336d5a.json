  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum: InputOutputKey] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker craft transactions that exploit the distinction between Resource, Group, and DelayedField variants to bypass conflict detection by mapping the same underlying resource to different enum variants? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum: InputOutputKey] [Hash Collision] Does the Hash implementation for InputOutputKey properly distinguish between Resource(K) and Group(K, T) with the same key K, or can hash collisions allow conflicting transactions to appear non-conflicting in the HashSet, enabling double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum: InputOutputKey] [State Corruption] Can DelayedField IDs be manipulated or collide with Resource/Group keys in the HashSet, allowing delayed field operations to hide conflicts with regular resource accesses and corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum: InputOutputKey] [Equality Bypass] Does the PartialEq implementation properly compare all three variants (Resource, Group, DelayedField), or can an attacker construct keys that are equal when they shouldn't be, bypassing conflict detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Enum: InputOutputKey] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker create unbounded numbers of unique InputOutputKey variants (especially DelayedFieldID values) to exhaust validator memory in the HashSet storage, causing node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: ReadWriteSummary::new()] [Validation Missing] Does the constructor validate that reads and writes HashSets don't contain duplicate or malformed entries, or can attackers inject invalid InputOutputKey values that later cause conflict detection failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: ReadWriteSummary::new()] [State Inconsistency] Can an attacker construct ReadWriteSummary with overlapping reads and writes for the same key, violating transaction semantics and causing non-deterministic parallel execution results across validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: ReadWriteSummary::new()] [Memory DoS] Are there limits on the size of reads/writes HashSets passed to new(), or can malicious transactions create summaries with millions of entries to exhaust validator memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [False Negative] Does the is_disjoint() check properly handle all InputOutputKey variants, or can subtle hash collisions or type confusion allow conflicting transactions to return false from conflicts_with_previous(), enabling parallel execution of dependent transactions and double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [Race Condition] Is conflicts_with_previous() called atomically during parallel execution scheduling, or can race conditions allow two conflicting transactions to both check before the other's summary is registered, both returning false and executing in parallel? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [Asymmetric Detection] Does the logic correctly handle asymmetric conflicts (current reads what previous writes vs current writes what previous reads), or can Write-Write conflicts be missed since the method only checks reads.is_disjoint(writes)? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [DelayedField Exception] Are DelayedField accesses properly included in conflict detection, or can transactions manipulating delayed fields bypass conflicts_with_previous() checks and execute in parallel with conflicting non-delayed operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: conflicts_with_previous()] [Determinism Failure] Can non-deterministic HashSet iteration order cause different validators to detect conflicts in different orders, leading to divergent parallel execution schedules and state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: find_conflicts()] [Incomplete Results] Does find_conflicts() correctly return ALL conflicting keys via intersection(), or can HashSet implementation issues cause some conflicts to be silently dropped, leading to incorrect conflict resolution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: find_conflicts()] [Resource Leak] Does the returned HashSet from find_conflicts() get properly deallocated, or can repeated conflict detection leak memory references and eventually crash validators during high transaction load? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: find_conflicts()] [Performance Attack] Can an attacker craft transactions with massive read/write sets where intersection() becomes O(n²) expensive, causing validator CPU exhaustion and preventing block execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: find_conflicts()] [False Positive Exploitation] Can malicious validators report fake conflicts via find_conflicts() to force unnecessary transaction re-executions, degrading network performance or creating liveness issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [Information Loss] When collapsing Group(k, tag) to Resource(k), is the tag information properly preserved elsewhere, or can this cause fine-grained conflicts to be ignored, allowing concurrent modifications to different resources within the same group? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [Overly Conservative] Does collapsing all Group accesses to Resource level create false conflicts that prevent legitimate parallel execution, potentially reducing throughput or enabling griefing attacks that force sequential execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [DelayedField Preservation] Are DelayedField keys correctly preserved during collapse, or can the transformation accidentally convert DelayedField IDs to Resource keys, breaking delayed field semantics? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [Duplicate Key Creation] After collapsing, can multiple Group(k, tag1), Group(k, tag2) entries create duplicate Resource(k) entries in the HashSet, causing non-deterministic behavior or conflict detection failures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [Consumption Semantics] Does collapse consume self (taking ownership), and can this lead to use-after-move bugs if callers attempt to use the original ReadWriteSummary after collapse? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: collapse_resource_group_conflicts()] [Idempotency] Is collapse_resource_group_conflicts() idempotent, or can calling it multiple times on already-collapsed data cause further unintended transformations? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_written()] [DelayedField Omission] By filtering out DelayedField keys, does keys_written() cause delayed field modifications to be invisible to downstream state commitment logic, potentially causing Merkle tree inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/block-executor/src/types.rs] [Function: keys_read()] [Incomplete Dependency Tracking] Since keys_read() excludes DelayedFields, can transactions that depend on delayed field values be incorrectly scheduled in parallel, violating read-after-write dependencies? (Critical)"
