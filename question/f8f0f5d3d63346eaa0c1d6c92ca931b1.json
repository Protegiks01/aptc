  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Function: get_forge_metrics()] [Network timeout] The async function has no timeout - can a slow or malicious server cause the client to hang indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Function: get_forge_metrics()] [JSON parsing vulnerability] The response is parsed as HashMap<String, String> - can a malicious server provide deeply nested or malformed JSON to cause DoS? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Struct: MetricValue] [Enum exhaustiveness] The MetricValue enum has three variants - are all match statements exhaustive, or can new variants cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Function: to_i64()] [Error handling] Returns anyhow::Error with format_err - does this error message leak the actual metric value in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/inspection_client.rs] [Function: to_f64()] [Floating point precision] Converting i64 to f64 can lose precision for large values - can this cause incorrect metric interpretation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_all_metrics()] [Metric cardinality explosion] The function returns ALL metrics as a HashMap - if metrics have high cardinality (many label combinations), can this cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_encoded_metrics()] [Encoding failure handling] On encoding error, an empty vec![] is returned - can this cause downstream consumers to misinterpret missing metrics? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_encoded_metrics()] [Counter overflow] The function increments NUM_METRICS counters - can counter overflow cause incorrect metric reporting? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_metric_families()] [Logging DoS] Warns when metric families exceed 2000 dimensions - can an attacker cause metric cardinality explosion to flood logs with warnings? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_metrics_map()] [SUMMARY and UNTYPED handling] These metric types are unsupported and log errors - can an attacker register these metric types to flood error logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/utils.rs] [Function: get_metrics_map()] [Label formatting] Labels are formatted as name=value pairs - can special characters in label names or values break the format? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/json_encoder.rs] [Function: encode()] [Metric name flattening] The encoder converts metric{labels} to metric.label.values - can this cause name collisions if a metric name naturally contains dots? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/json_encoder.rs] [Function: encode()] [Histogram sample overflow] Histogram sample_count is cast to f64 - can extremely large sample counts lose precision or cause overflow? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/index.rs] [Function: handle_index_request()] [Endpoint enumeration] The index lists all available endpoints - does this help attackers discover all attack surfaces even if some endpoints are disabled? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-inspection-service/src/server/index.rs] [Function: get_index_response()] [Static endpoint list] The endpoint list is hardcoded - if new endpoints are added without updating this list, can attackers discover hidden endpoints? (Low)",
