  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Module level] [Bytecode validation bypass] If this module incorrectly approves invalid control flow graphs, could attackers deploy Move bytecode with infinite loops causing validator DoS during execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Module level] [Gas metering impact] If natural loops are computed incorrectly, could this cause gas calculations to underestimate loop costs, allowing DoS through under-priced execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Module level] [Consensus divergence] Could non-deterministic behavior in any graph algorithm cause different validators to accept/reject the same bytecode, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Module level] [Compiler optimization impact] If loop detection is wrong, could Move compiler optimizations be applied incorrectly leading to miscompiled smart contracts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Tests] [Missing panic tests] The test suite doesn't include tests for invalid inputs (empty graphs, missing nodes in edges) - could production code panic on these inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Tests] [No stress tests] Are there stress tests with very large graphs (millions of nodes) to verify no integer overflow or memory exhaustion occurs during deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Tests] [Edge case coverage] Do tests cover all edge cases like self-loops, disconnected nodes, single-node graphs that could appear in malicious bytecode? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Line 39-40] [Entry modification] Can edges.entry(edge.0) fail if edge.0 doesn't exist in the successors map initialized at lines 36-37, causing panic? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Line 42-43] [Entry modification] Similar to above, can edges.entry(edge.1) fail if edge.1 wasn't in the initial nodes vector, causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-model/bytecode/src/graph.rs] [Line 73] [Recursive graph creation] Creating a new Graph instance during compute_reducible - could this cause issues if the original graph has invalid state that gets propagated? (Medium)"
