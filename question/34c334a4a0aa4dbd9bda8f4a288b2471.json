  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Macro: serialize!] [Unwrap panic] The serialize! macro calls .unwrap() (line 44) which panics on error - does production serialization handle errors gracefully, or could serialization failures crash validators during consensus message processing? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/bench_utils.rs] [Function: bench_function_deser_comp] [Compressed deserialization without validation] The compressed deserialization (lines 32-45) calls unwrap() without validating the decompressed point - could production code deserialize invalid compressed points that pass initial checks but fail later during cryptographic operations? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/bench_utils.rs] [Function: bench_function_deser_uncomp] [Uncompressed deserialization size] The uncompressed deserialization (lines 48-61) doesn't show size validation - could an attacker send uncompressed points with extra trailing bytes that are silently ignored, causing different validators to deserialize different point values? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 101-107] [Mixed compression formats] G1 affine benchmarks include both compressed and uncompressed deserialization - does production code enforce a single canonical format, or could validators disagree on which format is valid, causing consensus failure? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 266-288] [G2 deserialization] G2 deserialization is more complex than G1 due to Fq2 coordinates - could the additional complexity introduce deserialization bugs that allow attackers to inject malicious public keys that appear valid to some validators but invalid to others? (Critical - $1M)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 49-519] [Benchmark code in production] If any benchmark code from bench_group function is accidentally included in production builds (e.g., through feature flags or conditional compilation), could the test_rng() usage compromise real cryptographic operations? (Critical - $1M)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 35-39] [rand! macro leakage] The rand! macro is defined globally in this benchmark module - could name collision or macro hygiene issues cause this macro to be used in production code instead of a cryptographically secure random number generator? (Critical - $1M)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 550-551] [Criterion configuration] The criterion configuration uses default settings - could benchmark results published publicly leak timing information about cryptographic operations that aids attackers in designing side-channel attacks? (Medium - $10K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 19] [test_rng dependency] The benchmark imports ark_std::test_rng which is explicitly for testing - are there CI/CD checks to ensure test_rng never appears in production code paths? (Critical - $1M)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 548-552] [Benchmark as documentation] If developers use these benchmarks as reference implementations for production code, could they copy vulnerable patterns like unwrap() usage, missing validation, or test RNG into security-critical paths? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 121-128] [Scalar zero] If rand!(Fr) generates zero as the scalar (possible with weak RNG), scalar multiplication should return infinity - does production code handle zero scalars correctly in all contexts (signature generation, key derivation)? (High - $50K)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/benches/ark_bn254.rs] [Lines 222-233] [Scalar equals curve order] If a scalar equals the curve order (should be reduced to zero), does production scalar multiplication detect this and return infinity, or could unreduced scalars cause incorrect cryptographic results? (High - $50K)"
