  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: seek_to_first()] [Status override] At line 51, does setting status to DoneSeek correctly handle the case where the previous status was Invalid, potentially allowing operations on invalid iterators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: seek_for_prev()] [Backward boundary] Does seek_for_prev() correctly handle seeking before the first key in the database, or can it return garbage data or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: next_impl()] [Status machine completeness] Are all possible Status enum variants handled in all code paths, or can adding new Status variants cause unhandled match arms? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Enum: ScanDirection] [Direction exhaustiveness] At line 12-15, are Forward and Backward the only valid scan directions, or can future additions break existing code assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Multi-component: Iterator + Codec] [Codec injection] Can an attacker craft database entries that exploit vulnerabilities in KeyCodec or ValueCodec decode implementations called at lines 118-119, achieving code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Multi-component: Iterator + Schema] [Cross-schema contamination] Can iterating over one schema accidentally return keys/values from another schema due to column family name collisions or encoding issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [Function: next_impl()] [Transaction isolation break] During parallel transaction execution, can multiple iterators reading the same state see inconsistent views, causing Block-STM's optimistic execution to fail? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [System-wide: Storage] [Cascade failure] If iterator errors cause validator crashes, can an attacker deliberately corrupt specific database entries to selectively crash validators and affect consensus quorum? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/schemadb/src/iterator.rs] [System-wide: State proof] [Proof generation vulnerability] Can inconsistent iteration during state proof generation cause proofs to be invalid or verifiable against wrong state roots, breaking light client security? (Critical)"
