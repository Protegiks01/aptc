  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Attack Scenario: Logic Bomb] Can an attacker create a complex boolean filter with deeply nested And/Or/Not operations that passes size validation but causes exponential evaluation time, leading to indexer DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Data Integrity: Event Data] The data_substring_filter searches raw event data bytes. Can binary event data with embedded null bytes or invalid UTF-8 cause the filter to behave incorrectly or crash? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Data Integrity: Module Names] Are Move module and struct names properly validated for allowed characters? Can special characters, control codes, or Unicode in module names bypass filters or cause parsing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Data Integrity: Sender Address] The sender address is standardized before comparison. If the transaction contains a non-standardized sender address, does this cause validation to fail or pass incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Data Integrity: Transaction Info] If item.info is present but success field is missing/corrupted, how does matches_opt() handle this? Can corrupted transaction info cause filter bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Performance: Finder Initialization] The Finder is initialized with into_owned() which may allocate. For filters with very long substring patterns, can this cause excessive memory usage per filter instance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Performance: Address Cloning] Multiple get_standardized_sender() and get_standardized_address() calls clone strings before standardizing. Can an attacker exploit this by causing filters to be evaluated frequently with long addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Performance: Filter Evaluation] Complex nested boolean filters require recursive evaluation. Can an attacker craft filters that cause O(2^n) evaluation time for n nested operations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/traits.rs] [Performance: Serialization Overhead] Every is_valid() call serializes the entire filter to JSON for error traces. For frequent validation in hot paths, can this cause severe performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Edge Case: Empty Address] What happens if standardize_address() receives an empty string or just",

  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Edge Case: Missing Module] In EntryFunctionFilter.matches(), if module_id.module is None but function matches, what's the expected behavior? Can this create inconsistent filtering? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Edge Case: Single Element Vectors] Do LogicalAnd([single_filter]) and LogicalOr([single_filter]) behave identically to single_filter, or can wrapping introduce unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Edge Case: Unknown Transaction Type] What happens when TransactionType::try_from() encounters a future/unknown transaction type value? Does it panic, return error, or have undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Deserialization: deny_unknown_fields] EventFilter uses #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]. Can an attacker bypass validation by removing this attribute in forked code or providing fields in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Deserialization: untagged Enum] BooleanTransactionFilter uses #[serde(untagged)] which tries all variants. Can ambiguous JSON cause incorrect variant selection or performance issues from trying all variants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Serialization: skip Field] The standardized_sender field is marked #[serde(skip)]. After deserialization, is OnceCell properly reinitialized, or can this cause the filter to use stale cached values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Protobuf: Size Check Bypass] The max_filter_size check uses encoded_len(). Can protobuf compression or encoding tricks allow an attacker to create filters that appear small but expand to huge structures? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/event.rs] [Concurrency: OnceCell Race] When multiple threads call matches() concurrently before Finder initialization, can OnceCell's get_or_init() cause multiple initializations or data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/move_module.rs] [Concurrency: Memoization Safety] If two threads call get_standardized_address() simultaneously on a fresh filter, can the OnceCell initialization race cause both threads to standardize the address twice? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Concurrency: Recursive Evaluation] When multiple threads evaluate the same nested boolean filter tree concurrently, can this cause contention on shared state or race conditions in filter evaluation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/user_transaction.rs] [Type Safety: Payload Extraction] The get_entry_function_payload_from_transaction_payload() returns Option<&EntryFunctionPayload>. Can the lifetime of this reference cause use-after-free if the Transaction is modified during filtering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/filters/transaction_root.rs] [Invariant: Success Flag] The success field is Option<bool>. Are there transaction types where success should always be true/false, and can incorrect values violate blockchain invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/boolean_transaction_filter.rs] [Invariant: Filter Oneof] The protobuf filter uses oneof for filter variants. If oneof is not set (None), does this cause panics or undefined behavior in new_from_proto()? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/transaction-filter/src/utils.rs] [Input Validation: Address Format] standardize_address() doesn't validate hex digit correctness for all characters, only the last one. Can invalid hex characters in middle positions cause incorrect standardization? (High)"
