  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: upgrade_payload_with_rng()] [Protocol version confusion] If different validators have different interpretations of payload versions, can an attacker create transactions that fork the chain by being valid on some nodes but invalid on others? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: has_nonce()] [Nonce check reliability] The has_nonce() method depends on payload's replay_protection_nonce() - can an attacker craft payloads where this check gives false results, bypassing replay protection or sequence validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [Function: get_transaction_expiration_time()] [Incomplete implementation] The unimplemented!() for Absolute expiration mode indicates incomplete code - are there production code paths that could trigger this panic, causing unexpected crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/transaction_builder.rs] [TODO comment] [Gas validation gap] The 'TODO(Gas): double check this' comments appear twice in the codebase - what critical gas validation is missing that could enable economic attacks or resource exhaustion? (High)"
