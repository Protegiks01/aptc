  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Type Safety] Can a malicious native function implementation violate the type signature contract by accepting incorrect Type arguments or returning values that don't match the declared return type, causing type confusion and potential memory corruption in the Move VM? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Memory Safety] Does the function signature guarantee that the VecDeque<Value> is properly consumed, or can implementations leave unconsumed values that could lead to memory leaks or state corruption across transaction boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Gas Metering Bypass] Can implementations of RawSafeNative skip calling SafeNativeContext::charge() before expensive operations, allowing attackers to execute unbounded computation and cause DoS by exhausting validator resources without paying gas? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Determinism Violation] Can non-deterministic implementations (using system time, random numbers, or external state) cause different validators to produce different execution results, breaking consensus and leading to chain splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Type: RawSafeNative] [Return Value Manipulation] Can a malicious implementation return SmallVec with incorrect number of values or wrong value types that the VM expects, causing stack corruption or undefined behavior in subsequent Move bytecode execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: SafeNativeContext] [Mutable Context Abuse] Can implementations improperly mutate the SafeNativeContext (e.g., corrupting gas state, feature flags, or extensions) in ways that affect subsequent native calls or VM execution, causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: SafeNativeContext] [Gas Meter Manipulation] Can implementations directly access and manipulate the gas meter through SafeNativeContext to artificially inflate or deflate gas consumption, breaking gas economics and enabling DoS or underpaying attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: SafeNativeContext] [Feature Flag Bypass] Can implementations ignore feature flag checks in SafeNativeContext::get_feature_flags(), enabling disabled features and causing protocol violations or incompatibility across validators running different versions? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: SafeNativeContext] [Memory Limit Bypass] Can implementations avoid calling SafeNativeContext::use_heap_memory() for allocations, bypassing memory tracking and allowing unbounded memory consumption leading to validator node crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: &[Type]] [Type Argument Validation] Can implementations fail to validate the number and kind of type arguments, accepting malformed type signatures that cause type system violations when values are constructed or returned? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: &[Type]] [Generic Type Confusion] Can attackers pass type arguments with deeply nested generics or recursive types that cause exponential blowup in type checking, leading to DoS or stack overflow in native function execution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: &[Type]] [Resource Type Misuse] Can implementations incorrectly handle resource types in the type arguments, allowing duplication or destruction of resources that violates Move's linear type system and enables double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: &[Type]] [Type Parameter Bounds] Can implementations accept type arguments that violate expected constraints (e.g., non-copyable types where copies are expected), causing undefined behavior when values are manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: VecDeque<Value>] [Argument Count Mismatch] Can implementations fail to validate argument count, leading to panic on unwrap or incorrect behavior when accessing non-existent arguments from the VecDeque? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: VecDeque<Value>] [Value Type Casting] Can implementations use unsafe value_as::<T>() casts without proper error handling, causing panics or memory corruption when the actual value type doesn't match expected type T? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-native-interface/src/native.rs] [Parameter: VecDeque<Value>] [Resource Ownership] Can implementations duplicate or drop resource values incorrectly, violating Move's linear type system and potentially causing double-spending or permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
