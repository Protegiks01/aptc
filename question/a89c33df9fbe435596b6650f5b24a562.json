  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg] [Deserialization attack] Can a malicious validator send a ConsensusMsg with malformed serialized data that causes deserialization panics or undefined behavior, potentially crashing honest validators and causing loss of liveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::DeprecatedBlockRetrievalRequest] [Type confusion] Can an attacker exploit the deprecated BlockRetrievalRequest variant to bypass newer security checks by forcing validators to process old message formats that may lack critical validation, potentially enabling consensus manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::BlockRetrievalRequest] [Version confusion] Is there proper validation to prevent an attacker from mixing deprecated and new BlockRetrievalRequest variants in the same epoch, potentially causing state inconsistencies across validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::ProposalMsg] [Byzantine proposal] Can a malicious validator craft a ProposalMsg with valid signatures but manipulated block content that passes initial validation, allowing them to propose invalid blocks and break consensus safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::VoteMsg] [Vote manipulation] Can an attacker send multiple conflicting VoteMsg messages for different blocks at the same round by exploiting lack of equivocation checks in message routing, enabling double-voting attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::CommitVoteMsg] [Execution result manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator send fabricated CommitVoteMsg with incorrect state roots that could be accepted by honest validators if signature verification is not properly enforced at the message layer? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::CommitDecisionMsg] [Premature commit] Can an attacker send CommitDecisionMsg before collecting the required 2f+1 signatures, potentially causing honest validators to commit to incorrect execution results? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::BatchMsg] [Quorum Store DoS] Can a malicious node flood the network with oversized BatchMsg messages containing extremely large transaction batches, exhausting memory and network resources of honest validators? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::BatchRequestMsg] [Request flooding] Can an attacker send unlimited BatchRequestMsg requests for non-existent batches, forcing honest validators to perform expensive lookups and degrading consensus performance? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::SignedBatchInfo] [Signature forgery] Is the SignedBatchInfoMsg variant properly validated for signature authenticity before processing, or can an attacker forge batch signatures to cause validators to persist invalid batches? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::ProofOfStoreMsg] [Proof manipulation] Can a Byzantine validator create fake ProofOfStoreMsg with invalid quorum certificates that appear valid, causing honest validators to reference non-existent batches in proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::DAGMessage] [DAG protocol bypass] Can an attacker exploit DAGMessage routing to inject malicious DAG vertices that bypass consensus ordering rules, potentially causing non-deterministic block execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::CommitMessage] [Reliable broadcast attack] Can a malicious node exploit CommitMessage propagation to cause inconsistent commit states across validators by selectively delivering messages to different subsets of nodes? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::RandGenMessage] [Randomness manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate RandGenMessage contents to bias the randomness generation process, potentially influencing leader election or other protocol randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::OrderVoteMsg] [Ordering attack] Can a Byzantine validator send OrderVoteMsg for blocks before receiving valid quorum certificates, attempting to prematurely advance consensus state? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::RoundTimeoutMsg] [Timeout manipulation] Can an attacker broadcast fake RoundTimeoutMsg to force unnecessary round changes, degrading consensus liveness and enabling timeout-based DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::OptProposalMsg] [Optimistic proposal bypass] Can a malicious validator exploit OptProposalMsg to propose blocks that bypass normal proposal validation, potentially breaking consensus safety guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/src/network_interface.rs] [Enum: ConsensusMsg::BatchMsgV2] [Version downgrade] Can an attacker force validators to accept older BatchMsg variants instead of BatchMsgV2 to exploit known vulnerabilities in legacy batch handling? (High)",
