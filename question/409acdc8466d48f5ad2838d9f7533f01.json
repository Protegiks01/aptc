  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Currency Validation] At lines 208 and 215, is the currency properly validated to be a legitimate token type, or can an attacker specify a fake currency to bypass balance checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Receiver Account Check] At line 188, is there validation that the receiver account exists, or can funds be sent to non-existent accounts causing permanent loss? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Self-Transfer] Can a user transfer funds to themselves at lines 203-218, and if so, could this create inconsistencies in sequence numbers or gas calculations leading to stuck transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: transfer()] [Zero Amount] Is there validation preventing zero or negative amount transfers that could be used to spam the network or manipulate account states? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Account Collision] At line 168, can an attacker front-run account creation by predicting the new_account address and creating it first, causing the original transaction to fail and waste gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Duplicate Creation] Is there validation preventing multiple create_account operations for the same address in quick succession, potentially creating race conditions or inconsistent states? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Privilege Escalation] At line 168, can an attacker create accounts with system-reserved addresses (0x0, 0x1, etc.) to gain unauthorized access to privileged operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: create_account()] [Gas Exhaustion] If account creation requires specific gas amounts, can an attacker specify insufficient max_gas causing the transaction to fail after consuming gas, resulting in fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_operator()] [Operator Hijacking] At lines 234-273, can an attacker who temporarily gains control of the private_key change the operator to a malicious address, permanently hijacking staking rewards and control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_operator()] [Old Operator Bypass] At line 238, when old_operator is None, the parse_not_same flag is set to true (line 270). Can this allow bypassing validation checks that would normally prevent unauthorized operator changes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_operator()] [Operator Validation] Is there validation that the new_operator address at line 239 is different from old_operator, or can redundant operations waste gas or create state inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_operator()] [Atomic Change] If the transaction fails after operator change, is there proper rollback, or can the system enter an inconsistent state with undefined operator? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_voter()] [Authorization Check] At line 279, is there validation that the sender has authority to set the voter, or can any account change the voter for a staking pool they don't control? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_voter()] [Voter Deadlock] Can setting new_voter to an invalid or non-existent address permanently lock voting power, preventing participation in governance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: set_voter()] [Operator Requirement] At lines 279 and 310, when operator is None, is there proper validation ensuring only authorized parties can set voters, or does this create a privilege bypass? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: reset_lockup()] [Premature Unlock] At lines 315-351, can an attacker exploit reset_lockup to unlock staked funds before the lockup period expires, violating staking economics and enabling early withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: reset_lockup()] [Repeated Reset] Is there rate limiting preventing repeated reset_lockup calls that could manipulate lockup timers or create DoS conditions on the staking system? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs] [Function: reset_lockup()] [Operator Authorization] At line 319, if operator is Some, is there validation that the operator has permission to reset lockup, or can unauthorized operators manipulate lockup periods? (High)",
