  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_value()] [Batch write atomicity] When multiple auxiliary data entries are written in a SchemaBatch, if encode_value() fails for one entry after others succeeded, can partial batch commits leave the database in an inconsistent state with missing auxiliary data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Version overflow attack] Can an attacker cause integer overflow by querying get_transaction_auxiliary_data() with version = u64::MAX, causing decode_key() to wrap around to version 0 and return auxiliary data from the genesis transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Version reordering] Can an attacker exploit timezone differences or clock skew to cause encode_key() to produce versions that appear in non-chronological order in RocksDB, breaking the ledger history invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Version gap exploitation] If prune() deletes versions [100-200] but version 150's auxiliary data is still cached, can decode_key() incorrectly validate that version 150 exists in the database, allowing queries to return stale cached data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Schema: TransactionAuxiliaryDataSchema] [Version collision via pruning] When pruning deletes old versions and new transactions reuse those version numbers, can the lack of version-to-epoch tracking in the schema cause auxiliary data from different epochs to collide? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: encode_key()] [Version spoofing] Can a Byzantine validator during consensus propose a block with transaction versions that encode to keys already existing in RocksDB, causing put_transaction_auxiliary_data() to silently overwrite existing auxiliary data? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Error propagation failure] When ensure_slice_len_eq() returns an error for invalid key length, is the error properly propagated through the Result type, or can silent error suppression cause decode_key() to return a default version value?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Zero version handling] Is version 0 (genesis) handled correctly by decode_key(), or can reading auxiliary data for the genesis transaction cause unexpected behavior due to uninitialized state?

(High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_value()] [Malformed enum handling] If stored BCS data represents TransactionAuxiliaryData::V1 with a missing or null VMErrorDetail field, can bcs::from_bytes() deserialize it into an invalid state that causes panics when accessed?

  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/schema/transaction_auxiliary_data/mod.rs] [Function: decode_key()] [Consensus mismatch] During state synchronization, if one validator's decode_key() interprets a key differently than another's due to platform differences, can this cause replicated state to diverge?
