  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Type Arguments] Does TransactionFeeBurnCap's StructTag properly handle type_args (currently empty), and can malicious type arguments be injected during construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Identifier Creation] Can the Identifier::new() calls in struct_tag_for_config fail or panic for TransactionFeeBurnCap's identifiers, causing DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [AccessPath Manipulation] When access_path_for_config is called for TransactionFeeBurnCap, can the generated AccessPath be manipulated to point to a different resource? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Resource Path Collision] Can the resource_path_vec for TransactionFeeBurnCap collide with paths for other resources, enabling unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Storage Backend Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the ConfigStorage trait implementation to fetch TransactionFeeBurnCap from an unauthorized or compromised storage backend? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [StateView Corruption] If the StateView is corrupted or poisoned, can TransactionFeeBurnCap fetch return malicious burn capabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Bytes Cloning] The fetch_config_bytes clones bytes - can this lead to memory exhaustion if TransactionFeeBurnCap data is extremely large? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Epoch Mismatch] In OnChainConfigPayload, can epoch mismatches cause TransactionFeeBurnCap from the wrong epoch to be used? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Trait: OnChainConfig] [Provider Arc Race] The OnChainConfigPayload uses Arc<Provider> - can reference counting races lead to use-after-free when accessing TransactionFeeBurnCap? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: CONFIG_ID] [Registry Collision] Can the CONFIG_ID for TransactionFeeBurnCap collide with other on-chain configs in the registry, causing incorrect config to be fetched? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Constant: CONFIG_ID] [Display Spoofing] Can the fmt::Display implementation for CONFIG_ID be exploited to spoof log messages about TransactionFeeBurnCap? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Module: transaction_fee] [Link-Time Substitution] Can link-time optimization or dynamic library injection replace the TransactionFeeBurnCap implementation with a malicious version? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Module: transaction_fee] [Symbol Visibility] Are the TransactionFeeBurnCap symbols properly scoped to prevent external code from accessing or modifying them? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Fuzzing Coverage] Has TransactionFeeBurnCap been fuzzed with malformed BCS data to ensure robust deserialization error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Property Testing] Are there property-based tests ensuring TransactionFeeBurnCap serialization round-trips correctly under all conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Schema Evolution] If TransactionFeeBurnCap needs to add fields in future, can the migration be done safely without breaking existing on-chain data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Backward Compatibility] Is there a versioning mechanism to ensure old validators can deserialize new TransactionFeeBurnCap formats during rolling upgrades? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/on_chain_config/transaction_fee.rs] [Struct: TransactionFeeBurnCap] [Governance Override] Can governance proposals modify the TransactionFeeBurnCap structure or location without proper validation, breaking the system? (Critical)"
