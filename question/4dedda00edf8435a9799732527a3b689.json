  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Access Control] Can an attacker create a multisig account with num_signatures_required set to 0, bypassing all signature requirements and allowing unauthorized transaction execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Integer Overflow] Can num_signatures_required be set to u64::MAX causing integer overflow in signature verification logic, potentially bypassing threshold checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Logic Error] Can num_signatures_required exceed the total number of owners (sender + additional_owners.len()), creating an unexecutable multisig that permanently locks funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Struct: Create] [Input Validation] Can additional_owners contain duplicate addresses including the sender's address, inflating the apparent owner count while reducing actual security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [State Manipulation] Can an attacker include the multisig account's own address (before it's created) in additional_owners, creating circular ownership dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker create unlimited multisig accounts with massive additional_owners vectors (Vec<AccountAddress>), causing storage DoS or exceeding gas limits unpredictably? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateSummary::from()] [State Extraction] In the WriteSetChange parsing logic at lines 64-77, can an attacker manipulate transaction changes to extract the wrong multisig_address, causing CLI to report incorrect account creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateSummary::from()] [Type Confusion] Can WriteResource with data.typ.name == 'Account' but different module path bypass the address filtering logic, causing multisig_account to be set incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateSummary::from()] [Address Spoofing] Can hex address comparison at line 67 be exploited with case sensitivity or padding differences to incorrectly identify the multisig account? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: Create::execute()] [Metadata Bypass] The TODO comment at line 95-96 indicates empty metadata vectors - can this be exploited to create multisig accounts without proper identification, enabling phishing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Hash Collision] When store_hash_only=true at lines 131-135, can an attacker find a SHA3-256 collision to propose a malicious payload that hashes to the same value as a legitimate transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Payload Manipulation] Can BCS serialization of MultisigTransactionPayload at line 129-130 be manipulated with malformed bytes to bypass validation while executing different logic on-chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Double Proposal] Is there protection against proposing the same transaction multiple times to the same multisig account, potentially wasting gas or causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Owner Verification] Does the function verify that the transaction sender is actually an owner of the multisig account before creating the proposal, or can non-owners create proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent CreateTransaction calls with the same parameters create duplicate proposals with different sequence numbers, causing state inconsistency? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/account/multisig_account.rs] [Function: CreateTransaction::execute()] [Payload Type Safety] Can entry_function_args.try_into() conversion at line 130 fail silently or produce unexpected MultisigTransactionPayload types that execute malicious code? (High)",
