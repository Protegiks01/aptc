  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Shared reference safety] If FunctionInfo is shared across threads using Arc<FunctionInfo>, can interior mutability via unsafe code violate thread safety guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Cache poisoning] If FunctionInfo instances are cached for performance, can attackers poison the cache with malicious instances that persist across transactions, affecting subsequent executions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [VM bytecode injection] Can malicious FunctionInfo be converted to MoveValue in a way that injects invalid bytecode or type descriptors into the Move VM, causing crashes or arbitrary code execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Type mismatch] Can as_move_value() produce a MoveValue that doesn't match the expected aptos_framework::function_info::FunctionInfo type signature, causing type safety violations in Move? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Resource semantics] Does FunctionInfo conversion respect Move's resource semantics (no copy/drop)? Can violations lead to resource duplication or unauthorized destruction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Global storage] If FunctionInfo is stored in Move global storage via as_move_value(), can attackers modify stored instances to redirect future function calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Identifier constraints] Are module_name and function_name validated against Move identifier rules (alphanumeric + underscore, no leading numbers)? Can invalid identifiers bypass validation and cause VM errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Reserved keywords] Can module_name or function_name be Move reserved keywords (move, script, public, etc.), causing parsing ambiguities or VM errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Length limits] Are there enforced maximum length limits for module_name and function_name? Can unbounded lengths cause stack overflows or memory exhaustion in the VM? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Special characters] Can module_name or function_name contain special characters that have special meaning in Move syntax (., :, <, >, etc.), causing parsing errors or security bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Zero address] Can module_address be set to 0x0, potentially bypassing access controls or causing null pointer dereferences in module resolution? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [System address spoofing] Can attackers set module_address to system addresses (0x1 for aptos_framework, 0x3 for token, 0x4 for governance) to impersonate system modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Address format] Does module_address use canonical format? Can non-canonical addresses (short vs. long form) cause function resolution to different modules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Struct: FunctionInfo] [Account existence] Is there validation that module_address points to an account with deployed code? Can references to non-existent addresses cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Error propagation] Does from_str() properly propagate all error conditions from MemberId::from_str()? Can error suppression hide security-critical parsing failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: from_str()] [Panic safety] Can malformed input strings cause panics in from_str() instead of returning proper errors, leading to validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: fmt()] [Display panic] Can invalid UTF-8 in module_name or function_name cause panics during Display formatting, crashing validators during logging or error reporting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Function: as_move_value()] [Conversion failure] Can as_move_value() fail silently for certain FunctionInfo instances, producing corrupted MoveValues that cause VM errors later? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Integration: Account Abstraction] [Custom validation bypass] In account abstraction, can attackers craft FunctionInfo pointing to malicious validation functions that always return true, bypassing all authentication? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Integration: Account Abstraction] [Validation function substitution] Can FunctionInfo be modified between account creation and transaction execution, redirecting validation to attacker-controlled functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/types/src/function_info.rs] [Integration: Account Abstraction] [Cross-account validation] Can FunctionInfo reference validation functions from different accounts, allowing one account's validation logic to authorize transactions for another account? (Critical)",
