  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Struct: AbstractedAccount] [Function pointer safety] Is the sign_func properly validated before use, or can it be a malicious function that leaks transaction data or signs incorrect messages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Struct: DomainAbstractedAccount] [Identity verification] Does the account_identity get cryptographically verified during signing, or can it be manipulated post-construction? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Function: private_key()] [Keyless panic] The private_key() method uses todo!() for Keyless accounts - can this be triggered by API misuse to cause denial of service? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Function: AccountKey::from_private_key()] [Key validation] Does from_private_key() validate that the provided Ed25519PrivateKey is a valid curve point, or can invalid keys be accepted? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Function: from_derive_path()] [Password bypass] The function uses empty password ('') for seed generation - can this be exploited to brute-force keys if the mnemonic is known? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Function: HardwareWalletAccount::sign_transaction()] [Message tampering] Does signing_message() produce a deterministic and collision-resistant message, or can attackers craft transactions with identical signing messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/sdk/src/types.rs] [Function: HardwareWalletAccount::sign_transaction()] [Signature verification] After getting signature from hardware wallet, is it verified against the public key before returning, or can corrupted signatures be accepted? (High)",
