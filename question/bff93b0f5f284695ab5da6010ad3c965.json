  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Usage: move-vm/verified_module_cache.rs:17] [Deterministic execution violation] If different validators have different VerifiedModuleCache configurations (different NonZeroUsize values), can this lead to different module verification patterns that cause subtle gas metering differences, breaking deterministic execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Usage: move-vm/verified_module_cache.rs:17] [Const unwrap safety] The use of .unwrap() on a const NonZeroUsize value assumes compile-time safety - but can linker optimization or const evaluation bugs cause this to fail at runtime in production builds? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Race condition] Can concurrent initialization of multiple components using NonZeroUsize! lead to race conditions where shared configuration values are read mid-update, resulting in zero values that trigger panics across multiple validator threads simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Panic propagation in async] When NonZeroUsize! panics occur in async contexts (tokio runtime), can the panic propagate incorrectly, leaving the async executor in an inconsistent state that prevents other consensus tasks from making progress? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Lock poisoning] If NonZeroUsize! panics while holding mutexes (e.g., during cache initialization within locked sections), can this poison locks that prevent other validator threads from accessing critical consensus or storage state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Thread-local storage] Can NonZeroUsize! be used with thread-local values that vary across validator threads, leading to inconsistent cache capacities or configurations that cause non-deterministic behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Config file attack] Can attackers manipulate validator configuration files to inject zero values that get passed to NonZeroUsize!, causing validator startup failure and network-wide liveness issues if multiple validators use the same malicious config? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Default value vulnerability] If configuration loading fails and falls back to default values, can a zero default inadvertently get passed to NonZeroUsize!, causing unexpected panics during validator initialization? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Hot reload attack] During runtime configuration updates (hot reload), can temporary zero values during the config transition period trigger NonZeroUsize! panics that crash running validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Governance parameter change] Can on-chain governance proposals that modify cache sizes or queue capacities introduce zero values that get validated only at the next epoch boundary, causing mass validator panics during epoch transition? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Subtraction underflow] Can expressions like NonZeroUsize!(some_value - 1) underflow when some_value is 1, wrapping to usize::MAX and creating an excessively large cache that exhausts memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Division by zero predecessor] Can calculations like capacity/divisor where divisor is computed dynamically result in zero, and then passing this to NonZeroUsize! causes panics that weren't expected during the mathematical operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Multiplication overflow] Can expressions involving multiplication (e.g., NonZeroUsize!(base_size * multiplier)) overflow and wrap to zero, bypassing the intended capacity limits and causing cache initialization with zero capacity? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Bitwise operation edge case] Can bitwise operations in the expression (e.g., NonZeroUsize!(value & mask)) result in zero when all bits are masked out, triggering unexpected panics in components that assume non-zero capacity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Test: test_nonzero] [Boundary testing gap] The test only validates values 1 and usize::MAX (lines 21-22) - are there edge cases between these extremes where overflow, underflow, or type conversion bugs could produce zero values that aren't caught by the test suite? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Test: test_zero] [Panic recovery] The test_zero function expects panic (line 28), but does this adequately test panic recovery in production contexts where the panic might occur in critical paths that require cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Test: test_zero_custom_message] [Message validation] The test doesn't validate that custom panic messages are properly sanitized - can arbitrary strings in custom messages be exploited when logged or displayed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Test coverage] [Production scenarios] The tests don't cover real usage scenarios from consensus, storage, or channels - can production configurations or state transitions trigger zero values that aren't tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Cross-component] [Cache consistency] When multiple components (RoundManager, StateMerkleDB, HotStateLRU) use NonZeroUsize for cache capacities, can inconsistent capacity ratios cause performance cliffs where one cache becomes a bottleneck, degrading overall validator performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Cross-component] [Memory budget violation] Can the sum of all NonZeroUsize-configured cache sizes across consensus, storage, and execution exceed available system memory, causing OOM kills that halt validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Cross-component] [Initialization order] Can the order in which components initialize their NonZeroUsize-based caches create race conditions where later components fail to initialize due to memory exhaustion from earlier caches? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Cross-component] [Upgrade compatibility] During validator software upgrades, can changes to NonZeroUsize capacity values in new versions cause validators to panic during the upgrade transition, requiring network coordination to prevent mass outages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Economic attack] [Griefing via cache eviction] Can attackers craft transactions or blocks designed to maximize cache misses in NonZeroUsize-configured LRU caches, increasing validator costs and creating economic pressure to reduce security margins? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Economic attack] [Validator DoS incentive] If causing validators to panic via zero-value configuration has low cost but high impact (network disruption), can rational attackers be incentivized to target this weakness for profit through shorts or competing chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-infallible/src/nonzero.rs] [Macro: NonZeroUsize!] [Unsafe coercion] Can unsafe code elsewhere in the codebase create NonZeroUsize values that are actually zero through invalid pointer casts or mem::transmute, bypassing the macro's safety check? (High)"
