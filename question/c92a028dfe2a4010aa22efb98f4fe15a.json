  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Information Disclosure] Can malicious peers inject sensitive data into the 'message' field that gets logged, exposing private validator state, cryptographic material, or internal network topology to attackers monitoring logs? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.error] [Information Disclosure] Does the 'error' field expose detailed internal error messages that reveal implementation details, memory addresses, or state machine internals that could aid attackers in crafting exploits against the storage service? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.request] [Information Disclosure] Can logging the full 'request' field expose transaction data, account addresses, or state query patterns that enable privacy attacks or targeted DoS against specific validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.response] [Information Disclosure] Does logging 'response' data leak state proof information, Merkle tree structures, or transaction outputs that could be used to analyze validator behavior patterns or predict future state? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.peer_network_id] [Privacy Violation] Can logging 'peer_network_id' enable network topology mapping attacks where adversaries correlate log entries across validators to identify peer relationships and target specific validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Injection] Can malicious peers craft StorageServiceRequest objects with embedded control characters, newlines, or escape sequences that corrupt structured logs and enable log injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Serialization] Does the serde 'rename_all = snake_case' attribute properly sanitize enum variant names during serialization, or can malicious enum values bypass validation and inject arbitrary JSON/log content? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.message] [Log Injection] Are string messages in the 'message' field properly escaped before logging, or can attackers inject malicious log entries that manipulate log aggregation systems or monitoring dashboards? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.request] [Serialization Attack] Can a malicious peer send a crafted StorageServiceRequest that triggers excessive serialization overhead when logged, causing CPU/memory exhaustion and degrading storage service performance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [DoS via Logging] Can an attacker flood the storage service with requests that trigger excessive logging, filling disk space and causing log rotation failures that prevent legitimate audit trail maintenance? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: ReceivedStorageRequest] [Resource Exhaustion] Can malicious peers send high-frequency storage requests that generate excessive 'ReceivedStorageRequest' log entries, overwhelming log processing pipelines and causing validator performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: StorageServiceError] [Log Flooding] Can attackers trigger error conditions that generate repeated 'StorageServiceError' log entries, filling logs with noise that obscures legitimate security incidents and audit events? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Memory Exhaustion] If LogSchema instances are retained in memory buffers before flushing, can an attacker craft large request/response objects that cause unbounded memory growth in the logging subsystem? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Timing Attack] Do log entries with different fields (error vs. success) have observable timing differences that enable side-channel attacks to infer storage service internal state or request processing patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: OptimisticFetchRequest] [Timing Leak] Can timing analysis of 'OptimisticFetchRequest' log entries reveal information about state synchronization progress, enabling attackers to predict when validators are vulnerable during epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry: SubscriptionRequest] [State Leakage] Do subscription-related log entries leak information about which peers are subscribing to state updates, enabling targeted attacks against validators with active synchronization sessions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Audit Trail Tampering] Since LogSchema doesn't include cryptographic signatures or tamper-evidence mechanisms, can attackers modify log files post-generation to hide malicious activity during forensic analysis? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Integrity] Is there any mechanism to detect if log entries are deleted, reordered, or modified by an attacker with filesystem access, potentially hiding consensus violations or Byzantine behavior? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [LogEntry variants] [Audit Completeness] Are critical security events (like validator authentication failures, rate limiting triggers, or suspicious request patterns) properly logged, or can attackers exploit gaps in audit coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Function: new()] [Race Condition] Is the LogSchema::new() constructor thread-safe when called concurrently from multiple request handlers, or can race conditions cause field corruption or mixed log entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Concurrent Mutation] If LogSchema instances are shared across threads (unlikely but possible), can concurrent field updates cause data races that corrupt log entries or expose partial state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.error] [Error Amplification] Can recursive or cascading errors in the storage service trigger exponential log entry generation where each error logs the previous error, causing log overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/state-sync/storage-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema.request] [Malformed Input] What happens if StorageServiceRequest contains malformed data that cannot be serialized - does it panic, return an error, or log a corrupted entry that breaks log parsing? (Medium)",
