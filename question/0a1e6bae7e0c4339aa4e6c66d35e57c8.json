  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Protocol: SCRAPE] [Completeness violation] Can there exist valid degree t-1 polynomial evaluations that incorrectly fail the low_degree_test due to numerical precision issues or field arithmetic edge cases? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Protocol: SCRAPE] [Zero-knowledge leakage] Does the dual code word f leak information about the polynomial being tested, potentially revealing secrets in DKG or threshold signature protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Protocol: SCRAPE] [Batch verification bypass] If multiple low-degree tests are performed with the same LowDegreeTest instance, can an attacker exploit state reuse to pass tests for invalid polynomials? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Parameter: includes_zero] [Logic confusion] When includes_zero is true, the code expects n-1 evaluations at roots of unity and 1 evaluation at zero. Can confusion about evaluation ordering (is zero at index 0 or n-1?) cause incorrect validation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Parameter: includes_zero] [Domain size mismatch] Lines 38-45 check batch_dom.size() against min_size. When includes_zero is true, can batch_dom have size exactly n-1, causing FFT operations to access out-of-bounds memory? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Parameter: includes_zero] [Dual code word computation] In dual_code_word() lines 173-177, when includes_zero is true, fft_size becomes n-1. Can this cause the Lagrange denominator computation to use the wrong set of evaluation points? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Parameter: includes_zero] [Extra element position] Line 194 pushes f_0 to the extra vector, which is chained after f_evals at line 201. Does this mean the evaluation at zero is assumed to be at position n-1 in the evals array, and what happens if it's at position 0? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [FFT implementation bug] Line 181 calls batch_dom.fft(). Can the underlying arkworks FFT implementation have bugs that produce incorrect results for certain input polynomials, breaking SCRAPE soundness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Radix-2 requirement] The batch_dom is typed as Radix2EvaluationDomain. Can an attacker provide a domain size that is not a power of 2, and does the type system catch this, or can runtime errors occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Domain generator] The batch_dom has a specific generator omega. Can an attacker manipulate the generator to be a root of unity of the wrong order, causing FFT to produce incorrect evaluations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [FFT inverse] The code uses fft() for forward transform. Is there any case where ifft() (inverse FFT) should be used instead, and can confusion between them cause validation errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Denominator zero] If all_lagrange_denominators at line 185-189 returns denominators containing zero elements, can division by zero occur in subsequent operations, or can zero denominators make the dual code word degenerate? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Denominator length] The function all_lagrange_denominators returns vector v. Can its length differ from expected fft_size + (includes_zero ? 1 : 0), causing the assertion at line 198 to fail in debug builds or silent corruption in release builds? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Denominator computation correctness] The all_lagrange_denominators function computes 1 / prod_{j != i}(omega^i - omega^j). Can numerical instability or field arithmetic edge cases cause these denominators to be incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: random()] [Panic in production] Line 87 uses unwrap() which can panic. In a production validator environment during DKG, can this cause consensus failure if multiple validators panic simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test_group()] [MSM unwrap] Line 150 unwraps the MSM result. What error conditions can C::msm() return, and can they be triggered by malicious inputs to cause validator crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Index out of bounds] Line 178 accesses self.f[0] without bounds checking. Although the constructor validates f is non-empty when t != n (line 59-61), can race conditions or memory corruption cause f to be empty here? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Error message injection] Lines 40-44, 48-49, 52-56, 60 use bail!() with formatted error messages. Can an attacker provide parameters that cause excessive string formatting, leading to memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Struct: LowDegreeTest] [Shared mutable state] If batch_dom references shared mutable state (e.g., cached FFT twiddle factors), can concurrent calls to low_degree_test() or dual_code_word() cause data races? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Mutable iterator] Lines 122-126 use iterators that should be immutable, but can unsafe code elsewhere mutate evals or v_times_f during iteration, causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [FFT thread safety] Line 181 calls fft() on batch_dom. Is the FFT implementation thread-safe, or can concurrent FFT calls interfere with each other's internal state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: new()] [Vector ownership] The constructor at line 32 takes ownership of the vector f. Can double-free or use-after-free occur if the same vector is passed to multiple LowDegreeTest instances? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: dual_code_word()] [Temporary vector] Lines 192 creates a temporary extra vector. Can this cause unnecessary heap allocations in hot paths, leading to performance degradation or memory fragmentation? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Function: low_degree_test()] [Large vector allocation] If n is very large, the dual_code_word() returns a Vec<F> of size n. Can this cause memory exhaustion if called repeatedly in a loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/scrape.rs] [Generic: F] [Field type confusion] The code is generic over F: PrimeField. Can an attacker instantiate LowDegreeTest with a non-standard field implementation that violates arithmetic properties, breaking SCRAPE soundness? (High)"
