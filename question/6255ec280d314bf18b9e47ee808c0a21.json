  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Function: test_scalar_multiplication_consistency()] [Multiplication algorithm] If old library uses double-and-add while new uses windowed method, could validators be DoS'd by sending signatures requiring many scalar multiplications, exhausting CPU during consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Function: test_bigint_layout_compatibility(), line 22] [Test value coverage] The hardcoded test values {0, 1, u64::MAX, 1234567890123456789} may not cover all critical boundaries - are values near Fr field modulus (2^255 - 19) tested to catch reduction edge cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Function: test_addition_consistency(), line 102] [Generator doubling] Could repeated doubling of the generator (2G, 4G, 8G, ...) hit special points on the curve that behave differently between libraries, causing aggregate signature verification failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Function: test_fr_operations_consistency(), line 149] [50 iterations] Is 50 random test iterations sufficient to catch rare field arithmetic bugs, or could specific Fr element combinations (e.g., multiplicative generator edge cases) be missed? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Function: test_pairing_consistency(), line 174] [10 random pairings] Testing only 10 random pairings may miss rare edge cases - are pairings involving low-order points or special curve points (e.g., points with small x-coordinates) validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Import declarations] [Dependency pinning] Are the arkworks library versions precisely pinned in Cargo.toml, or could minor version updates introduce subtle cryptographic behavior changes breaking production validators? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Import declarations] [Feature flag differences] Do both arkworks versions enable identical feature flags (e.g., parallel, asm optimizations), or could feature mismatches cause computational differences? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Overall test suite] [Specification gap] Are the cryptographic properties being tested formally specified (commutativity, associativity, bilinearity), or could the tests pass while missing critical algebraic invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Overall test suite] [Soundness vs completeness] Do the tests provide soundness guarantees (if tests pass, libraries are compatible) or just weak completeness (finding some bugs), and could untested code paths harbor critical vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Overall test suite] [Test environment vs production] Are tests running in the same environment as production validators (same CPU architecture, compiler flags, optimization levels), or could environmental differences cause cryptographic divergence in production? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Overall test suite] [Compiler optimizations] Could aggressive compiler optimizations (like LLVM's loop unrolling or constant folding) cause different code generation between debug tests and release builds, introducing production-only bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/unit_tests/arkworks_upgrade.rs] [Overall test suite] [Hardware acceleration] If one library uses assembly-optimized field arithmetic while the other uses portable Rust, could hardware-specific instructions (AVX2, BMI2) cause results to differ on different validator CPUs? (High)"
