  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_all_proposals()] [State Isolation] Does simulate_all_proposals() properly isolate state between proposal simulations, or can one proposal affect another's execution environment? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: simulate_all_proposals()] [Empty Proposal Set] When no proposals are found, the function bails - but could this hide critical configuration errors that should be detected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Constant: DUMMY_PROPOSAL_ID] [ID Collision] Can DUMMY_PROPOSAL_ID (u64::MAX) collide with real proposal IDs in edge cases where proposal counters overflow? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Multiple Functions] [u16 Casting] Multiple functions cast usize to u16 for index types - can pool sizes exceeding 65535 cause silent truncation and index corruption? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Index Types] Do all index types (AddressIdentifierIndex, IdentifierIndex, etc.) properly validate that casted values fit in u16 range? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Unwrap Usage] Functions use .unwrap() on file_name(), file_stem() - can malformed paths cause panics that crash the simulation? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Bytecode Semantics] Can the injected bytecode sequence violate Move semantics in subtle ways that pass verification but cause runtime issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/simulate.rs] [Function: patch_aptos_governance()] [Stack Balance] Does the verifier ensure stack balance for the injected bytecode, or can stack mismatches cause VM corruption? (High)",
