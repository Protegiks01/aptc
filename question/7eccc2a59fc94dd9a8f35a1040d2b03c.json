  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_add_box()] [Pop_back panic] Can the args.pop_back().unwrap() operations panic if the VecDeque is unexpectedly empty, crashing validators? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_destroy_empty_box()] [Insert assertion] The assert!(table_data.removed_tables.insert(handle)) - can this fail if the handle already exists in removed_tables, causing validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: TableData::get_or_create_table()] [Layout expect panic] The expect() calls for delayed fields - can delayed fields ever exist contrary to expectations, causing validator panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: into_change_set()] [Non-deterministic iteration] Does BTreeMap iteration order guarantee deterministic results across all validators, or can iteration order differences cause change set divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: serialize()] [Serialization non-determinism] Can serialization produce different byte sequences for the same value on different validators due to floating point, system dependencies, or implementation differences? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: Table::get_or_create_global_value()] [Resolver non-determinism] If the TableResolver returns different data to different validators, can this cause permanent state divergence requiring a hard fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Function: native_new_table_handle()] [Hash non-determinism] Are there any sources of non-determinism in SHA3-256 hashing (PRNG, timing, platform differences) that could cause validators to compute different handles? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Constants: ALREADY_EXISTS, NOT_FOUND] [Error category manipulation] Can the error category constants be manipulated or do they conflict with other error codes, causing incorrect error handling in Move contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/extensions/move-table-extension/src/lib.rs] [Constants: _NOT_EMPTY] [Unused error constant] The _NOT_EMPTY constant is prefixed with underscore suggesting it's unused - does this indicate missing validation logic for non-empty tables? (Medium)"
