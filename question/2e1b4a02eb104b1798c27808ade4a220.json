  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Total gas calculation] [Arithmetic Overflow] Can total gas consumption (execution + io + storage fee) overflow the maximum representable value, wrapping to zero and allowing unlimited execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Refund application] [Timing Attack] Can refunds be applied before final commitment, allowing attackers to claim refunds then cause transaction failure to avoid paying the charge? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Gas parameter updates] [Concurrent Modification] Can gas parameters be updated mid-transaction by governance, causing non-deterministic gas calculations between validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Storage fee timing] [Charge/Refund Ordering] Are storage fees charged before or after refunds are calculated, and can manipulation of this ordering enable double-spending of gas? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Transaction size limit] [Size Validation] Is there proper validation that txn_size parameters match actual transaction sizes, or can size misreporting bypass intrinsic gas charges? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Event emission limits] [Event Spam] Can attackers emit unlimited events by exploiting pricing bugs in charge_io_gas_for_event(), enabling storage spam attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Write set limits] [Write Spam] Can attackers create massive write sets by exploiting bugs in charge_io_gas_for_write(), enabling state bloat attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Dependency limits] [Dependency Chain Attack] Can attackers create circular or extremely long dependency chains that bypass count_dependency() limits through size manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Gas algebra consistency] [Algebra Invariant] Does the GasAlgebra trait enforce that the sum of all charges equals initial_balance - current_balance, or can inconsistencies create gas from nothing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Concurrent gas meters] [Thread Safety] If multiple transactions share gas meter components, can race conditions in the algebra layer cause non-deterministic gas charging? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Memory safety] [Use After Free] Can gas meter references outlive the underlying data structures, causing use-after-free vulnerabilities that corrupt gas accounting? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Trait object safety] [Dynamic Dispatch Attack] Can trait objects be manipulated to call incorrect implementations through vtable corruption, bypassing gas safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Associated type constraints] [Type Safety] Can the Algebra associated type be instantiated with types that don't properly implement GasAlgebra, bypassing trait safety? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-gas-meter/src/traits.rs] [Cross-version compatibility] [Upgrade Safety] When feature versions change, can old transactions with cached gas meters be re-executed with different results causing consensus splits? (Critical)"
