  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/string_utils.rs] [Function: native_format()] [Value Copy Cost] Does the read_ref() at line 576 properly account for the cost of copying large values from references, or can attackers force expensive deep copies without gas penalty? (Medium)",

  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/string_utils.rs] [Function: native_format_impl()] [Legacy Option Path] At lines 389-407, the legacy option handling path uses different logic than enum path - can this cause different validators to format the same option differently based on feature flag timing?
