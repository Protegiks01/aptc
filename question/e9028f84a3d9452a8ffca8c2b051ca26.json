  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Pool] [Memory Leak] Since the pool never evicts strings (as documented), can long-running validators accumulate unbounded memory usage, eventually causing OOM crashes during Move execution? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Bucket Growth] Is there any mechanism to rebalance buckets when linked lists become too long, or can uneven hash distribution cause pathological worst-case O(n) lookup performance? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/lib.rs] [Static: SYMBOL_POOL] [Pool Reset] Can the SYMBOL_POOL be safely reset or cleared in production without invalidating all existing Symbols, or would this cause mass memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/lib.rs] [Test: test_serialization] [Insufficient Coverage] Does the test at lines 41-56 adequately verify that Symbol serialization/deserialization is secure across process boundaries, or are there edge cases with malicious payloads? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Test: test_insert_identical_strings_have_the_same_entry] [Hash Collision] Does the test at lines 126-131 verify behavior with hash collisions (different strings, same hash), or only string equality? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Test: test_from_identical_strings_have_the_same_address] [Concurrency] Are there tests verifying thread-safe concurrent Symbol creation doesn't cause race conditions or pointer corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [UTF-8 Validation] Does string insertion validate UTF-8 encoding, or can attackers insert invalid UTF-8 sequences that cause panics or security issues when dereferenced? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: Deref::deref()] [String Safety] When dereferencing entry.string at line 76, is there validation that the Box<str> contains valid UTF-8, or can corruption lead to invalid string slices? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Unicode Normalization] Can Unicode normalization differences (NFC vs NFD) cause logically identical strings to be stored as separate entries, wasting memory and breaking string comparison semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Empty String] How is the empty string",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Large String] Are there size limits on inserted strings, or can attackers insert multi-GB strings that exhaust memory when boxed at line 106? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Struct: Symbol] [Zero Address] Can symbol pointer values legitimately be zero (violating NonZeroU64), or are there edge cases in pool allocation that could produce zero addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Type: Bucket] [Option None] When a bucket is None (line 49), does indexing at line 88 properly handle the empty case without panicking or causing undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Algorithmic Complexity] Can an attacker craft input strings that maximize linked list traversal at lines 91-101, causing O(n²) insertion performance and DoS during Move VM execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: hash()] [Hash Performance] Can expensive hash computations for pathological strings (e.g., very long strings with identical prefixes) cause DoS by slowing down Symbol creation? (Low)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/lib.rs] [Static: SYMBOL_POOL] [Lock Contention] Under high concurrency with many threads creating Symbols simultaneously, can mutex contention on SYMBOL_POOL at line 33 cause performance degradation affecting validator consensus participation? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: Deref::deref()] [Unsafe Block] Is the unsafe block at line 75 justified with proper safety comments, and has it been audited to ensure no undefined behavior can occur from dereferencing raw pointers? (High)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [Mutable References] Can obtaining mutable references to bucket entries at lines 88-100 while potentially aliasing with existing Symbol pointers violate Rust's aliasing rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Function: insert()] [NonNull Safety] Is the NonNull::from() conversion at line 110 safe when creating a pointer to a boxed value that will immediately be moved into the array? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/lib.rs] [Module: pool/symbol] [Encapsulation] Can external code access Pool or Entry types directly to manipulate the pool state, bypassing the safe Symbol interface? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/symbol.rs] [Function: From implementations] [Conversion Safety] Do the multiple From trait implementations (lines 50-68) properly validate input and handle edge cases like extremely long Cow::Owned strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: third_party/move/move-symbol-pool/src/pool.rs] [Struct: Pool] [Visibility] Is the Pool struct properly encapsulated as pub(crate) to prevent external manipulation, or can code outside this crate access internal pool state? (Low)"
