(Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/storage/aptosdb/src/db_debugger/state_kv/scan_snapshot.rs] [Function: worker thread] [Performance Degradation] Can maliciously slow database operations in corrupted or adversarial databases cause worker threads to stall indefinitely, preventing the scanner from completing and blocking debugging efforts?
