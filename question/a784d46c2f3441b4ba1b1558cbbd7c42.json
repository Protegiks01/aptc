  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Resource safety] [Resource duplication] Can GlobalResource or StorageLocation variants enable duplicate references to linear resources, violating Move's uniqueness guarantees? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Concurrency] [Data races] If AST structures are shared across threads, can concurrent modifications lead to data races despite PartialEq/Debug/Clone derivations? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Gas metering] [Spec evaluation cost] Are specification evaluations properly gas-metered, or can expensive specifications cause DoS by exhausting gas during verification? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Integer arithmetic] [Overflow in indices] Can FieldOrIndex::Index contain SpecExp that overflows during index calculation, causing wraparound to negative or extremely large indices? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Integer arithmetic] [Ret overflow] Can Ret(u8) overflow when cast to larger index types, causing incorrect return value access? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Error handling] [Panic safety] Do all operations on these types handle errors gracefully, or can malformed inputs cause panics that crash the prover/validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [Error handling] [Error propagation] Are errors in nested structures (Box, Vec) properly propagated, or can they be silently ignored leading to incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/move-ir/types/src/spec_language_ast.rs] [State consistency] [Snapshot isolation] Can Old() capture state that is later rolled back, allowing specifications to observe inconsistent state snapshots? (High)",
