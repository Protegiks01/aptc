  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: powers_of_tau()] [Field characteristic] For curves with small characteristic, can repeated tau squaring hit field order and cycle, creating a much shorter effective SRS than requested? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: powers_of_tau()] [Memory exhaustion] Can an attacker request n = usize::MAX causing Vec allocation of petabytes, leading to OOM kills and validator node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Powers function trust] Does utils::powers() properly handle edge cases like n=0 or n=1, or can these cause empty/singleton vectors that break downstream batch_mul assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: powers_of_tau()] [Powers consistency] If utils::powers() has a bug producing incorrect exponent sequences (e.g., tau, tau^2, tau^2, tau^4 with skip), can this break SRS structure without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Generic: CurveGroup] [Curve parameter injection] Can an attacker instantiate SrsBasis with a malicious CurveGroup implementation that has weak discrete log security, and does the module enforce allowed curve types? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Generic: CurveGroup] [Pairing compatibility] If the SRS is used in pairing-based schemes (KZG, Groth16), does the module ensure G1 and G2 generators are correctly paired, or can mismatched generators break soundness? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Generic: CurveGroup] [Twist security] For pairing-friendly curves, does the module validate that affine points are on the correct curve twist (not a quadratic/sextic twist with weaker security)? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Generic: ScalarField] [Field size mismatch] Can attackers exploit curves where |ScalarField| < |BaseField|, causing discrete log problems to be easier than expected and breaking commitment security? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Enum: SrsBasis] [Implicit conversion bug] If code incorrectly assumes Lagrange and PowersOfTau bases can be used interchangeably, can this lead to commitment verification failures or acceptance of invalid proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Basis verification] After constructing Lagrange basis, does any consumer verify the relationship between Lagrange and monomial coefficients, or can mismatched bases go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Enum: SrsBasis] [Clone safety] When cloning SrsBasis with large vectors, can this cause memory exhaustion or allow one component to modify shared underlying data affecting others? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Domain root validation] Does eval_dom contain valid n-th roots of unity for the scalar field, or can an attacker construct a domain with incorrect roots that cause IFFT to produce wrong results? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Domain offset] Does the function assume eval_dom.offset() is None (standard domain), or can non-standard coset domains cause incorrect Lagrange basis computation? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Domain size power] Can eval_dom.size() be artificially set to a power of 2 that doesn't match n, causing index mismatches between powers_of_tau and IFFT output? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: lagrange_basis()] [Constant-time violation] Does batch_mul() run in constant time, or can timing variations leak information about lagr_basis_scalars structure, indirectly revealing tau? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: powers_of_tau()] [Scalar-dependent timing] Can timing analysis of powers_of_tau() execution time reveal the Hamming weight or structure of tau, enabling partial key recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: check()] [Early return timing] Does the validation loop exit early on first invalid point, leaking information about which index failed and potentially revealing SRS structure? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: serialize_with_mode()] [Cache-timing leaks] Can cache access patterns during serialization leak whether SRS is Lagrange or PowersOfTau, or reveal vector lengths to cache-timing attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Struct: SrsBasis] [Interior mutability] Although Clone is derived, can interior mutability in C::Affine (e.g., cached projective coordinates) cause data races if SrsBasis is shared across threads? (High)",

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: powers_of_tau()] [Batch multiplication cost] Does batch_mul() have O(n²) or worse complexity that makes large n computationally infeasible, allowing DoS via SRS size inflation? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/srs.rs] [Function: check()] [Validation cost] For an SRS with millions of points, does validation in check() take excessive time, allowing attackers to send invalid SRS that tie up validation resources? (Medium)",
