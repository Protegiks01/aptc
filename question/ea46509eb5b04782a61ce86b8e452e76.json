  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: account_transactions] [Integer Overflow] Can the transaction_version field (Int8) overflow when processing a very high number of transactions, causing wrap-around and potential data corruption in account transaction history? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: account_transactions] [Missing Constraint] Does the schema enforce uniqueness on the composite key (account_address, transaction_version), or can duplicate entries corrupt the transaction history for an account? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: account_transactions] [Data Integrity] Can an attacker manipulate the inserted_at timestamp to reorder transaction history, potentially hiding malicious transactions or affecting audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: account_transactions] [Address Validation] The account_address field has max_length=66, but is there validation that addresses conform to Aptos address format (0x-prefixed hex), or can malformed addresses be inserted? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: block_metadata_transactions] [Integer Overflow] Can the version, block_height, round, or epoch fields (all Int8) overflow with sufficient blockchain growth, causing incorrect block metadata indexing? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: block_metadata_transactions] [Consensus Data Integrity] Can malformed previous_block_votes_bitvec (Jsonb) data corrupt consensus history, allowing validators to hide their voting behavior or manipulate participation records? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: block_metadata_transactions] [Validator Accountability] Can failed_proposer_indices (Jsonb) be manipulated to incorrectly attribute block proposal failures, protecting malicious validators from accountability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: block_metadata_transactions] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can the timestamp field be manipulated to create false consensus timing records, potentially hiding network attacks or performance issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: block_metadata_transactions] [Missing Uniqueness] Is there a unique constraint on version to prevent duplicate block metadata entries that could confuse consensus analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Numeric Overflow] Can the amount field (Numeric) overflow or underflow when processing extremely large coin transfers, causing incorrect balance calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Key Length Attack] The coin_type field allows up to 5000 characters - can an attacker create maliciously long coin type strings to cause database performance degradation or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Gas Fee Manipulation] Can the is_gas_fee boolean be incorrectly set to hide actual transaction costs or manipulate gas accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Transaction Success Inconsistency] Can is_transaction_success be set to true for failed transactions, hiding failed coin transfers and creating accounting discrepancies? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Event Index Attack] The event_index is Nullable - can missing event indices cause transaction ordering issues or allow event replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_activities] [Composite Key Integrity] Does the composite primary key properly prevent duplicate event processing that could lead to double-counting of coin movements? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_balances] [Balance Integrity] Can concurrent updates to coin_balances for the same owner_address and coin_type_hash at different transaction_versions create race conditions leading to incorrect balance states? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_balances] [Hash Collision] The coin_type_hash is limited to 64 characters - is this sufficient to prevent hash collisions that could merge balances of different coin types? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_balances] [Negative Balance] Does the amount field (Numeric) allow negative values, potentially enabling accounts to have negative balances? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_balances] [Timestamp Consistency] Can transaction_timestamp be out of order with transaction_version, causing balance history queries to return incorrect temporal data? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_infos] [Coin Creation Replay] Is coin_type_hash unique, or can the same coin be registered multiple times at different transaction_version_created values? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_infos] [Symbol/Name Length] The name field is limited to 32 characters and symbol to 10 - can truncation cause different coins to appear identical in UI? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_infos] [Decimals Overflow] The decimals field is Int4 - can values >18 cause overflow in amount calculations when converting between raw amounts and decimal representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_infos] [Supply Aggregator Nullability] Both supply_aggregator_table_handle and supply_aggregator_table_key are Nullable - can inconsistent null states corrupt supply tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_supply] [Supply Manipulation] Can supply (Numeric) be manipulated to show incorrect total coin supply, hiding unlimited minting or burning operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/schema.rs] [Table: coin_supply] [Epoch Consistency] Can transaction_epoch be inconsistent with transaction_version, causing supply history to be incorrectly attributed to wrong epochs? (Medium)"
