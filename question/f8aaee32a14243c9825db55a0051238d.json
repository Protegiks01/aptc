  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Index Validation] Is write_set_change_index validated to be non-negative and within reasonable bounds, or can extreme values cause database issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Index Uniqueness] Within a transaction, is write_set_change_index guaranteed unique for each MoveResource, or can duplicates cause primary key constraint violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Delete Index Order] If delete operations don't use consecutive write_set_change_index values, can this cause ordering issues when reconstructing transaction execution order? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Type String Forgery] Can an attacker craft a type_ string that looks like a system resource type (e.g., '0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>') but actually references attacker-controlled code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: convert_move_struct_tag()] [Generic Parameter Injection] When converting generic_type_params, can an attacker inject types that bypass Move VM safety checks but appear valid in the indexer? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Type Aliasing Attack] If two different Move types serialize to the same type_ string, can this cause resource confusion where the indexer treats different types as identical? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Checksum Missing] There's no checksum or integrity verification of the data field - can database corruption or bit flips go undetected, serving invalid resource data to applications? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Tamper Detection] If an attacker gains database access and modifies MoveResource entries, is there any mechanism to detect tampering and reject corrupted data? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Audit Trail] Are changes to MoveResource entries logged for audit purposes, or can malicious modifications go undetected? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Transaction Reference] The Associations trait references Transaction table - if the parent Transaction is deleted, are dependent MoveResource entries cascaded deleted or orphaned? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Orphaned Resources] Can MoveResource entries exist in database without a corresponding Transaction entry, breaking referential integrity and causing query errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_write_resource()] [Null Byte Injection] Can string fields (name, type_, address, module) contain null bytes that truncate strings in C/C++ systems querying the database, hiding parts of the data? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Function: from_delete_resource()] [Resource Resurrection] If a deleted resource (is_deleted=true) is later written again, does the indexer properly update is_deleted to false, or does it remain incorrectly marked as deleted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/indexer/src/models/move_resources.rs] [Struct: MoveResource] [Schema Evolution] If the MoveResource struct or database schema changes, is there migration logic to handle existing data, or can schema changes break the indexer? (Low)"
