  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [State divergence] Can a malicious validator enqueue chunks with crafted PartialStateComputeResult that causes latest_state to diverge from latest_state_summary and latest_txn_accumulator, leading to state root mismatch across validators and consensus failure? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Atomicity violation] If save_ledger_update_output() fails after updating latest_state_summary but before updating latest_txn_accumulator, does this create inconsistent state between the three critical fields (latest_state, latest_state_summary, latest_txn_accumulator) that could cause validators to produce different state commitments? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_update_ledger()] [Race condition] Can concurrent calls to next_chunk_to_update_ledger() by multiple threads cause the same chunk to be taken twice via the Option::take() pattern, leading to duplicate ledger updates and state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [State desynchronization] Since latest_state is updated in enqueue_for_ledger_update() but latest_state_summary and latest_txn_accumulator are updated later in save_ledger_update_output(), can a crash or error between these stages cause permanent state divergence requiring hardfork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Double-spending] If ensure_state_checkpoint_output() or ensure_ledger_update_output() can be bypassed or return forged data, could an attacker commit invalid state_summary or transaction_accumulator values that enable double-spending attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_commit()] [Verification bypass] Since ChunkResultVerifier is only stored in ChunkToUpdateLedger but verification is never explicitly called before commit, can chunks bypass verification entirely and commit invalid transactions to the ledger? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [Version gap attack] If enqueue_for_ledger_update() accepts chunks with non-sequential versions, can an attacker create gaps in the version sequence that cause expecting_version() to skip transactions and enable replay attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_committed()] [Reorg vulnerability] If dequeue_committed() is called but the chunk was never actually persisted to disk due to storage failure, does the queue state advance while the database remains behind, causing state divergence on restart? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkToUpdateLedger] [Chunk verifier manipulation] Can the chunk_verifier field be replaced with a malicious verifier implementation that always returns success, allowing invalid chunks to pass verification and corrupt blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Accumulator forgery] If the transaction_accumulator in ExecutedChunk.output can be manipulated to contain fraudulent transaction hashes, can validators with < 1/3 Byzantine nodes commit conflicting transaction histories? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_update_ledger()] [Double processing] Can next_chunk_to_update_ledger() be called twice on the same chunk before save_ledger_update_output() is called, allowing the same chunk to be processed twice with different accumulator/summary states causing state fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Queue ordering violation] Can save_ledger_update_output() be called with chunks out-of-order relative to next_chunk_to_update_ledger() calls, causing chunks to be moved to to_commit queue in wrong sequence and breaking version ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_commit()] [Premature commit] Can next_chunk_to_commit() be called before save_ledger_update_output() completes for a chunk, allowing commits with unverified or incomplete ledger updates that corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: dequeue_committed()] [Skip commit attack] Can dequeue_committed() be called multiple times to skip chunks in to_commit queue without actually committing them, causing transaction loss and fund freezing? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Pipeline bypass] Can chunks be added directly to to_commit queue without going through to_update_ledger, bypassing ledger update stage and committing chunks with invalid accumulator/summary? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Missing synchronization] Since ChunkCommitQueue has no internal locks or synchronization primitives, can concurrent access from multiple executor threads cause data races on latest_state, to_commit, or to_update_ledger fields? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: enqueue_for_ledger_update()] [State update race] Can concurrent enqueue_for_ledger_update() calls interleave latest_state updates with queue operations, causing latest_state to reflect a different version than the last chunk in to_update_ledger? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [TOCTOU vulnerability] Between checking to_update_ledger.front().unwrap().is_none() and calling pop_front(), can another thread modify the queue causing time-of-check-time-of-use race condition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: latest_state()] [Stale read] Can latest_state() return stale data if called concurrently with enqueue_for_ledger_update() that's updating latest_state, causing validators to execute against wrong base state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: expecting_version()] [Version race] Can expecting_version() return incorrect version if called during enqueue_for_ledger_update() while latest_state.next_version() is being computed, causing version conflicts? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_update_ledger()] [Clone race] Can cloning latest_state_summary and latest_txn_accumulator race with updates in save_ledger_update_output(), returning inconsistent snapshot of queue state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [ABA problem] Can is_empty() check pass, then chunks be added/removed/added again before the result is used, causing incorrect assumptions about queue state in caller code? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Struct: ChunkCommitQueue] [Non-atomic multi-field update] Since save_ledger_update_output() updates latest_state_summary, latest_txn_accumulator, pops to_update_ledger and pushes to_commit in separate steps, can crashes mid-update leave queues in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: save_ledger_update_output()] [Panic on ensure failure] If ensure_state_checkpoint_output() or ensure_ledger_update_output() returns error after latest_state_summary is partially updated, does the error handling properly rollback all state changes or leave queue corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/execution/executor/src/chunk_executor/chunk_commit_queue.rs] [Function: next_chunk_to_update_ledger()] [Option unwrap panic] Can the ok_or_else() checks be bypassed if to_update_ledger contains an unexpected None value at the front, causing panic and validator crash? (High)"
