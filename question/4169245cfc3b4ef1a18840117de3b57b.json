  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Trait: IncomingRequest] [Cross-protocol attacks] Since IncomingRequest is implemented by both RpcRequest and DirectSendMsg, can attackers exploit common deserialization logic to trigger vulnerabilities across protocol boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Struct: ParsingErrorType] [Insufficient error info] ParsingErrorType only stores message and protocol bytes (both u8) at lines 86-88 - is this enough information to properly diagnose and block malicious peers, or can attackers evade detection? (Low)",

  "[File: aptos-core/network/framework/src/protocols/wire/messaging/v1/mod.rs] [Function: NetworkMessage::data_len()] [Incomplete size accounting] The data_len() method at line 57 only counts raw data - does this exclude header overhead, and can attackers exploit this to bypass total message size limits?
