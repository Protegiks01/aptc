  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/move_types.rs] [Constant: PRIMARY_FUNGIBLE_STORE_MODULE] [Store creation] Can PRIMARY_FUNGIBLE_STORE_MODULE operations create stores for arbitrary fungible assets, and does Rosetta distinguish between legitimate and malicious fungible asset stores when reporting balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/move_types.rs] [Constant: DISPATCHABLE_FUNGIBLE_ASSET_MODULE] [Dispatch hooks] Does DISPATCHABLE_FUNGIBLE_ASSET_MODULE support custom transfer hooks, and can these hooks cause Rosetta to misreport transfer amounts if pre/post conditions modify the actual transferred value? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/move_types.rs] [Constant: OBJECT_CORE_RESOURCE] [Core resource validation] Does Rosetta validate that OBJECT_CORE_RESOURCE exists before parsing object-based resources, or can missing ObjectCore cause deserialization failures that crash the API endpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-rosetta/src/types/move_types.rs] [Constant: FUNGIBLE_STORE_RESOURCE] [Balance aggregation] When an account has multiple FungibleStore resources for different assets, does Rosetta properly aggregate balances, or can overlapping store queries cause double-counting of fungible asset holdings? (High)"
