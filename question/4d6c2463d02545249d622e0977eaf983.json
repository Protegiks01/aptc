  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: error] [Error Information Leakage] When logging Error::StorageErrorEncountered or Error::UnexpectedErrorEncountered, can the detailed error strings expose internal storage structure or panic messages that aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: error] [Error Injection] Can malicious peers trigger specific error conditions (InvalidRequest with crafted messages) that when logged, inject misleading error information to hide other attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry::PeerMonitoringServiceError] [Error Classification] Does the error log entry properly classify different error severities, or can critical security failures be masked as routine errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Timing Side-Channel] Can attackers measure the time taken to log different types of requests/responses to infer internal processing logic or identify high-value targets? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Method: new()] [Allocation Side-Channel] Does the LogSchema::new() constructor's allocation pattern reveal information about request types through memory allocation timing that can be observed via cache timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: message] [Input Validation] Are message strings validated for maximum length before logging, or can attackers send unbounded message strings causing log file corruption or disk exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: response] [Output Encoding] When logging response data as strings, is proper encoding (UTF-8 validation) enforced to prevent invalid unicode sequences from corrupting logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Null Byte Injection] Can attackers inject null bytes into logged strings (message, response) that truncate log entries prematurely, hiding subsequent malicious activity? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Enum Exhaustiveness] If new variants are added to LogEntry in the future, will the serialization logic handle them safely, or can unhandled enum variants cause panics during logging? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Enum: LogEntry] [Discriminant Collision] Could the serde rename_all snake_case transformation cause discriminant collisions if poorly named variants are added, leading to ambiguous log entries? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Level Bypass] Can the logging system's level filtering be bypassed by crafting requests that trigger multiple log entries at different levels, circumventing rate limiting on high-verbosity logs? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Log Rotation Attack] If log rotation is based on file size and LogSchema doesn't enforce entry size limits, can attackers force premature log rotation to evict forensic evidence? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [PII Leakage] Does LogSchema inadvertently log personally identifiable information (IP addresses, network addresses) without proper anonymization, violating privacy regulations like GDPR? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Retention Policy] Are there mechanisms to enforce log retention policies on sensitive peer monitoring data, or can logs persist indefinitely exposing historical network topology? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: request] [Cross-Service Correlation] If multiple services log PeerMonitoringServiceRequest objects, can request correlation across services reveal security-sensitive patterns about validator behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: response] [Log Aggregation Attack] When logs from multiple nodes are aggregated for monitoring, can attackers craft responses that cause log aggregation systems to misattribute malicious activity to innocent nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: request] [Request Cloning Cost] Since PeerMonitoringServiceRequest must be cloned or referenced for logging, can high-frequency requests with large payloads cause performance degradation through excessive cloning? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Field: response] [Response Size Explosion] Can malicious peers trigger responses (NetworkInformationResponse with all connected peers) that when logged cause log entries to exceed buffer sizes and trigger truncation or loss? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Method: new()] [Incomplete Initialization] Can developers misuse LogSchema::new() by forgetting to set critical fields (request, error) before logging, leading to incomplete audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/peer-monitoring-service/server/src/logging.rs] [Struct: LogSchema] [Field Setter Safety] Are there setter methods (implied by the Option fields) that validate field values before setting them, or can invalid/malicious data be injected directly into log fields? (Low)",
