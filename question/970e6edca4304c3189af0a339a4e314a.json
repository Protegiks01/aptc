  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Panic Safety] If a panic occurs during TUI rendering after line 47, will cleanup code run to restore terminal state, or will the terminal remain in an unusable state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Test: verify_tool()] [Test Coverage] Does the verify_tool test at line 65-67 actually test security properties, or does it only verify the CLI argument structure, leaving security vulnerabilities untested? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Test: verify_tool()] [Fuzz Testing] Has the bytecode deserialization path been fuzz-tested with malformed inputs, or could there be crash bugs or vulnerabilities in handling malicious bytecode that the single test doesn't cover? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BytecodeViewerConfig] [CLI Injection] Can attackers inject malicious arguments via the clap Parser at lines 23-37 to override intended paths or inject unexpected command-line flags? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BytecodeViewerConfig] [Argument Validation] Does the CLI parser validate that required arguments are present and valid before start_viewer() is called, or can missing/invalid arguments cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Struct: BytecodeViewerConfig] [Short Flag Conflicts] Could the short flags -b and -s at lines 27 and 35 conflict with other tools or flags if this viewer is integrated into a larger CLI application? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [General] [Production Misuse] If this development tool is accidentally deployed to production validator nodes, could attackers exploit it to view sensitive bytecode, cause DoS via crafted files, or exhaust resources? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [General] [Privilege Escalation] If the viewer runs with elevated privileges, could file read vulnerabilities be exploited to read sensitive system files like validator keys or configuration files? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Audit Logging] Does the viewer log which files are being accessed, or can attackers use it to read sensitive files without detection? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [General] [Access Control] Is there any access control on which users can run this tool, or can any user with system access view arbitrary Move bytecode files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Empty Files] How does the viewer handle empty bytecode files or files with only header data - does it panic, hang, or gracefully handle the edge case? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Truncated Files] Can truncated or partially written bytecode files cause deserialization to read beyond buffer bounds or enter infinite loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Large Modules] For extremely large compiled modules with thousands of functions, does the viewer handle performance degradation gracefully, or can it become unresponsive? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Binary Garbage] If provided with completely random binary data instead of valid bytecode, does the deserializer at line 54-55 safely reject it, or can it enter unexpected code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Path Separator] Are Windows-style path separators (backslash) properly handled on Unix systems and vice versa, or can path parsing issues cause security vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [File Encoding] Does fs::read() handle different file system encodings correctly, or can encoding mismatches cause data corruption when reading bytecode files? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Terminal Capabilities] Does the TUI initialization at line 47 properly detect terminal capabilities across different platforms, or can it crash on unsupported terminals? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Data Flow] Can the flow from file read (line 53) → deserialize (line 54-55) → viewer creation (line 60) be exploited by inserting malicious data at any stage to corrupt subsequent stages? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer_in_memory()] [Control Flow] Can the control flow be hijacked after viewer creation at line 46 to prevent start_tui_with_interface() from being called, leaving resources in an inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Error Propagation] If source_map_from_file() at line 57 returns an error, does the unwrap() properly clean up the already-loaded bytecode and source data, or can resource leaks occur? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Compression Bomb] If bytecode files can be compressed, could an attacker provide a compression bomb that expands to enormous size when loaded via fs::read() at line 53? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/third_party/move/tools/move-bytecode-viewer/src/lib.rs] [Function: start_viewer()] [Format String] Do any error messages use user-controlled file paths in format strings that could lead to format string vulnerabilities or injection attacks? (Low)",
