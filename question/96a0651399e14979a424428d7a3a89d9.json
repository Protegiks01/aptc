  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [Unknown Reason Abuse] Can a Byzantine validator spam RoundTimeoutReason::Unknown (line 18) to force honest validators to timeout without providing diagnostic information, making consensus debugging impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [PayloadUnavailable BitVec] In PayloadUnavailable variant at line 20, can the missing_authors BitVec be crafted to exceed memory limits or cause integer overflow when calculating missing validator count? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [Reason Forgery] Can an attacker change a timeout's reason from NoQC to ProposalNotReceived after signature verification to manipulate consensus metrics and hide actual network issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [BitVec Size Attack] For PayloadUnavailable, can missing_authors BitVec be set to a size larger than the validator set, causing out-of-bounds access when processing timeout aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [Serialization Manipulation] Can the RoundTimeoutReason enum be deserialized with invalid discriminants (not 0-3) due to unsafe deserialization, causing undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Enum: RoundTimeoutReason] [Display Format Injection] In the Display impl at lines 24-35, can special characters in the reason cause log injection attacks when timeout messages are logged? (Low)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: timeout] [TwoChainTimeout Delegation] Does RoundTimeout properly validate that the embedded TwoChainTimeout at line 40 has internally consistent epoch, round, and quorum_cert fields before signature verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: timeout] [Epoch Extraction] The epoch() method at lines 81-83 delegates to timeout.epoch() - can this return a different epoch than what was signed, enabling epoch confusion attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: timeout] [Round Extraction] The round() method at lines 85-87 delegates to timeout.round() - can an attacker exploit this indirection to return different rounds in verify() vs round() calls? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: timeout] [HQC Round Access] The two_chain_timeout() method at line 89-91 returns a reference - can concurrent modifications to the underlying TwoChainTimeout cause race conditions during verification? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: timeout] [Signing Format Consistency] When verify() calls timeout.signing_format() at line 102, is there a guarantee this format is immutable and cannot change between signing and verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: author] [Author Spoofing] The author field at line 41 is used in verification at line 101 - can an attacker claim to be any validator author and bypass signature checks if the ValidatorVerifier doesn't properly map authors to public keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: author] [Author Validation] Does the author() getter at lines 93-95 perform any validation, or can it return an invalid/corrupted Author that breaks assumptions in consensus processing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: author] [Author Uniqueness] Can two RoundTimeout messages with identical timeout/reason/signature but different authors both verify successfully, allowing double-timeout attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: signature] [BLS Signature Storage] The signature field at line 44 stores a bls12381::Signature - can this be corrupted in memory without detection, causing verify() to succeed with invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: signature] [Signature Getter] The signature() method at lines 113-115 returns a reference - can an attacker obtain this reference and modify the signature after verification but before consensus processing? (High)",
  "[File: consensus/consensus-types/src/round_timeout.rs] [Field: signature] [Zero Signature] Can a RoundTimeout be constructed with a zero/empty BLS signature that accidentally verifies due to signature aggregation edge cases? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
