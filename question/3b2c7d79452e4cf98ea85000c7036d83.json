  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Highest Timeout Invariant] Can highest_timeout_round be manipulated to values lower than previously observed timeouts, breaking order vote safety rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Epoch Transition Safety] Does the interface enforce that safety_data is reset to initial values (0 for rounds) when transitioning to a new epoch, or can stale round numbers persist across epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [QC Observation Order] Can out-of-order QC observations cause preferred_round and one_chain_round to be updated incorrectly, violating voting safety rules? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Private Key Exposure] Does the interface prevent implementations from logging or exposing private keys in error messages or debug output? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Signature Randomness] Can implementations use deterministic or weak randomness for BLS signature generation, enabling signature prediction or forgery attacks? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Key Derivation] Does the interface specify secure key derivation from storage, or can implementations use weak derivation that compromises private keys? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Signature Verification Order] Can implementations return signatures before fully validating input data, creating windows where invalid signatures are generated for malicious proposals? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Multiple Signers] If a validator has multiple signing keys, can implementations sign with the wrong key, creating invalid signatures that waste network bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Uninitialized Operations] Can sign_proposal(), construct_and_sign_vote_two_chain(), or other methods be called before initialize() completes, operating on uninitialized state and producing invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Storage Failure Recovery] If persistent_storage operations fail mid-update, can implementations recover safely or will they have corrupted safety_data that violates invariants? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Byzantine Proposal Handling] Does the interface specify how implementations should handle clearly Byzantine proposals (conflicting data, invalid signatures), or can implementations crash/panic instead of returning errors? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Memory Exhaustion] Can processing large VoteProposal or OrderVoteProposal objects with deeply nested QCs cause memory exhaustion and validator crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Validator Set Changes] Does the interface handle validator set changes mid-epoch, or can implementations accept proposals signed by validators no longer in the active set? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Fast Forward Sync] When validators fast-forward to a new epoch via sync, does the interface ensure safety_data is properly initialized from the latest committed state? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/consensus/safety-rules/src/t_safety_rules.rs] [Trait: TSafetyRules] [Commit Certificate Verification] Does sign_commit_vote() verify that the old ledger_info represents a valid ordered certificate before allowing the commit transition? (Critical)"
