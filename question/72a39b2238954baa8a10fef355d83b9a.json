  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pool_state()] [State Ambiguity] If a pool_address appears in multiple validator sets (active, pending_active, pending_inactive) due to on-chain bugs, which state wins, and can this cause incorrect operator decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: get_stake_pool_state()] [Missing State Validation] Are the validator set arrays (active, pending_active, pending_inactive) validated for duplicates, or can on-chain corruption place a pool in multiple states simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeValidator::execute()] [Network Address Mismatch] Lines 627-639 construct validator network addresses - if validator_host and validator_network_public_key are mismatched (from different sources), can this create un-connectable validators causing network partition? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeValidator::execute()] [Fullnode Address Validation] Lines 630-639 have inconsistent validation for fullnode addresses - if only host OR only public_key is provided (but not both), does it correctly error, or can partial configurations be submitted? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeValidator::execute()] [BCS Serialization Attack] Lines 646-647 BCS-encode network addresses - can oversized or maliciously crafted NetworkAddress vectors cause BCS serialization failures or consume excessive gas when submitted on-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeValidator::execute()] [Consensus Key Reuse] Is there validation preventing an operator from initializing multiple validators with the same consensus_public_key, which would break consensus quorum calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: InitializeValidator::execute()] [Proof of Possession Bypass] Does the on-chain stake_initialize_validator function actually verify the PoP, or does this CLI just pass it through trusting on-chain validation that might have bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: OperatorArgs::address_fallback_to_profile()] [Address Confusion] If pool_address is None and profile has no account, does this return a clear error, or can it return a default address (like 0x0) causing transactions to target wrong validator? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: OperatorArgs::address_fallback_to_txn()] [Transaction Sender Confusion] If pool_address is None and transaction options have no sender configured, can this send validator operations to an unintended address or cause transaction rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: JoinValidatorSet::execute()] [Insufficient Stake Check] Does this CLI validate minimum stake requirements before submitting the transaction, or can it submit transactions that will fail on-chain wasting gas fees? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: JoinValidatorSet::execute()] [Wrong Pool Attack] If address resolution via address_fallback_to_txn() returns the wrong pool address, can an operator accidentally join the validator set with someone else's pool? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: JoinValidatorSet::execute()] [Validator Config Validation] Is there pre-flight validation that the validator has properly configured consensus keys and network addresses before joining, or can incomplete validators join causing consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: LeaveValidatorSet::execute()] [Locked Stake Warning] Does the CLI warn users if they have locked stake that prevents leaving, or can they submit failing transactions wasting gas? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: LeaveValidatorSet::execute()] [Address Resolution Failure] If the operator accidentally leaves the wrong validator pool due to address_fallback_to_txn() confusion, could this cause unintended validator exits affecting network security? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ShowValidatorStake::execute()] [Resource Existence Check] Does line 771 handle the case where StakePool resource doesn't exist gracefully, or does it panic/error in a way that could be exploited for reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ShowValidatorConfig::execute()] [BCS Deserialization] Line 802-805 deserializes ValidatorConfig via BCS - can malformed on-chain data cause deserialization errors revealing internal state or causing crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ShowValidatorConfig::execute()] [Type Conversion Error] Line 806-808 uses try_into() to convert to ValidatorConfigSummary - what happens if conversion fails, and can malicious on-chain data exploit this? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ShowValidatorSet::execute()] [Large Validator Set DoS] If the validator set grows to thousands of validators, does line 837 handle this efficiently, or can it cause memory exhaustion or timeout when converting to summary format? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorSetSummary::convert_to_summary_vec()] [Partial Conversion Failure] Lines 857-862 convert validators one-by-one with early return on first error - if one validator has corrupted data, does this hide all other valid validators in the output?

  "[File: aptos-core/crates/aptos/src/node/mod.rs] [Function: ValidatorSetSummary::try_from()] [Clone Performance] Lines 872-876 clone entire validator vectors - for large validator sets, could this cause performance issues or memory exhaustion? (Low)",
