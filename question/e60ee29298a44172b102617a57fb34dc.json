  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Function: from_u64_internal() line 36] [Type tag caching] The structure_from_ty_arg! macro calls context.type_to_type_tag(). If type tags are cached, can stale cache entries cause type confusion between transactions? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 23] [Gas meter concurrency] The gas charging at line 23 modifies SafeNativeContext gas state. Can concurrent gas charges from parallel transactions interfere, causing under-charging or double-charging? (High)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Function: from_u64_internal() line 37] [Feature flag check TOCTOU] Between checking feature flags at line 37 and executing the match at lines 38-66, can a concurrent feature flag update cause a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 25] [Vector reallocation race] When target_vec.push() at line 25 causes vector reallocation, can concurrent reads via safe_borrow_element! from other operations access invalid memory? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Function: from_u64_internal() entire function] [Session start/finish races] If AlgebraContext.start() or .finish() is called concurrently with from_u64_internal(), can context.objs be cleared while handles are still being used, causing use-after-free? (Critical)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 20-28] [Variable capture] The macro uses $context, $args, $typ, and $gas. Can these macro variables accidentally capture identifiers from the calling scope, causing unexpected behavior or security issues? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 22] [safely_pop_arg expansion] The safely_pop_arg! macro is called within from_u64_internal! macro. Can nested macro expansions cause incorrect error handling or bypass safety checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 25] [store_element expansion timing] The store_element! macro is called at line 25. Can its expansion be delayed by compiler optimizations, causing the element to be used before it's properly stored? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 24] [Type parameter hygiene] The $typ:ty parameter is used directly in <$typ>::from(). Can this create ambiguity if $typ contains special characters or path separators that break type resolution? (Low)",
  "[File: aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/src/natives/cryptography/algebra/new.rs] [Macro: from_u64_internal! line 23] [Gas parameter mutation] The $gas parameter is passed to charge(). If $gas is a mutable expression, can the charge() call modify it, affecting subsequent macro invocations? (Low)",
