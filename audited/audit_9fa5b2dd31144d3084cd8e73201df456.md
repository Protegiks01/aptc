I cannot complete this security audit because the **Security Question** provided in your query is incomplete. 

The query shows:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/crates/

The security question cuts off mid-sentence and does not specify what vulnerability or security concern I should be investigating in the Aptos Core codebase.

To perform a thorough security audit following the requirements you've outlined, I need:

1. **A complete security question** that defines the specific attack surface, vulnerability type, or security concern to investigate
2. **Specific scope** (which files, components, or attack vectors to focus on)
3. **Clear hypothesis** about what potential vulnerability or invariant violation to explore

The citation you provided references `crates/aptos-rosetta/src/client.rs` [1](#0-0) , which contains the Rosetta API client implementation, but without knowing what specific security concern to investigate (e.g., "Can the Rosetta API client be exploited to bypass transaction validation?"), I cannot proceed with the analysis.

Please provide the complete security question so I can conduct the audit according to your specifications.
