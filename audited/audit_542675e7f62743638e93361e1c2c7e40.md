I am unable to complete this security audit as requested. 

## Limitation Explanation

The security question asks me to determine whether the `prometheus` crate (version 0.13.3) [1](#0-0)  or `aptos-metrics-core` [2](#0-1)  contain known CVEs allowing remote code execution, DoS, or metric manipulation.

**What I can confirm from the codebase:**
- The `storage/indexer/src/metrics.rs` file depends on `aptos-metrics-core` 
- The `aptos-metrics-core` crate depends on `prometheus` [3](#0-2) 
- The workspace specifies `prometheus` version 0.13.3 [1](#0-0) 

**Why I cannot answer this question:**

Determining whether specific versions of third-party dependencies contain known CVEs requires access to external vulnerability databases such as:
- RustSec Advisory Database (https://rustsec.org/)
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- GitHub Security Advisories  
- Crates.io security reports

These resources are **not part of the codebase** and are **not accessible** through the tools I have (codebase search, file reading, pattern matching). 

My current capabilities are limited to analyzing code, logic, and data flows within the repository itself. Checking for published CVEs in external dependencies is beyond my scope as a codebase analysis tool.

**To properly answer this question, you would need to:**
1. Run `cargo audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
2. Query the RustSec Advisory Database directly
3. Check security advisories for prometheus crate version 0.13.3
4. Review any published CVEs for the specific version in use

I cannot fabricate or speculate about CVE existence without access to authoritative vulnerability databases.
