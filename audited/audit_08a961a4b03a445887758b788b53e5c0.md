I cannot answer this security question as posed because it requires information not available in the codebase itself.

## Limitation Explanation

The security question asks whether the imported crates (anyhow, clap, aptos-rosetta, aptos-types) are "at secure versions without known vulnerabilities." 

From the codebase, I can identify the dependency versions:
- `anyhow = "1.0.98"` [1](#0-0) 
- `clap = { version = "4.3.9", features = [...] }` [2](#0-1) 
- `aptos-rosetta` and `aptos-types` are internal workspace crates [3](#0-2) 

These dependencies are used in the account balance query functionality [4](#0-3) 

However, **determining whether these specific versions have "known vulnerabilities" requires access to external vulnerability databases** such as:
- RustSec Advisory Database (rustsec.org)
- CVE databases
- GitHub Security Advisories
- crates.io security advisories

The codebase does not contain this vulnerability information. As stated in my capabilities: I can only answer questions about the current codebase and do not have access to external security databases or vulnerability tracking systems.

## What I Can Verify

I can verify that the dependencies are used in standard, non-obviously-vulnerable ways in the balance query code path [5](#0-4) , but I cannot verify whether the dependency versions themselves have published CVEs.

**This security audit question is outside my current capabilities.**
