I cannot perform the security audit because the security question is incomplete. 

The query shows:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/crates/aptos-crypto/src/arkworks/shamir.

The question cuts off mid-sentence and does not specify what security vulnerability or concern I should be investigating in the Shamir secret sharing implementation.

To conduct a proper security audit, I need the complete security question that specifies:
- What specific vulnerability or security concern to investigate
- What attack vector or invariant violation to analyze
- What security property of the Shamir secret sharing implementation to examine

Without a complete security question, I cannot:
1. Determine the scope of the investigation
2. Identify relevant code paths to analyze
3. Assess potential attack vectors
4. Validate findings against the specified concern
5. Produce a meaningful audit report

**Please provide the complete security question so I can perform the requested security analysis.**
