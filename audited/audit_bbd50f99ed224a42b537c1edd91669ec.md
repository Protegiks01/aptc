I cannot proceed with this security audit because the **Security Question** is incomplete. The prompt states:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-labs/aptos-core

This appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not provide the actual security question or vulnerability hypothesis I should investigate.

To perform the requested security audit, I need:

1. **A complete security question** - What specific vulnerability, attack vector, or security concern should I investigate? For example:
   - "Can a malicious transaction bypass gas metering in the Move VM?"
   - "Can an attacker manipulate voting power through stake pool bugs?"
   - "Can validators cause consensus divergence through X mechanism?"
   - "Can state sync be exploited to corrupt the Jellyfish Merkle tree?"

2. **Scope clarification** - Which specific component(s) or attack surface should be the focus?

Without a defined security question, I cannot:
- Determine which code paths to analyze
- Identify relevant invariants to check
- Validate whether any findings are in scope
- Produce a meaningful audit report

**Please provide the complete security question so I can conduct the thorough security analysis you've requested.**
