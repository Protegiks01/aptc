I cannot perform the security audit as requested because **the security question is incomplete**. 

The prompt states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core

This appears to be cut off and does not contain an actual security question for me to investigate.

To perform a thorough security analysis of the Aptos Core codebase, I need:

1. **A complete security question** that defines the specific vulnerability scenario or attack vector to investigate
2. **Clear scope** of which components or invariants to focus on
3. **Specific concerns** about the cited file (`crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/v2_token_utils.rs`) if relevant

**Note about the cited file:**

The file shown (`crates/indexer/src/models/token_models/v2_token_utils.rs`) is part of the **indexer component**, which:
- Processes blockchain data for off-chain indexing
- Does not participate in consensus
- Does not execute transactions or affect validator nodes
- Is not part of the critical security path (consensus, Move VM, state management, governance, staking)

Vulnerabilities in the indexer would typically not meet Critical or High severity criteria as they cannot directly cause loss of funds, consensus violations, or network failures.

**Please provide the complete security question so I can conduct the requested audit.**
