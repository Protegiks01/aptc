I notice that the **Security Question** in your prompt appears to be incomplete. The prompt states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-labs/aptos-core

But no actual security question follows this line. The security question seems to have been cut off.

To perform the security audit you've requested, I need you to provide:

1. **The complete security question** - What specific vulnerability scenario, attack vector, or security concern should I investigate?
2. **Any specific files or components** you want me to focus on (if applicable to the question)

Without a specific security question to investigate, I cannot:
- Determine which code paths to analyze
- Identify relevant attack surfaces
- Search for specific vulnerability patterns
- Validate whether any findings are related to the question's scope

Please provide the complete security question, and I'll conduct a thorough investigation following all the validation criteria and reporting requirements you've outlined.
