I cannot perform a security audit based on the provided query because the **Security Question** is incomplete. 

The query states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/aptos-move/

This appears to be cut off mid-sentence. To conduct a thorough security investigation as requested, I need:

1. **The complete security question** - What specific vulnerability, attack vector, or security concern should I investigate?
2. **The specific scope** - What aspect of the JWK consensus config or other components should be analyzed?
3. **The attack scenario** - What invariant violation or exploit path should I trace?

The citation provided shows code from `jwk_consensus_config.rs` [1](#0-0) , but without knowing what security issue to investigate in this file, I cannot proceed with the audit.

**Please provide:**
- The complete security question you'd like me to investigate
- Any specific concerns about JWK consensus configuration, governance proposals, or related components
- The type of vulnerability you suspect (consensus manipulation, governance bypass, etc.)

Once I have the complete question, I can perform a thorough investigation following the elite auditor methodology outlined in your instructions.
