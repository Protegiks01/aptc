I cannot complete this security audit as requested. After thorough investigation, I've determined that the target of this security question—**TradePort V2's marketplace contract**—is not part of the Aptos Core codebase.

## Analysis Summary

**What I Found:**

The referenced file contains only test transaction data, not Move source code: [1](#0-0) 

This constant loads a JSON file with a mainnet transaction that calls `0xe11c12ec495f3989c35e1c6a0af414451223305b579291fc8f3d9d0575a23c26::biddings_v2::unlist_and_accept_token_bid`: [2](#0-1) 

**TradePort V2 is a third-party deployed smart contract** on Aptos mainnet. Its Move source code does not exist in the `aptos-core` repository—only test transaction data imported for indexer testing purposes.

I analyzed the Aptos marketplace example code as a proxy: [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) 

This example code appears properly protected against offer double-spending through Move's transaction atomicity and Block-STM validation, but it is **not the same contract** referenced in the security question.

## Conclusion

**This audit request is outside my current capabilities.** I can only analyze code that exists within the provided repository. To audit TradePort V2 for the described vulnerability, I would need access to its Move source code, which is not available in `aptos-core`.

The prompt instructions state: *"If you are unable to answer the prompt with the tools provided to you, do not try to give an answer, simply explain in a brief response that this is not in your current capabilities."*

**I cannot audit a third-party deployed contract without access to its source code.**
