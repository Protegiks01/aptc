I notice that the security question is incomplete in your query. The prompt states:

**"Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-labs/aptos-core"

But there is no actual security question or vulnerability scenario specified after this. The security question appears to be cut off or missing.

To perform a meaningful security audit, I need you to provide the complete security question that specifies:
- What specific vulnerability scenario should I investigate?
- Which attack vector or system component should I focus on?
- What invariant violation or exploit path should I analyze?

For example, a complete security question might be:
- "Can a malicious transaction sender bypass gas metering in the Move VM?"
- "Can a validator manipulate voting power through stake pool state corruption?"
- "Can consensus safety be violated during epoch transitions?"

Without the specific security question, I cannot:
- Identify which code paths to investigate
- Determine which attack surface to explore
- Validate whether any findings are relevant to your audit scope
- Provide a targeted and meaningful security analysis

Please provide the complete security question, and I will perform a thorough security audit following the detailed methodology you've outlined.
