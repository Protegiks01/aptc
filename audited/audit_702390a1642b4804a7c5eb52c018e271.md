I notice that the **Security Question** in your prompt is incomplete. The prompt shows:

"**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File:"

followed by citations from `network/framework/src/peer_manager/transport.rs`, but there is no actual security question posed.

To perform a proper security audit, I need a specific security question or vulnerability scenario to investigate. For example:
- "Can malicious peers exploit the transport layer to cause denial of service?"
- "Are there race conditions in connection handling that could affect consensus?"
- "Can attackers bypass authentication in peer connections?"

Without a complete security question, I cannot conduct the investigation you've outlined. Please provide the full security question you'd like me to analyze, and I'll thoroughly investigate the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to that specific concern.

If you intended to ask about a specific security aspect of the `transport.rs` file or the transport layer in general, please clarify the question and I'll proceed with the audit accordingly.
