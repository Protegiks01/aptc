I notice that the **Security Question (scope for this run)** field appears to be incomplete or missing. The prompt shows:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-labs/aptos-core

This appears to be cut off and does not contain an actual security question for me to investigate.

According to the instructions provided, I should:
- Analyze the codebase "through the lens of this single security question"
- "Accept the premise of the security question and explore all relevant code paths"
- Only report on vulnerabilities "tied to the question"

However, without a specific security question or vulnerability hypothesis to investigate, I cannot perform a targeted security audit as requested.

**To proceed with the audit, I need:**

1. A complete security question or vulnerability hypothesis to investigate (e.g., "Can malicious validators manipulate quorum certificates to cause consensus splits?", "Can attackers bypass gas metering in native Move functions?", etc.)

2. Any specific files, functions, or code paths that should be the focus of the investigation

3. Any additional context about what type of vulnerability or attack vector should be prioritized

Please provide the complete security question so I can conduct a thorough and targeted security analysis of the Aptos Core codebase.
