I notice that your security question appears to be incomplete. The query states:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/aptos-move/

And then cuts off mid-sentence. There is no actual security question or vulnerability scenario for me to investigate.

To conduct a proper security audit, I need you to provide:
1. **A complete security question or hypothesis** - What specific vulnerability, attack vector, or security concern should I investigate?
2. **The scope** - Which specific files, components, or mechanisms should I focus on?
3. **The attack scenario** - What type of exploit or security issue are you concerned about?

For example, a complete security question might be:
- "Can an attacker manipulate JWK consensus configuration updates to bypass governance controls?"
- "Are there race conditions in the JWK consensus config update mechanism that could lead to state inconsistencies?"
- "Can malicious validators exploit the JWK consensus configuration to compromise consensus safety?"

Please provide the complete security question you'd like me to investigate, and I'll conduct a thorough security analysis following the audit framework you've outlined.
