I cannot perform the security audit because the security question appears to be incomplete. 

The query shows:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/aptos-move

This cuts off mid-sentence and doesn't specify the actual security concern or vulnerability scenario I should investigate in the `code_cache_global_manager.rs` file or related components.

To conduct a proper security audit, I need:

1. **A complete security question** that specifies what vulnerability, attack vector, or invariant violation to investigate
2. **Clear scope** about what specific security concern to analyze (e.g., "Can the global module cache be poisoned to cause consensus divergence?", "Are there race conditions in cache updates that could break deterministic execution?", etc.)

Without a complete security question, I cannot:
- Determine which code paths and invariants to examine
- Identify what attack scenarios to validate
- Perform the required validation checklist
- Produce a meaningful audit report

Please provide the complete security question so I can perform the thorough security analysis you've requested.
