## Title
Missing Minimum Validator Count Validation Allows Complete Network Halt Through Empty Validator Set

## Summary
The `on_new_epoch` function in the staking system filters validators based on minimum stake requirements but fails to enforce a minimum validator count. If all validators' stake falls below the minimum threshold, the active validator set becomes empty, causing irreversible consensus failure and total network halt.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the epoch transition logic where validators are removed without ensuring at least one validator remains active.

**Critical Code Path:**

The `on_new_epoch` function filters validators by checking if their voting power meets the minimum stake requirement. However, there is no validation to ensure at least one validator remains after filtering. [1](#0-0) 

The function iterates through all validators and only includes those with sufficient stake in `next_epoch_validators`. If no validators meet the requirement, the vector remains empty, and this empty vector directly replaces the active validator set without any validation.

**Comparison with voluntary exit protection:**

The `leave_validator_set` function explicitly prevents removing the last validator through the `ELAST_VALIDATOR` check. [2](#0-1) 

However, this protection does NOT exist in `on_new_epoch` for automatic removal due to insufficient stake, creating an asymmetry in validator set safety guarantees.

**Rust-side validation gaps:**

The `ValidatorVerifier` constructor accepts empty validator sets and sets `quorum_voting_power` to 0. [3](#0-2) 

This creates a technically valid but operationally broken verifier that cannot support consensus operations.

**Consensus failure points:**

When the consensus system attempts to create proposer election with an empty validator set, multiple failure modes occur:

1. For `FixedProposer` election, the `choose_leader` function panics with "No trusted peers found!" [4](#0-3) 

2. For `RoundProposer` election, it panics with "INVARIANT VIOLATION: proposers is empty" [5](#0-4) 

3. For `RotatingProposer` election, accessing the proposer causes division by zero when `proposers.len()` is 0. [6](#0-5) 

**Function specification confirms no-abort design:**

The specification explicitly states `aborts_if false`, meaning `on_new_epoch` is designed to never abort, even when producing an empty validator set. [7](#0-6) 

**No validation in governance updates:**

The `validate_required_stake` function only checks that `minimum_stake <= maximum_stake`, with no validation that the new minimum is achievable by current validators. [8](#0-7) 

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Governance raises `minimum_stake` significantly (legitimate governance action)
2. Current validators' stakes are below the new threshold
3. Next epoch begins, `on_new_epoch` executes
4. All validators are filtered out due to insufficient stake
5. `active_validators` becomes empty vector
6. `ValidatorSet` is stored on-chain with zero active validators
7. Consensus reads empty `ValidatorSet` from on-chain config [9](#0-8) 
8. `ValidatorVerifier` is created with 0 validators and `quorum_voting_power = 0` [10](#0-9) 
9. Proposer election creation panics with empty proposers [11](#0-10) 
10. Chain permanently halts - requires hard fork to recover

## Impact Explanation

**Severity: CRITICAL** (up to $1,000,000)

This vulnerability causes **"Total loss of liveness/network availability"** and **"Non-recoverable network partition (requires hardfork)"**, both explicitly listed as Critical severity in the Aptos bug bounty program.

Once the validator set becomes empty:
- No blocks can be proposed (proposer election panics)
- No consensus can be reached (no voting power available)
- The chain is permanently halted
- Requires a hard fork with manual validator set injection to recover
- All economic activity freezes
- Smart contracts become inaccessible
- Funds are effectively frozen until hard fork recovery

This breaks the fundamental **Consensus Liveness** invariant - the network cannot maintain liveness with zero validators.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Likelihood: MEDIUM to HIGH**

While requiring all validators to have insufficient stake seems unlikely on mature mainnets, several realistic scenarios make this exploitable:

1. **Governance-driven minimum stake increases**: If governance raises `minimum_stake` significantly without verifying current validator stakes, all could become ineligible simultaneously. The validation function provides no protection against this. [12](#0-11) 

2. **Small validator set configurations**: Testnets or newly launched networks with few validators are highly vulnerable.

3. **Economic conditions**: During market downturns or low staking rewards, multiple validators might simultaneously unlock stake, pushing all below minimum threshold.

4. **No reversal mechanism**: Once triggered in epoch N, the empty validator set is committed for epoch N+1 with no recovery path in the protocol.

The vulnerability doesn't require malicious actors - it can occur through legitimate governance decisions or operational choices under adverse conditions.

## Recommendation

Add a minimum validator count validation in the `on_new_epoch` function:

```move
// After line 1399 in stake.move, before line 1401:
assert!(
    vector::length(&next_epoch_validators) > 0,
    error::invalid_state(EZERO_VALIDATORS)
);
validator_set.active_validators = next_epoch_validators;
```

Additionally, add validation in `update_required_stake` to prevent setting a minimum stake that would eliminate all current validators:

```move
// In staking_config.move, update validate_required_stake to check against current validator stakes
public fun update_required_stake(
    aptos_framework: &signer,
    minimum_stake: u64,
    maximum_stake: u64,
) acquires StakingConfig {
    system_addresses::assert_aptos_framework(aptos_framework);
    validate_required_stake(minimum_stake, maximum_stake);
    
    // Add validation that at least one current validator meets the new minimum
    let validator_set = borrow_global<ValidatorSet>(@aptos_framework);
    let at_least_one_valid = /* check if any active validator has stake >= minimum_stake */;
    assert!(at_least_one_valid, error::invalid_argument(EWOULD_ELIMINATE_ALL_VALIDATORS));
    
    let staking_config = borrow_global_mut<StakingConfig>(@aptos_framework);
    staking_config.minimum_stake = minimum_stake;
    staking_config.maximum_stake = maximum_stake;
}
```

## Proof of Concept

While a complete PoC would require a full testnet setup, the execution path is deterministic:

1. Deploy a test network with validators having stake = 1000 each
2. Submit governance proposal to set `minimum_stake = 2000`
3. Wait for epoch transition
4. Observe `on_new_epoch` filters all validators (none have stake >= 2000)
5. Consensus initialization panics when attempting to create proposer election with empty validator set
6. Network halts permanently

The vulnerability is demonstrated by the code evidence showing that `on_new_epoch` has no minimum count validation, while proposer election constructors all panic or fail with empty validator sets.

## Notes

This vulnerability represents a critical gap in the defense-in-depth strategy for validator set management. While `leave_validator_set` correctly prevents voluntary removal of the last validator, the automatic filtering in `on_new_epoch` has no such protection. The formal specification's `aborts_if false` guarantee actually makes the vulnerability worse by ensuring the empty validator set is committed to chain state rather than causing an early abort that might be more recoverable.
