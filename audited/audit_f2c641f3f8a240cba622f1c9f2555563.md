# Analysis Result

I cannot complete this security audit because **the security question is incomplete**.

The provided query states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs] [Function

The question cuts off after "Function" without specifying:
- Which function to analyze
- What specific security concern to investigate  
- What vulnerability claim to validate

## What I Need to Proceed

To conduct a proper security audit, I would need:

1. **Complete security question**: What specific vulnerability or security concern should I investigate in this file?
2. **Target function**: Which function(s) in `read_record_bytes.rs` should be the focus?
3. **Attack scenario**: What threat model or exploit path am I validating?

## Current Context

The file `storage/backup/backup-cli/src/utils/read_record_bytes.rs` [1](#0-0)  implements functionality for reading record bytes during backup operations, but without a specific security question, I cannot determine what vulnerability to investigate.

**Please provide the complete security question so I can perform the requested audit.**
