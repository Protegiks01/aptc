I cannot complete this security audit because **the security question is incomplete**.

The query states:

> **Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: aptos-core/aptos-move/aptos-release-builder/src/components/oidc_providers.rs] [Function:

The question cuts off after "[Function:" without specifying:
1. Which function to analyze (the file contains `generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal` and `write_op`)
2. What specific security concern or vulnerability to investigate
3. What attack vector or invariant violation to examine [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

## Information Needed

To conduct a proper security audit, I need:

1. **Complete function specification**: Which function(s) should I analyze?
   - `generate_oidc_provider_ops_proposal`?
   - `write_op`?
   - Both?

2. **Specific security concern**: What aspect should I investigate?
   - Input validation?
   - Code injection risks?
   - Access control?
   - State management?
   - Other vulnerability class?

3. **Attack scenario**: What threat model should I consider?
   - Malicious governance proposal submitter?
   - Compromised configuration files?
   - On-chain exploitation?

## Notes

This file is part of the release builder tooling that generates governance proposals for OIDC provider management. Without a complete question, I cannot determine whether to analyze it from the perspective of:
- Build-time security (YAML deserialization, code generation)
- Runtime security (on-chain execution)
- Governance security (proposal manipulation)

Please provide the complete security question so I can perform the requested audit.
