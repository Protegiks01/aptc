I cannot proceed with this security audit because the **Security Question** that should define the scope of investigation appears to be incomplete or corrupted.

## Issue with the Query

The prompt shows:

```
**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File:

### Citations

**File:** third_party/move/move-bytecode-verifier/bytecode-verifier-tests/src/unit_tests/control_flow_tests.rs (L14-37)
```

This appears to be:
1. An incomplete or truncated security question
2. Followed by a citation to a **test file** (which is explicitly out of scope per your instructions: "Files in Scope: All source files in the repository, excluding test files and documentation")

## What I Need to Proceed

To conduct a proper security audit, I need:

1. **A complete security question** - For example:
   - "Can bytecode verification be bypassed to deploy malicious Move modules?"
   - "Are there race conditions in the consensus voting mechanism?"
   - "Can gas metering be exploited in native function calls?"
   - etc.

2. **Clear scope definition** - What specific vulnerability class or attack vector should I investigate based on this question?

Without a well-defined security question, I cannot:
- Identify relevant code paths to investigate
- Determine which invariants to validate
- Assess potential attack vectors
- Provide a meaningful audit report

**Please provide the complete security question so I can perform the requested security audit.**
