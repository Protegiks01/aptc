I cannot proceed with the security audit because the security question is incomplete. 

The query states:

**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File: config/src/config/mempool_config.rs] [Struct: MempoolConfig] Can setting

The question cuts off after "Can setting" and does not specify:
- Which field or parameter in `MempoolConfig` is being questioned
- What security concern is being raised about that setting
- What potential vulnerability or impact is being explored

To perform a thorough security audit as requested, I need the **complete security question** that specifies:

1. Which specific configuration field(s) in `MempoolConfig` are under scrutiny
2. What specific security concern or attack vector is being investigated
3. What the complete question is asking about (e.g., "Can setting X to Y cause Z vulnerability?")

Please provide the full, complete security question so I can conduct a proper analysis following the strict validation checklist and audit methodology outlined in your instructions.
